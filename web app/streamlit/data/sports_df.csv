Washington Post,"By telling the truth, Dave Roberts sparks Shohei Ohtani free agency frenzy",2023-12-05 19:19:00,Chelsea Janes,"NASHVILLE — Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, who woke up Tuesday with a pristine baseball legacy that included a curse-breaking stolen base and a relentlessly successful career, did the unthinkable Tuesday afternoon. Surrounded by reporters eager for comment on whether his team — the team seen as the favorite to land Shohei Ohtani for years, one of few teams with the money to do it, the team located mere minutes from the place Ohtani has made his home since he came to the United States from Japan — met with the two-way star, Roberts told the truth.“I would like to be honest,” Roberts said. “So we met with Shohei and we talked and I think it went well.”And just like that, a maddeningly quiet MLB winter meetings was consumed by sudden sound and fury, because everyone at Gaylord Opryland knew that Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, had made it clear to his suitors that any leaks about which teams the biggest baseball star on the planet might be meeting with would be held against them.“Twenty-eight more managers and he’s ours!” joked a front-office member whose team never had much chance. The Dodgers, meanwhile, were not laughing much at all. When the Los Angeles Times asked Dodgers team president Andrew Friedman to comment on Roberts’s comments, or on the team’s pursuit of Ohtani, he said he would not. When their general manager, Brandon Gomes, met with reporters as part of a scheduled session a few minutes later, he chose his words carefully.“Dave made a comment, for us personally, we don’t feel comfortable going into it any further,” Gomes said, citing the loosely heeded rule against free agent tampering as he reason for his unwillingness to say anything. Asked whether he thought the breach would hurt the Dodgers’ chances of signing Ohtani, he said, “I have no idea.”“I think this is all so personal, and like I said we’re not going to go into free agent world making comments,” Gomes said. “But it’s going to play out how it’s going to play out.”How Ohtani’s free agency has played out, to this point, is a fury of speculation fueled by silence — both from teams too scared to violate the stated rules of Ohtani’s process and from Ohtani himself. The biggest star in the sport has not spoken publicly since he injured his elbow in August, a conspicuous drought for the most prominent baseball player in the world navigating a career-threatening injury weeks before he became the most coveted free agent anyone can remember.Last month, after he was named the American League MVP for the second time, Ohtani skipped a scheduled conference call with reporters. When a Sports Illustrated reporter tried to learn the name of the dog Ohtani held in his arms as the award was announced on MLB Network, members of Ohtani’s team and the Angels all said they could not comment. The MLB Network hosts knew better than to ask for information as personal as that.So for more than a month now, the entire industry has been searching for clues. Monday, they found a few. Ohtani followed San Francisco Giants pitcher Logan Webb on Instagram, the clearest indication yet that he may potentially be considering the Giants as a landing spot, as some had expected he might. Later in the day, Toronto Blue Jays Manager John Schneider was unavailable for his long-scheduled news conference, and General Manager Ross Atkins was nowhere to be found in Nashville. A Blue Jays fan tracked down flights from Anaheim to Clearwater, Fla., near the team’s spring training home. When Schneider ambled into his rescheduled news conference Tuesday, cameras followed him closely and questions ranging from “did you meet with Ohtani” to “you look tan, were you in Florida to meet with Ohtani” greeted him.“I live in Florida, so I arrived here last night,” Schneider said. “I think who we meet with and where we meet them, we keep to ourselves.”Schneider repeated the second part of that answer several times. Not long after, new Chicago Cubs manager Craig Counsell dodged similar questions about his team’s pursuit by insisting that he, specifically, had not met with Ohtani, even when someone asked if his team had instead.“I don’t think this is my spot to talk about individual players,” Counsell said.But the reality of the situation, whatever they say, is that no one wants to talk about this specific player. New York Yankees Manager Aaron Boone, for example, beamed and joked when a reporter asked him whether he thought Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto — who has not made similar demands for secrecy — would look good in pinstripes.“I think he probably would,” Boone said, before offering that 25-year-old pitchers of Yamamoto’s caliber are difficult to find and that he expects to meet with him soon. Ohtani is now, as ever, something completely different. And that is why what Roberts did Tuesday, when he admitted the Dodgers hosted Ohtani at Dodger Stadium for a few hours last week, when he explained that they tried to answer Ohtani’s questions and give him a sense of who they are, was treated by his own colleagues like a disclosure of intolerable proportions.“It’s pretty easy to have conversations with anyone if you feel comfortable in what you’re about, who you work with,” Roberts said. “We’re about people, we’re about winning, and so I think that that’s pretty easy to talk about … there’s no hiding of the ball, it’s just kind of, here we are, and we really hope he feels it’s a fit.”",5409,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/05/dodgers-shohei-ohtani-free-agency-dave-roberts/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,nez reason giant dodger specific hour counsell violate schneider eager explain home found time winter silence blue minute sudden situation arm successful quiet star insist legacy honest scar award elbow reality sport afternoon personally loosely big free gomes andrew training question robert japanese news disclosure dave individual cub ohtani month played announce league dodge knew joked live easy york greet breach angeles comment jay potentially probably ross search agency hiding tracked conversation atkins demand give leak yankee yamamoto yoshinobu balelo fury talk boone base entire follow general world day word relentlessly camera rule mvp point webb comfortable planet offering make toronto san completely agent clear feel tamper shohei friedman long pitcher answer baseball signing similar player spring schedule repeat suitor night monday session industry united process meeting career maddeningly hurt craig caliber ball unavailable spoken specifically ace beam secrecy clearwater win woke find difficult consider conspicuous covet locate opryland told year state hope navigate network publicly treat angel gaylord flight mlb favorite instagram clearest drought kind florida fit nashville personal heed pretty unwillingness expect speculation money team fuel conference chose manager clue francisco logan arrive information colleague reschedule different john include place sound closely reporter american range steal pursuit land chicago august japan member laugh injured admit injury meet learn surround amble held indication part illustrate brandon intolerable pristine skip call prominent consume unthinkable chance anaheim aaron stadium work play host president spot week tuesday,0.99195,0.1109262340543538,7.571807447774749,0.4729803229803231,0,2023-12-05

But Washington was ineligible to pick in the top six because the collective bargaining agreement states a team that pays in the revenue-sharing plan cannot have a lottery pick in back-to-back years, and the Nationals chose outfielder Dylan Crews with the No. 2 selection this year.The ping-pong balls were redrawn, and 8-14-10-7 were selected, a Guardians combination. The results were presented about two hours later on MLB Network in the televised show from a ballroom at the winter meetings.The Guardians will pick first for the first time in franchise history after finishing the 2023 season 76-86, tied for the 22nd-best record among the 30 teams. Based on lottery odds, Cleveland jumped all the way up from the No. 9 slot, while Cincinnati moved from 13th to second.Cleveland has selected second five times since the amateur draft started in 1965, most recently taking Paul Shuey in 1992.West Virginia infielder JJ Wetherholt, Wake Forest first baseman Nick Kurtz and right-hander Chase Burns, Oregon State second baseman Travis Bazzana and Florida first baseman and left-hander Jac Caglianone are among the early projections as possibilities for top picks.The draft lottery, whereby the 18 teams that do not reach the postseason vie for the first six selections, was introduced in MLB's new collective bargaining agreement that went into effect last year.The Nos. 7 to 18 picks are slotted by reverse winning percentage, followed by how teams finished in the postseason.The A's, who had the worst record in the big leagues at 50-112, dropped to fourth after falling to sixth last year when finishing with the second-worst mark. Oakland will be ineligible for a top-six selection in 2025 because it receives revenue-sharing money and already will have had two straight top-six picks.The Pirates won the inaugural draft lottery last year and selected pitcher Paul Skenes at No. 1.The projected 2024 draft order is as follows:",2678,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/guardians-win-mlb-draft-lottery-pick-1-franchise/story?id=105405785,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,top amateur caglianone ineligible vie pitcher draw jumped national hour cincinnati paul time winter agreement dylan select televise postseason start reverse earn guardian jac ball wetherholt burn win kansa percentage draft possibility big pay mark louis opryland convention year state network effect angel gaylord move odds skenes oregon mlb city white receives introduce project florida forest lottery projection baseman fall money team chose league recently kurtz chase center slot nick infielder pittsburgh early order angeles shuey pirate include inaugural virginia resort rockies history season beat texas royal outfielder ballroom july collective franchise cleveland selection chicago record drop tie combination plan present finish wake sox base follow fourth athletics straight crew sixth oakland result reach travis red pick arlington chance washington bazzana redrawn jj show bargaining colorado tuesday,0.92805,0.0,11.507315010570824,0.2892466329966329,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Off-duty pilot accused of trying to cut plane’s engines faces 84 counts,2023-12-05 18:20:00,Lori Aratani,"A Multnomah County, Ore., grand jury on Monday indicted an off-duty pilot on 83 counts of recklessly endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft, but determined that he should not face attempted murder charges, after he was accused of trying to shut down a plane’s engines during a flight in October.Joseph David Emerson, 44, a pilot for Alaska Airlines, was flying in the jump seat in the cockpit of a San Francisco-bound Horizon Air flight Oct. 22 when authorities say he tried to shut down the plane’s engines by activating an emergency system. His attempt was thwarted by the plane’s pilots.The flight was diverted to Portland International Airport, where Emerson was taken into custody. No injuries were reported.Emerson told police he thought he was dreaming and was trying to wake up when he tried to grab two handles that activate the plane’s fire suppression system. He also told investigators he had been struggling with depression, had taken psychedelic mushrooms 48 hours earlier and hadn’t slept for 40 hours before he boarded the flight.He is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday.Emerson was initially charged with 83 felony counts of attempted murder, 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one count of endangering an aircraft, a felony.“The attempted murder charges were never appropriate in this case because Captain Emerson never intended to hurt another person or put anyone at risk — he just wanted to return home to his wife and children,” Emerson’s lawyers said in a statement. “Simply put: Captain Emerson thought he was in a dream; his actions were taken in a single-minded effort to wake up from that dream and return home to his family.”Emerson’s attorneys said they were disappointed that he still faces charges in the case.“Captain Emerson had no criminal intent, and we look forward to being able to present a fulsome defense at trial and bring forth all the facts and circumstances to a jury,” the statement said.The incident prompted calls for the Federal Aviation Administration to reexamine the system it uses to evaluate pilot mental health. The agency established a committee that will recommend ways to remove barriers pilots face when reporting mental health concerns. The same committee also will look at similar issues facing air traffic controllers.The National Transportation Safety Board has scheduled a summit for Wednesday on pilot mental health.",2425,https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/12/05/alaska-airlines-pilot-indicted/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,emergency forward portland mental national indict authority hour case safety similar child schedule home effort psychedelic charge transportation monday board administration grand fact slept hurt grab evaluate criminal plane international appropriate jury issue endangerment dream horizon reckless remove determine federal told barrier struggle action recklessly system county committee seat alaska fulsome intend flight reexamine murder jump fly thwart summit recommend aviation incident prompt traffic statement accuse concern bring multnomah david air activate arraign risk airline disappointed emerson fire endanger attorney wednesday pilot person count misdemeanor lawyer return trial reporting agency mushroom circumstance depression injury airport present establish custody captain wake handle divert health shut aircraft defense felony earlier initially intent call investigator attempt cockpit suppression put simply engine wife police san,-0.96075,0.9896907216494846,11.258298850574713,0.3520541549953315,0,2023-12-05

ABC,Roger Goodell says football will become a global sport in a decade,2023-12-05 16:47:00,MARK ANDERSON AP sports writer,"LAS VEGAS -- NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sees football becoming a global sport within the next decade, with his league at the forefront of that effort.That includes, Goodell said Tuesday, adding another international market to next year's regular-season schedule. He wasn't specific, but Brazil and Spain are the front-runners. An announcement is expected in the next month or two.“We’re really excited about that,” Goodell said of entering a new market. “I don’t see that as much as expanding the number of franchises as I do expanding the opportunity for people to really just enjoy the game.”Goodell was speaking at a forum that included officials from Las Vegas teams and events to promote the Super Bowl, which will be played at Allegiant Stadium on Feb. 11.He said the league's championship game will return to Las Vegas many times after this season.“I think probably I would not have said 10 years ago that I would see myself sitting here for a Super Bowl,” Goodell said. “But I’m not surprised because I think the leadership here in this community saw the opportunity and had the vision. One thing I’ve seen, when they get involved, they’re going to get something.”Goodell said, according to CBS, that advertising sold out for this Super Bowl earlier than usual.The Super Bowl was touted at the forum as the biggest event to ever occur in Las Vegas, a city known for hosting major events, including a Formula One race that recently took place.But now the city also is becoming known as a professional sports town, and the Raiders have played no small part in that.“(The NFL's) commitment to Las Vegas matters to us,” said Steve Hill, president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. “You have changed Las Vegas. Allegiant Stadium has changed Las Vegas.”Goodell said Las Vegas even furthers the mission to grow the game globally because it's an international destination.He said the fact the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles is adding flag football will benefit the NFL's mission to grow the game beyond the nation's shores.That has been the league's goal since it began playing regular-season in other countries about 15 years ago. Five regular-season games were played overseas this season — three in the London and two in Germany.“I am convinced that this game is going to be a global sport,” Goodell said. ""We could've sold over our two games in Germany 4.5 million tickets. They sold out in minutes. And it’s literally the same with the U.K. I think you’re going to see a very global NFL, not necessarily with franchises, but maybe like have one playing games on a global basis.

Washington Post,"Against all odds, the NCAA is finally trying to do something smart",2023-12-05 16:24:00,not specified,"Among the many gawkish scenes of a sport in uncertain transition, nothing will feel more “College Football in 2023” years from now than multimillionaire coaches, fresh from leveraging schools to outbid each other for their limited services, asking you, the fan, to chip in a spare $100 or so to sort of pay their players or else your favorite team will lose.Even by this sport’s acidic levels of inanity, coaches soliciting name, image and likeness (NIL) funds in their current format looks upper-echelon stupid: When second-year Connecticut coach Jim Mora Jr. was pressed on why the Huskies slumped from 6-7 to 3-9 this season, he absolved himself of any blame by telling U-Conn. fans “they didn’t have the right to [complain]” if they were unwilling to pony up cash for a Huskies NIL collective Mora said he didn’t believe was competitive enough.Moments after beating rival North Carolina in November, North Carolina State Coach Dave Doeren asked for 5,000 Wolfpack fans to donate $1,000 each to the school’s NIL initiatives because “some bad stuff is going on,” alluding to a vague threat that N.C. State players would be poached by richer schools in the upcoming transfer window.And Kentucky’s Mark Stoops justified his team’s annual implosion against reigning national champion Georgia by claiming the Bulldogs “bought some pretty good players,” implying Kentucky didn’t because they couldn’t … because Kentucky fans didn’t pay up. After all, the school can’t, and Stoops certainly can’t, either.Thankfully, Tuesday brought news of a bold new proposal from the NCAA, spearheaded by first-year president Charlie Baker, to end the charade of the circumvented compensation model of an NIL-only format and allow for a new Division I subdivision defined exclusively by a school’s ability to compensate athletes directly.Baker’s proposal, still in its infancy and yet to be formally approved by the NCAA, would let any NCAA member school opt into the subdivision as long as it was financially capable of compensating at least half of its athletes at least $30,000 per year and meet Title IX requirements for gender equity that the current, unregulated NIL system doesn’t consider.It is, quite simply, the smartest thing the NCAA has ever done, or rather, might do. And its newsworthiness lies in that simplicity after decades of heinous obfuscation: Schools can simply pay athletes directly, via a trust.That’s it.There’s no limit, either; just the $30,000 minimum per athlete. Plus, NIL initiatives would still be permitted so athletes can pursue revenue from endorsements, just not as a sole means of compensation. So if a school can budget for the estimated $6 million for minimum payments (that’s bar napkin math for a large athletic department carrying around 400 scholarship athletes), it’s in.Of course, this new “payroll” subdivision would compete under the NCAA’s guidelines and control, thus keeping the organization alive into the next era of college athletics. After the NCAA was so thoroughly trounced by the Supreme Court in 2021, speculation that moneyed schools would simply break away altogether grew. Tuesday’s development is an attempt to stymie that idea.This proposal would all but completely wipe out the infamous “bag man” culture that the NCAA cartel demonized and privileged academic elites (read: rich White people) condemned as immoral, even in the face of overwhelming inequity between schools and players.Now, if Stoops wants to “buy” some Georgia-level players to beat Georgia, he might need to volunteer to take a pay cut — or Kentucky might ask him to take one — because for the first time in history, the true cost of college football personnel might finally become an official line item, on the books, direct from school to player. And if winning is that simple — as coaches such as Stoops told us — it kind of makes you wonder what his $9 million salary buys you in the first place.The advent of player payroll might explain some of the school-side anxiety in the coaching market this hiring-and-firing cycle. So that sound you hear might be the guttural screams of coaching agents faced with trimmer margins for future contracts, at least the ones not well connected enough to pivot to college players.How programs will value coaches monetarily will be affected by the actual size of their player payroll. Nothing in Baker’s proposal would stop the largest and richest programs from paying far, far past the minimum.It’s a no-brainer to assume every school in the Big Ten and SEC would buy in immediately, and it’s safe to assume the Big 12 and ACC would follow. A handful of programs considered “Group of Five” might be able to swing a minimum payroll or higher, but most of their peers and rivals won’t, potentially breaking apart those conferences.The proposed structure inches college football closer to the future super league concept I mentioned in August after the Pac-12 was ripped apart for TV money. This entire proposal exists to separate nine-figure athletic budgets such as Alabama’s and Ohio State’s from the same legislative structure making rules for Louisiana Monroe and Bowling Green. But it absolutely will not come without its own internal divisions if no player compensation limit is set (and it probably won’t be, under threat of labor law).Player compensation gaps will inevitably emerge inside each conference, even the big ones — Ohio State will surely pay more than Purdue; same for Alabama compared with Mississippi State — and eventually the tribal identity of the sport will migrate completely from history and geography to economics and marketability.After everything college football has seen the past two years, it’s really not that hard to envision: Schools with similar financial identities and national footprints will unite around shared problems and interests to maintain their dominance. It’s highly likely all four of this year’s playoff teams — Michigan, Washington, Texas and Alabama — will find enough in common to separate from historical partners in lesser financial health during the next cycle of television rights (or however games will be broadcast to viewers not in physical attendance) in the mid-2030s.If this sounds too fantastic or somehow impossible, that’s an emotional response, not a factual one. College football’s recent behavior almost demands we’re headed in the direction of an NFL-style, region-free, professional super league.It’s also not the fault of any potential player compensation strategy. Baker’s proposal is an attempt by the unlikeliest of entities to balance what has happened over the course of recent decades but especially recent years — aggressive consolidation orchestrated and obfuscated by TV networks, allowing for a glut of money to inflate coaching salaries to insane levels while suppressing the agency of labor.",6833,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/05/ncaa-economic-proposal-smart/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RMUB7ZWJUP2BGJUDQSCHK67WVI.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RMUB7ZWJUP2BGJUDQSCHK67WVI.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RMUB7ZWJUP2BGJUDQSCHK67WVI.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RMUB7ZWJUP2BGJUDQSCHK67WVI.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RMUB7ZWJUP2BGJUDQSCHK67WVI.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RMUB7ZWJUP2BGJUDQSCHK67WVI.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,leverage sole direction closer infancy mississippi ripped subdivision spare national orchestrate reign sec contract compete explain time math exclusively group happen wolfpack payment compensation demonize richer anxiety item legislative impossible title super outbid sport fund book historical salary athletic format big pay claim mention lie pivot north set lesser hard requirement system elite gap development high news white emotional cost game guideline cycle dave footprint justified monroe richest heinous budget newsworthiness hear gawkish equity approve ix league altogether separate acidic common strategy academic tribal circumvent balance condemn upcoming potentially acc season history emerge beat texas probably monetarily husky television past football connect stop beating stupid finally agency envision transition college solicit actual rival demand simplicity suppress control broadcast fault culture away limit read donate surely tv advent compensate professional follow entire health chip unregulated obfuscate limited rule blame ncaa moneyed ohio future unwilling attempt department large endorsement cash guttural personnel half safe athlete slump buy simply coach ability labor make inch michigan baker grow spearhead behavior completely share agent identity feel law maintain georgia propose fantastic sort long inevitably overwhelm response structure pursue insane proposal alabama similar financial player wonder decade playoff scholarship connecticut stoop smartest purdue define scream likeness directly handful course vague charade immediately size simple service volunteer million aggressive obfuscation believe absolutely affected dominance concept competitive imply margin current win highly scene napkin find inanity image consider break stuff mark wipe bought inflate bulldog initiative year organization told unlikeliest state opt interest inside network entity program rich bag favorite physical cartel kind official trimmer unite transfer champion nil pretty gender value carry louisiana pony migrate annual speculation stymie money team conference privileged factual recent minimum direct glut exists geography infamous market cut line problem bold kentucky payroll potential sound inequity compare financially fresh immoral brought revenue collective absolve trounce model allude internal especially eventually august alive member meet press complain consolidation bar ten permit swing level doeren bowling capable athletics uncertain formally assume multimillionaire supreme threat division implosion november charlie economics head court peer green school washington partner carolina viewer estimate poach attendance president tuesday,0.98895,0.1317137421337626,10.370880503144653,0.4780691530691529,0,2023-12-05
Fox News,Giants sticking with local legend Tommy DeVito at quarterback despite Tyrod Taylor's return,2023-12-05 16:10:00,Scott Thompson,"The New York Giants won't be straying away from the local legend that has become Tommy DeVito at quarterback despite seeing their original backup healthy again.Tyrod Taylor, who was dealing with a rib injury he suffered in Week 8 against the New York Jets, was designated for return off the injured reserve this week. With his practice window open, it’s expected that Taylor could suit up for the Giants on Monday night against the Green Bay Packers.However, head coach Brian Daboll is riding with DeVito, the New Jersey native who fans have gravitated toward since Taylor and Daniel Jones went out with injury.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMTommy DeVito of the New York Giants attempts a pass against the New England Patriots at MetLife Stadium on Nov. 26, 2023, in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

""Thought he’s played well the last two games, made good decisions, was accurate with the football, earned the right to play.""Daboll’s statement on DeVito, and deciding to announce the starting quarterback role this early in the week, proves that this is DeVito’s job to lose for the remainder of the season.FRO OUTKICK: JA’MARR CHASE SAYS HE WANTED TO BE AN ‘EVIL PERSON’ AGAINST JAGUARS, BACKED IT UP WITH MONSTER GAMEThe Syracuse product, who played his high school football not far from MetLife Stadium at Don Bosco Prep, has done well since taking over the starting role from Taylor.Though the Giants were dominated by the Dallas Cowboys on Nov. 12 in his first start, DeVito has helped the Giants win back-to-back games, including their Week 12 matchup against the New England Patriots. DeVito was efficient, going 17-of-25 through the air with a touchdown to Isaiah Hodgins.His best game, though, came on the road against the Washington Commanders, where DeVito threw for 246 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions.New York Giants quarterback Tommy DeVito speaks during a news conference after the Dallas Cowboys game, Nov. 12, 2023, in Arlington, Texas.

Washington Post,"The Dallas Cowboys have plenty of doubters, but a legitimate résumé",2023-12-05 15:55:00,Neil Greenberg,"The Dallas Cowboys have won 14 straight games at home, the longest streak in the NFL and just four shy of the franchise record. They are one of four teams in the NFC with at least nine wins, and have won six of their past seven games. They have the best point differential in the NFL, have scored the most points in the NFL and are tied for the fewest turnovers in the NFL. Still, it’s hard for some to take them seriously as Super Bowl contenders, with that argument centering on the team’s mediocre record on the road and a perceived padded résumé against inferior opponents, combined with two losses against NFC contenders.That’s true enough. The Cowboys have faced below-average opponents at home, teams with a collective winning percentage of .394, on par with a six or seven-win team over the course of the season. Yet there are reasons to look beyond that perceived knock and the head-to-head losses to the San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles, and to consider the 9-3 Cowboys legitimate Super Bowl contenders.For one thing, they aren’t the only NFC power that has gotten healthy by beating up lesser teams. San Francisco — the betting favorite to win the NFC — has faced opponents with just a .455 combined winning percentage at home (projecting to a seven-win team, on average). And while the Cowboys have outscored their unimpressive opponents at home by an average 25.2 points, San Francisco has only outscored its opponents at home by an average 13.6 points, barely half the margin of victory the Cowboys rolled up against similar opponents.Results among common opponents paint a similar picture, and the Cowboys should not be penalized in public perception for dominating teams that others did not. Dallas beat the New York Giants by a combined score of 89-17 over two games, while San Francisco beat the Giants 30-12. (On the other hand, the Cowboys lost to the Arizona Cardinals by 12 and the 49ers beat Arizona by 19.) Dallas also beat the Los Angeles Rams by 23, far more than did the NFC-leading Eagles (11 points) or San Francisco (seven). The Cowboys soundly beat the New York Jets, 30-10, while the Eagles lost to Gang Green, 20-14. Games against the Washington Commanders and New England Patriots produced similar results: Dallas crushed those opponents while Philadelphia squeaked by. If we look at only this pool of games against common opponents and adjust each team’s margin of victory for strength of schedule and location, the 49ers have been 15.1 points per game better than an average team, the Cowboys have been 11.3 points better than an average team and the Eagles have been 5.9 points better than an average team. If anything, we should be more skeptical about Philadelphia’s chances than Dallas’s.Of course, Dallas and Philadelphia played head to head in Week 9, with the Eagles winning 28-23 at home. But let us look at that game in more detail. There were two plays which you could argue decided the outcome. Dallas couldn’t convert a fourth and goal on Philadelphia’s 1-yard line — the play was first ruled a touchdown but was overturned after a replay review — and then again on a fourth and eight on Philadelphia’s 29-yard line with less than two minutes remaining. But Dallas had far more total yards (406 to 292), more first downs (27 to 20) and a nearly equal time of possession (29:42 to 30:18) against a solid opponent on the road, so just chalking that game up as a failure for the Cowboys misses the bigger picture.Instead of looking at a subset of games — i.e., just games on the road or just games against top opponents — we should be concerned with a team’s overall performance, and so far Dallas looks every bit the part of a Super Bowl contender. For example the Cowboys rank fifth in analyst Aaron Schatz’s defense-adjusted value over average, a metric that breaks down every play and compares a team’s performance to a league-average baseline based on situation and opponent. San Francisco is No. 1 and Philadelphia is No. 9. ESPN’s Football Power Index, a measure of a team’s expected point margin versus an average opponent on a neutral field, has the same order, with the 49ers No. 1 (+10.7), the Cowboys No. 2 (+8.9) and the Eagles No. 7 (+5.5). Analyst Mike Beuoy’s betting market ratings also see San Francisco (No. 1, 8.8 points per game better than an average team on a neutral field) and Dallas (No. 2, 6.6) ahead of Philadelphia (No. 6, 4.5). And finally, while the 49ers are producing a league-leading 14.0 net points per game more than expected this season, the Cowboys (12.9) are second and the Baltimore Ravens (11.8) are third. The Eagles rank 11th (2.3).Then there’s the matter of Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, who probably isn’t getting enough attention. The 30-year-old passer has completed 70 percent of his passes for 3,234 yards and a league-leading 26 touchdowns. He is ranked as the second-best passer of 2023 per ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating, which values the quarterback’s play on a scale of 0 to 100, adjusting for the strength of opposing defenses faced. His rating of 75.6 suggests that his performance is good enough for a team to go 13-4 during a 17-game regular season. Dallas is 9-3 with an expected end-of-season win total of 12 games. The game charters at Pro Football Focus agree with the numbers, ranking Prescott No. 1 overall with the highest overall grade of his career. He is also in the top 5 in traditional metrics such as passing yards, completion percentage and passer rating. Any team with a quarterback like that is almost certain to be a championship contender.“Dak’s having one of the greatest seasons I’ve seen since I’ve been here,” Dallas edge rusher Micah Parsons told reporters last week. “It’s truly amazing to see the growth and where he’s at. I think right now he’s playing at the highest level in the NFL. Just from my standpoint what I’m seeing: Staying in the pocket, breaking sacks, making the right reads. He’s just playing terrific. This is the type of quarterback that’s going to win us the Super Bowl.”Parsons, meantime, leads a solid defense that is allowing 5.5 fewer points per game than expected, the fifth-best mark of 2023 and ahead of the 49ers (5.4, fifth) and Eagles (2.6 more points per game than expected, ranking 30th). Other Dallas standouts include defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa (the fifth-best payer at the position per the game charters at Pro Football Focus), DeMarcus Lawrence (the No. 9 edge rusher), DaRon Bland (the No. 1 corner with eight interceptions, including an NFL record five returned for touchdowns) and Malik Hooker (the No. 11 safety).",6601,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/05/dallas-cowboys-nfc-super-bowl-contender/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,reason giant dak passer home lose time percent average amaze baseline minute equal situation malik defensive squeak adjust growth failure opponent super shy contender picture oppose possession big ram public bland argue lesser hard stay jet dallas high tackle game yard project rating strength played miss england common york ranked order angeles combine bet bowl skeptical roll season beat probably inferior review micah subset return past football suggests beating finally differential touchdown crush convert legitimate parson record tie baltimore standpoint corner number read pro philadelphia fourth rusher base complete scale matter location result cardinal rule grade solid point cowboy half terrific outscore make san top penalize meantime knock field championship long espn demarcus safety similar schedule produce résumé goal commander quarterback eagle course streak career pocket paint total healthy victory odighizuwa margin patriot unimpressive win pass neutral percentage lawrence consider break loss mark type traditional told gang osa hand standouts index nfc mike hooker charter prescott perceive focus favorite pad regular beuoy schatz dominate detail measure value expect mediocre road argument position team soundly replay decide francisco raven performance passing market line center overturn great outcome analyst include attention compare reporter completion bit score remain agree collective nfl franchise chalk lead barely versus rank concerned pool turnover part power level interception straight defense daron ahead arizona edge perception head payer metric green chance washington aaron play net sack week,0.9862,0.0454476594455385,7.004873699851409,0.4726858789358787,0,2023-12-05

Washington Post,NCAA proposal would allow schools to pay their athletes directly,2023-12-05 15:07:00,Jesse Dougherty,"NCAA President Charlie Baker proposed a new economic model for college sports Tuesday morning, sending a letter to Division I schools that both laid out long-standing inequities and detailed his plan to address them. The crux of Baker’s proposal: to allow all Division I schools to compensate athletes directly through name, image and likeness (NIL) deals and remove the cap on education-related payments that athletes can receive. Baker also pitched a new subdivision within Division I that would allow well-resourced schools, should they opt into it, to form their own set of rules to better suit their investment in athletics.In the letter, acquired by The Washington Post, Baker was more comprehensive about the subdivision than about how school-funded NIL might look. Schools that opted into this still-hypothetical subdivision would have to invest a minimum of $30,000 per athlete per year into an “enhanced educational trust fund for at least half of the institution’s eligible student-athletes,” according to the proposal. The funds would be subject to Title IX rules that call for an equal distribution of resources between male and female athletes.While each school has a varying number of sports and athletes, an athletic department with 400 athletes would have to pay a minimum of $30,000 to at least 200 of them. That would start the entry fee to this subdivision for that school at $6 million. Schools in the subdivision could also enact their own policies separate from the rest of Division I addressing such things as NIL, scholarship limits and transfer rules.Baker wrote that all schools should be able to “offer student-athletes any level of enhanced educational benefits they deem appropriate.” The NCAA doesn’t plan to define how athletes could spend that money, though schools could choose to put parameters on it. The proposal also doesn’t require a school in the new subdivision to pay the same amount of money to each of the designated students, though there is the expectation of Title IX compliance. Schools could choose to pay more than half of their athletes through the fund, too.The upshot: Within the “framework of Title IX,” as Baker put it, schools could compensate athletes without restrictions (while also supplementing their trust fund earnings with NIL money).Another upshot, something that has been brewing for a while now: The proposed subdivision recognizes that not every school can operate the same way, priming the SEC, Big Ten, Big 12 and ACC — the new “Power Four” — to play under different rules from most other schools but remain under the NCAA umbrella.From here, the NCAA will work with its member schools to refine Baker’s proposal. How it could turn into policy was not immediately clear Tuesday, nor was how this might affect settlement discussions for major lawsuits and the NCAA’s discussions with lawmakers in Washington. Any passage is likely to require approval from the Division I board of directors.“The growing financial gap between the highest resourced colleges and universities and other schools in Division I has created a new series of challenges,” Baker wrote in the letter. “The challenges are competitive as well as financial and are complicated further by the intersection of name, image and likeness opportunities for student-athletes and the arrival of the Transfer Portal.”Why now? That’s a layered question.For starters, the NCAA is in the middle of several major lawsuits and National Labor Relations Board hearings that could drastically change the way it functions — and, in the House v. NCAA antitrust case, could end up with more than $4 billion in damages paid to a massive class of plaintiffs. While settlement talks continue in the House case, the NCAA lost a lot of leverage when the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 against it in NCAA v. Alston in 2021, which came right before the NCAA caved and permitted athletes to profit off their NIL.The NCAA’s ongoing lobbying efforts in Washington — to bar athletes from becoming employees and to receive an antitrust exemption to shield it from current and future litigation, among other goals — haven’t led to much traction, with 10 congressional hearings in the rearview without more than a few drafts. So here we are.“The courts and other public entities continue to debate reform measures that in many cases would seriously damage parts or all of college athletics,” Baker wrote, acknowledging that an uneven playing field calls for different sets of regulations.“Therefore, it is time for us — the NCAA — to offer our own forward-looking framework,” he continued. “This framework must sustain the best elements of the student-athlete experience for all student-athletes, build on the financial and organizational investments that have positively changed the trajectory of women’s sports, and enhance the athletic and academic experience for student-athletes who attend the highest resourced colleges and universities.”Again, as Baker notes at the end of that passage, this proposal foreshadows a break for the SEC, Big Ten, Big 12 and ACC from the rest of the pack. When realignment kicks in next year, Texas and Oklahoma will join the SEC; Oregon, UCLA, USC and Washington will join the Big Ten; Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah will join the Big 12; and SMU, California and Stanford will join the ACC. Television revenue is set to balloon some more.Realignment — coupled with 2½ years of NIL — has sparked constant discussion about whether schools should share revenue with their athletes and whether athletes should be considered employees of their schools and/or conferences. Baker’s proposal is the next step in that conversation, one that comes with a long list of questions about how the NCAA, the conferences and the schools would scale these proposals across the country:What could this mean for the donor-funded collectives that have been the key to NIL success for programs across Division I sports? What might it look like if a power conference school declines to join the proposed subdivision, therefore subjecting itself to different rules from teams it will regularly compete against? Will the major conferences attempt to require their member schools to join? Will schools cut sports to lower their number of athletes, lessening the minimum payment to join the subdivision?How will Title IX apply? Does it mean schools in the subdivision would have to have the same number of male and female athletes eligible for the payments that begin at $30,000 each or just make sure the total amount of money is distributed evenly?",6568,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/05/ncaa-economic-model-proposal/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,leverage deal rearview subdivision change national ongoing sec compete effort lose time pitch distribution complicate discussion rest subject compliance couple decline payment equal oklahoma fee designate employee enact damage title sport fund balloon comprehensive constant utah eligible deem refine athletic draft big pay remove public institution set question build affect litigation gap lot high university note accord element country drastically ix major separate starter academic upshot relation acc plaintiff send crux texas address california television receive experience college conversation restriction pack turn hearing plan require number limit usc talk kick passage compensate scale benefit exemption arrival continued acquire rule ncaa expectation future spend attempt department invest form offer billion athlete half male labor make ucla baker grow debate share clear cave colorado policy opportunity field propose long begin case lawmaker proposal financial scholarship entry goal define detailed directly likeness immediately board start choose framework million total vary competitive antitrust current success key realignment image consider break investment intersection attend series year state opt join stanford amount reform congressional entity massive parameter letter step program challenge laid oregon write sustain alston paid lessen house smu transfer nil approval measure low woman money team conference minimum positively trust resource uneven enhance organizational trajectory profit cut cap continue class different inequity lawsuit brewing female recognizes middle remain acknowledge settlement revenue collective regularly lobbying lead model morning function educational list create member suit apply earnings student traction part bar ten layer power permit level economic post athletics foreshadows supreme division spark arizona charlie call prim supplement court shield school distribute put washington resourced operate work play president evenly tuesday,0.9864,0.0456760048721071,10.665976627712856,0.3820847040627261,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,D.C. United’s technical director and director of scouting depart,2023-12-05 14:51:00,Steven Goff,"D.C. United’s front office continued to change Tuesday with the MLS club announcing the departures of technical director Stewart Mairs and director of scouting Sean Howe.The moves come amid evaluations of United’s operations by Ally Mackay, who two weeks ago was appointed general manager and chief soccer officer. Mackay, formerly Nashville SC’s assistant GM, succeeded Dave Kasper, United’s longtime executive who is now a senior consultant.“The club thanks both Stewart and Sean for their contributions and efforts during their time with the Black-and-Red and wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors,” United said in a statement. Club officials declined to comment.Mairs joined United in 2016 as director of soccer strategy and analysis before becoming the technical director in 2019. He worked closely with Kasper on roster decisions and the youth pathway to the first team.Howe spent three seasons with United after leaving a similar role with Atlanta. He was brought to Washington by Lucy Rushton, United’s general manager in 2021 and 2022. She was fired after the 2022 season and is now general manager of Bay FC, an NWSL expansion team based in San Jose.Mackay is expected to begin hiring additional staff in the coming weeks.His top priority, though, is conducting a search for a head coach to replace Wayne Rooney, who departed after the season. Mackay said last week that he is aiming to begin interviews this week and make an offer by Christmas.Potential candidates include former MLS head coaches Robin Fraser (Colorado), Giovanni Savarese (Portland), Bruce Arena (D.C., New York Red Bulls, Los Angeles Galaxy and New England) and Caleb Porter (Portland and Columbus).Also under consideration, according to a person familiar with the search, is Domènec Torrent, who guided New York City FC to MLS’s second-best regular season record in 2019.Since leaving NYCFC, the 61-year-old Spaniard has coached Brazil’s Flamengo and Turkey’s Galatasaray. Between 2007 and 2018, Torrent was a chief assistant to Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.According to another person familiar with the process, United might also consider Mark Warburton, who has coached Scotland’s Glasgow Rangers and England’s Brentford, Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers. Most recently, he was a West Ham assistant before departing last summer.",2368,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/05/dc-united-front-office-changes/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,youth top pep stewart portland assistant kasper staff guardiola change begin soccer replace leave scout similar contribution porter effort time wayne appoint club technical roster lucy domènec ranger mairs torrent decline united bay bayern pathway munich process columbus brazil additional robin galaxy savarese spaniard departure wish aim brentford operation consider amid mark rooney spent ago consideration join conduct galatasaray bruce atlanta nycfc park move giovanni hire succeed city ally analysis rushton regular ml official nashville dave accord sc forest nwsl expect glasgow office longtime team england manager announce fc statement front formerly arena recently candidate strategy manchester west york evaluation angeles include barcelona executive turkey closely interview bull endeavor season priority fire gm depart familiar expansion mackay role brought person scotland queen search guide record flamengo summer warburton chief base nottingham fraser general caleb luck continued future red head coached senior officer offer washington coach director work make decision tuesday san former week colorado,0.93705,0.0,10.832777777777778,0.3048972632305965,0,2023-12-05
CNN,CONMEBOL announces 14 host cities for 2024 Copa América as tournament returns to the US,2023-12-05 14:39:00,Matias Grez,"CONMEBOL, South America’s soccer federation, has announced the 14 cities that will host matches at the 2024 Copa América as the tournament returns to the United States for the first time since 2016.The 14 cities are Las Vegas (NV), Arlington (TX), Charlotte (NC), Orlando (FL), Miami Gardens (FL), Santa Clara (CA), Atlanta (GA), East Rutherford (NJ), Houston (TX), Austin (TX), Inglewood (CA), Glendale (AZ), Kansas City (KS) and Kansas City (MO).The tournament opener will be played at Atlanta United’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, with the final taking place at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium.It will be only the second time, after the special centenary Copa América in 2016, that the tournament has been hosted outside of South America.Ecuador was originally designated as the tournament host but pulled out in November 2022 due to economic and security concerns, as well as a lack of viable stadiums.That reportedly left just the US and Peru as the two nations willing to host the 2024 edition, with CONMEBOL and CONCACAF – the federation for North America, Central America and the Caribbean – jointly choosing the US in January of this year.Though the US unquestionably has better stadium infrastructure than any South American nation, the decision to once again host the tournament stateside led to some criticism in Latin America.“South America is having a hard time organizing its historic national team tournament,” Ezequiel Fernández Moores wrote in Argentine outlet La Nación in February.CONMEBOL has encountered obstacles in hosting the last three editions of the Copa América held in South America. In 2015, the host nation was changed from Brazil to Chile due to the former already hosting the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.Colombia was set to co-host the 2020 edition with Argentina, before it was postponed by a year due to the Covid pandemic. Protests across the country the following year led to Colombia withdrawing as co-host, with Argentina following suit soon after as the country grappled with high Covid cases.The tournament was eventually moved to Brazil and played behind closed doors.Now, for the third edition in a row, the host nation has been changed after the US took over organizing duties from Ecuador.However, Fernández Moores questioned why the same scrutiny, particularly around safety, isn’t applied to the United States.“It doesn’t matter that games can be played in California, the State that has just suffered four mass shootings in just 10 days in January,” Fernández Moores wrote.“For the third year in a row, the United States suffered more than six hundred mass shootings in 2022. In the first three weeks of 2023, there have already been 39 shootings.“It is unthinkable that CONMEBOL for its 2024 Copa América or FIFA for its 2026 World Cup would demand that the United States review its festival of naturalized violence, which kills in shopping malls, schools or on any street.”But hosting the 2024 Copa América is undoubtedly a huge boost for the USA as the country gears up to jointly host the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.In a country where soccer is still sometimes played in the shadows of the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, a successful tournament for the US Men’s National Team could play a huge role in boosting national interest ahead of 2026.The 2016 edition was an overwhelming success, too, registering a record average attendance of 46,000 and becoming the most lucrative Copa América to date, according to La Nación.Coupled with Lionel Messi’s arrival at Inter Miami, which has garnered worldwide attention and caused spikes in ticket sales and attendances, the 2024 Copa América could prove to be a perfect warm-up of sorts for both organizers and fans alike.Messi’s matches for Inter Miami have drawn star-studded crowds, while tickets – for both home and away games – are in huge demand, although the club has received criticism for hiking season ticket prices for next year and pricing out fans who had been loyal to the team prior to Messi’s arrival.It’s unclear whether Messi’s stateside adventure will boost soccer’s popularity in the US long-term, but perhaps few people will care as long as there is plenty of money to be made while he’s still in Miami.But the Argentine’s arrival hasn’t just boosted the coffers. His utterly dominant performances on the pitch – which have at times looked laughably easy – led Inter Miami to its first title in the club’s five-year history by helping the team win the Leagues Cup just months after joining.Such has been his influence in 2023 after guiding Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of 2022, Messi was named TIME’s Athlete of the Year on Tuesday.“At 36, two decades into his unparalleled career, Messi provided a singular stimulus to soccer in America. Attendance, ticket prices, merchandise sales, and viewership soared. His games took on the feel of a religious revival,” Sean Gregory wrote in TIME.“With the US hosting three major international tournaments in the next three years (Copa América in 2024, the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025, and the grandest of them all, the World Cup, in 2026), it’s sure to attract even more fans. But Messi is an accelerant.“With the most revered and influential athlete on the planet playing in Miami for at least the next two years, still performing at the top of his game – he won another Ballon d’Or as the world’s player of the year, his eighth, in late October – the US is now a soccer nation. A fútbol nation.”",5467,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/sport/copa-america-2024-host-cities-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205131426-01-copa-america-announcement-2024.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,obstacle violence laughably change national undoubtedly worldwide pandemic central popularity home unquestionably time charlotte pitch alongside average influence nation glendale register tx soar postpone designate successful security brazil january vega title particularly garner shooting rutherford north set question hard lucrative conmebol merchandise high game federation lack ticket accord country glory month perform played organizer naturalize fernández ezequiel announce major spike originally league concern pull nba easy south shopping close jointly peru miami season history provide stateside mall revere role review california return receive protest gear demand record dominant pricing away influential nc loyal messi follow viable crowd world houston matter usa day arrival perfect prior austin planet athlete make nhl cup former feel stimulus top lionel copa grandest sort long overwhelm due soccer suffer américa argentina safety mass date gregory player decade club fútbol price moore unclear boost united reportedly tournament choose career withdraw late orlando win international success kansa singular year ballon duty state interest atlanta infrastructure move concacaf opener rock america grapple mlb city write latin inglewood colombia east special money team october fl final mo huge performance fifa eighth place attention encounter unparalleled adventure row american plenty garden canada prove scrutiny nfl criticism argentine religious lead guide historic left edition eventually shadow suit apply held organize outlet hike festival coffer chile nj caribbean drawn economic viewership ahead inter clara hundred utterly november revival kill nv arlington unthinkable nación covid school centenary match stadium attract santa play decision host attendance week,0.99475,0.0548747027620267,9.067191011235952,0.4176971916971916,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Las Vegas-S. California high-speed rail gets $3 billion federal grant,2023-12-05 13:52:00,Luz Lazo,"Brightline, the only private intercity passenger railroad in the country, is getting a $3 billion federal grant to help build a $12 billion high-speed railway between Las Vegas and Southern California — an almost unheard of infusion of federal money for a private project that would help to put trains traveling at 186 mph on U.S. tracks by 2028.The grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation will help to advance the 218-mile route between Las Vegas and suburban Los Angeles, the two U.S. senators from Nevada announced Tuesday. The project, dubbed Brightline West, ranks at the top of U.S. projects that have boosted prospects for a domestic high-speed-rail system.Brightline has land, federal reviews and labor agreements in place, and company leaders say it could be built in four years. Its prospects are good, industry leaders and transportation officials say, amid renewed attention to rail in Washington and historic levels of federal funding for a national rail network that has lagged on the global stage.“Connecting Las Vegas and Southern California by high-speed rail will create tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs, boost our Southern Nevada tourism economy, and finally help us cut down on I-15 traffic,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) said in a statement.Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) said the project will be a “game changer” and called the federal aid critical to making it a reality.Brightline and the Nevada Department of Transportation submitted a 4,000-page application in April for a $3.75 billion federal grant from the federal infrastructure law. Although the award is short of the request, it is still one of the biggest infusions of federal funding into a privately developed transportation project in modern U.S. history, while it gives Brightline an important boost to break ground in the coming months.“We’re honored and humbled in the confidence President Biden, Secretary [Pete] Buttigieg, Senator Rosen and so many others have placed in Brightline’s vision to bring true high-speed rail to America,” Wes Edens, the founder and chairman of Brightline, said in a statement. “This is a historic moment that will serve as a foundation for a new industry, and a remarkable project that will serve as the blueprint for how we can repeat this model throughout the country.”In June, Brightline West received a $25 million federal grant to cover the design and construction of two stations in California.The federal grant announced Tuesday is intended to cover nearly one-third of the project’s cost, officials said, while the company would use private capital and tax-free debt known as private activity bonds to finance the rest. Company officials had said they needed the federal funding infusion to bring the project to construction.The 265-mile electrified rail link between Las Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga, where it would connect to downtown Los Angeles via commuter train, is estimated to cost $12 billion — three times the price envisioned in the mid-2000s. The concept for a Las Vegas-Southern California line dates to 2005, when Las Vegas developer Tony Marnell II pitched a bullet train to connect the city’s casinos with Victorville, 85 miles from downtown Los Angeles.Brightline’s 2018 acquisition of the project renewed hopes for the ailing line. The company has since secured land for four stations and the right of way in the median of Interstate 15 to build high-speed tracks.The rail line would take travelers along the median of the interstate between Las Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga in 2 hours and 10 minutes in trains traveling at up to 186 mph. Supporters say the system would remove about 3 million vehicles from the road, create 35,000 jobs and increase tourism between Nevada and California.Edens, the billionaire co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team and co-founder of Fortress Investment Group, which owns Brightline, said in an interview this summer that the project will be “the real embodiment of what high-speed rail can and should look like” in the United States and the first of many systems around the country. On Tuesday, he said the company is ready to get to work to bring “our vision of American-made, American-built, world-class, state-of-the-art high-speed train travel to America.”Brightline is aiming to time the opening of the line to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.Advocates of high-speed rail welcomed the news, calling the funding a transformational investment for the nation.“The tide has turned for high-speed rail in America,” said Andy Kunz, the president and chief executive of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association. He said the investment is a milestone to help make the United States competitive with 26 nations that have fast, clean and safe high-speed trains.Other high-speed projects in the works include a 500-mile system between Los Angeles and San Francisco that has been marred by delays and cost overruns. A 119-mile section is under construction, and projections call for a 171-mile segment connecting Merced, Fresno and Bakersfield to open between 2030 and 2033. Meanwhile, work is progressing on high-speed projects in the Pacific Northwest and in Texas, and Amtrak is eyeing its biggest expansion in 52 years.",5222,https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/12/05/brightline-west-high-speed-rail-grant/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,victorville increase brightline built national hour infusion segment time pitch andy group vehicle rest nation minute route debt traveler suburban transformational award vega global amtrak activity northwest fast big amid remove olympics railway honor build pacific system ready high developed passenger news mph game cost project design fortress country ground tide founder confidence train blueprint april traffic lag opening catherine announce statement bring west association angeles secure serve submit executive masto history progress aid texas mile review california connect receive envision finally marnell southern turn give foundation casino nevada rail milwaukee company union finance buck application travel railroad capital renew modern embodiment track kunz department rosen economy real ail billion safe leader electrify labor make privately san top job law supporter developer link jacky date agreement repeat price interstate transportation industry chairman boost cortez united commuter grant million advance concept competitive downtown remarkable fresno thousand intercity aim important private break investment humble federal station year state hope cover network infrastructure vision tony changer secretary america bakersfield intend city prospect construction official wes clean eye projection road money team acquisition francisco billionaire welcome cut line unheard include place attention interview open milestone basketball dubbed expansion speed model historic land rank biden create cucamonga domestic summer ten merced overrun tourism level chief median bond section delay senator call rancho funding june moment short request put washington critical bullet estimate buttigieg work president tuesday,0.99485,0.0574492531597089,11.582068965517236,0.4171705779600517,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Olympic sports leaders push IOC for a clear policy on Russian athletes,2023-12-05 13:00:00,Les Carpenter,"With less than eight months before the start of next summer’s Paris Olympics, a group of leaders from Olympic sports organizations said Tuesday that a decision about whether to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete needs to be made “as soon as possible.”The issue of what to do about Russia and ally Belarus has loomed over the Olympics since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began just days after the conclusion of the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. International Olympic Committee executives have tried to balance punishing Russia and Belarus for the attack while searching for a way to allow athletes from those countries to participate in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.Unraveling the issue was a priority at Tuesday’s summit meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, which included IOC President Thomas Bach, top IOC vice presidents, leaders of a handful of individual sports, anti-doping officials and a few heads of national sports federations, including the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee.Currently, the IOC is allowing each sport’s governing body to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete as what it calls “individual neutral athletes” if they have not been in the military or shown public support for the war. This has led to a patchwork of regulations, with track and field leaders banning Russian and Belarusian athletes entirely but gymnastics officials allowing them to participate as independent athletes starting in January.In October, the IOC suspended Russia’s Olympic committee as punishment for the country’s attempt to claim athletes from regions in Ukraine as their own.In a statement released after Tuesday’s summit, the IOC said the heads of the governing bodies for summer Olympic sports asked the IOC to declare eligible for the Paris Olympics the neutral athletes “who have qualified or will qualify on the field of play.” But at the same time, the group of summer sports leaders, including those from track and field, swimming and gymnastics, urged the IOC to “bring clarity” to the qualification procedures for the Russian and Belarusian athletes who will compete as neutrals.",2129,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2023/12/05/ioc-russia-paris-olympics/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,urge top declare ukraine ban russian field belarusian national begin punishment compete body attack participate winter time president group invasion thomas handful start meeting ioc bach patchwork vice release sport international neutral issue eligible claim independent public olympics clarity organization swim loom region committee ally russia game federation regulation official summit individual country procedure month support suspend october decide statement olympic bring paris beijing conclusion balance include paralympic executive priority belarus military qualify search lead summer govern punish switzerland qualification entirely day call track head attempt athlete lausanne leader make show decision gymnastics tuesday,-0.89805,0.0,12.124479999999998,0.2004629629629629,0,2023-12-05

CNN,NCAA president proposes new tier for ‘highest resourced’ schools to compensate athletes directly,2023-12-05 11:32:00,Jill Martin,"How NCAA athletes are compensated could be set to change. If it does, it would stem from a completely new approach by the NCAA.In a letter to NCAA Division I membership, NCAA president Charlie Baker is proposing to create a new subdivision within Division I – the highest level in collegiate athletics – for schools to directly compensate athletes.This would be a departure from previous practice. Baker, the former governor of Massachusetts who became NCAA president earlier this year, outlined a proposal for the “highest resourced” colleges and universities to invest in their athletes directly.This would include the use of athletes being able to profit from their name, image and likeness, commonly known as NIL.NIL deals stem from an NCAA policy change in 2021 that allowed athletes to profit from sponsorship opportunities –- a move that came after the US Supreme Court said that athletes could receive education-related payments in a case that reshaped the landscape of college sports.In the letter, which CNN obtained, Baker said moving in this direction “kick-starts a long-overdue conversation among the membership that focuses on the differences that exist between schools, conferences and divisions and how to create more permissive and flexible rules across the NCAA that put student-athletes first.”“Colleges and universities need to be more flexible, and the NCAA needs to be more flexible, too,” Baker said.The NCAA president said in the letter that any school that joins this newly created tier would be required to do two things.First, within the framework of Title IX, invest at least $30,000 per year into an enhanced educational trust fund for at least half of the institution’s eligible student-athletes.Second, committ to work with their peer institutions in this subdivision to create rules that may differ from the rules in place for the rest of Division I. Those rules could include a wide range of policies, such as scholarship commitment and roster size, recruitment, transfers or NIL.Baker said in the letter he looks forward to hearing from members and athletes as the NCAA moves ahead and encouraged members to provide feedback on the proposal.Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities – including athletics – that receive funding from the federal government and applies to schools and other educational institutions.",2397,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/sport/ncaa-new-tier-to-compensate-athletes-directly-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140926165012-jill-martin-profile-image.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,policy forward deal direction opportunity propose discrimination landscape change subdivision case proposal commonly scholarship commitment roster flexible rest membership basis directly likeness payment size framework title fund activity departure eligible image federal institution year cnn set join reshaped wide recruitment letter difference program move high focus exist transfer governor education applies committ conference ix trust enhance profit government sex permissive approach include place encourage completely provide differ feedback range massachusetts receive college conversation newly educational hearing former create member require prohibits stem level compensate athletics supreme division ahead earlier outline rule charlie ncaa tier previous funding obtain collegiate invest court peer school put athlete half resourced sponsorship work baker president practice university,0.9773,0.0,12.880975609756096,0.3871572871572872,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,"Despite the new-age screeching, Alabama vs. Florida State is an age-old debate",2023-12-05 10:31:00,Chuck Culpepper,"The committee has committed a monstrous sin. It has been found guilty of diligence.Its sleepless weighing of a merciless puzzle that led it to peg Alabama (12-1) ahead of Florida State (13-0) for a four-team playoff guaranteed that it, the 13-member College Football Playoff selection committee, would spend Sunday afternoon and evening importing spite, vitriol and harebrained charges of corruption. Knees jerked into outrage across the land until you would almost think our national culture has some sort of tendency to make shrieking profitable.Forgive the pleas and cries of Florida State players and coaches and devoted fans, even Coach Mike Norvell’s detour into twaddle — “What is the point of playing the games?” — which is the type of dubious line we’ve all spat out in times of searing disappointment. They’re all in love, which has its beauty even as people in love can come up shy of objectivity on issues concerning those with whom they’re in love.Focus instead on others, especially those whose thoughtlessness traveled via screeching. The idea that any unbeaten conference champion such as Florida State in 2023 should get the automatic nod into any playoff or championship regardless of whom it beat or who’s in contention around it is, to quote the late Molly Ivins, horsepucky. Conditions vary from year to year — who knew? — and this year loosed on the committee an indecipherable cluster of contenders. It triggered an old brainteaser in our daffiest sport: the team with the superior schedule and one loss vs. the team with the inferior schedule and zero losses.Luckily, we have the groaning annals of the 154 years of college football, where there’s always an old season to help us realize again how the current system is the best to date.Hell, there are always 10 such seasons, but let’s revisit the inexact parallel of 1984-85.That season went amok with parity until everybody in Division I except Brigham Young lost at least once. (Cal State Fullerton went 11-1 on the fields but 12-0 retroactively after learning in March 1985 that its lone conqueror, UNLV, had dipped into the nation’s eternal stash of ineligible players.) BYU finished 13-0. It won an early game at No. 3 Pittsburgh, which proceeded to careen from there to 3-7-1. BYU played the nation’s 89th-best schedule, zapped mostly Western Athletic Conference foes (none of which lost fewer than four games) and took the Holiday Bowl way before New Year’s Day on Dec. 21 by 24-17 with a rally against Michigan (6-6), after which the great Peter Richmond of the Miami Herald wrote, “The margin was large enough for a victory, but it may have been too small for a national championship.”To clear up matters, Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler fielded a question about whether, to his keen eye, BYU would be a true national champion.“I don’t know if they are or not,” he said.Thanks, Coach.Beneath BYU, Washington finished 11-1. It went early to Ann Arbor, Mich., and depressed most of the mere 103,072 in attendance by 20-11, and it closed late in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 1, 1985, against then-No. 2 Oklahoma, by 28-17. Along the way it lost at Southern California, which people have done often through time if less so nowadays. Its coach, Don James, who would win half a national championship in 1991-92, had an anonymous mentee already coaching defensive backs at Michigan State: Nick Saban. “Washington is the best team we played, and they deserve to be number one,” Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer said. “They’re a better team than Brigham Young, I guarantee you.”The nation bickered over the unknowable, which does sound familiar. It decided champions back then by polls, the last of which had BYU at No. 1 with 38 first-place votes, Washington at No. 2 with 16 and Florida (9-1-1) at No. 3 with six. “I’m glad it’s over with,” BYU Coach LaVell Edwards said, speaking of the “draining” nature of having to coach his team on fields and defend it on TVs. The issue got a good overview from James himself, who told the Associated Press: “If you pick the best record, you can’t argue with BYU. But if you pick the best team, I think that’s us.”“Who’s No. 1?” Bob Oates of the Los Angeles Times asked. “This would have been a good year for college football to have answered that question with a playoff system.”Oates recommended four teams.That would clear up matters, as everyone knew at the time.Yeah.Almost four full bumpy decades later, with many murky years in between, here came Florida State (13-0) or Alabama (12-1), the latest in the many cases of James’s old question: best team or best season? Only now the country had a four-team playoff and a committee doing something the country used to be crummy at doing: valuing strengths of schedule. Committee members have strained to answer the two key questions for trying to rank teams in a 133-team sport without much head-to-head availability:Whom did you beat?Where did you beat them?They knew Florida State had a strong case even while lacking injured quarterback Jordan Travis. They knew Alabama had a strong case whether Florida State had Travis or not. They knew of the gap between the two schedules, certainly narrower than that between BYU and Washington but 50 places nonetheless (with Alabama fifth and Florida State 55th). They knew each team had a fortunate win on the road, Florida State’s at Clemson that hinged on a missed 30-yard field goal with two minutes left and Alabama’s at Auburn that hinged on your everyday fourth-and-31 pass with 32 seconds left.Could Alabama’s schedule get a nose past Florida State’s spotlessness? By Saturday morning, it probably couldn’t: Florida State had beaten teams ultimately ranked Nos. 13 and 22; Alabama, teams at Nos. 11, 13 and 21. By Sunday morning, maybe it could: Florida State added a victim ranked No. 15 but Alabama a victim that the Crimson Tide had toppled from No. 1 to No. 6. Was Alabama’s loss disqualifying? Not really; it came against No. 3. The details were many. The increments were tiny, a fact always getting lost. A move from No. 8 to No. 4 (like Alabama) or from No. 7 to No. 3 (like Texas) just isn’t all that drastic.",6128,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/05/college-football-playoff-difficult-choice/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,stash cluster careen unknowable national spotlessness spite brigham march found lose time conqueror charge herald saturday nation minute oklahoma eternal defensive twaddle groan sport shy contender issue afternoon oates nod molly tendency athletic plea overview cal love argue question beaten system committee gap beauty switzer clemson game fortunate lack parallel depressed sear unlv norvell recommend country tide strength played miss ultimately zero concern quote anonymous knew barry nick close inexact ranked associate angeles full bowl vote miami season beat texas probably inferior commit lavell california guarantee everyday past football college retroactively southern spat record topple nose deserve disappointment instead finish shriek culture number jerked peg harebrained guilty poll small tv matter travel day contention jordan travis spend point pick james large indecipherable half coach parity zapped make michigan rally holiday nonetheless clear import field championship ineligible sort answer revisit case murky alabama daffiest weigh player schedule hinge brainteaser decade playoff merciless sleepless goal quarterback dipped screech mentee fact late narrower victory vitriol vary margin current win key drain loss type told year state superior crummy strain mike move guaranteed write auburn nature florida availability champion back detail eye outrage value dubious road loose amok team conference victim condition decide keen ann monstrous annals drastic line orange early pittsburgh great defend horsepucky glad fullerton sound place unbeaten saban strong idea crimson trigger familiar bumpy automatic foe realize proceed detour schembechler disqualify selection ivins lead morning land especially left rank lone objectivity member injured edward learn press bob knee western byu bicker division ahead corruption arbor nowadays richmond sunday devote thoughtlessness cry young increment washington add speak play attendance puzzle tiny,0.95585,0.0489556135770234,6.756161776367961,0.45633608815427,0,2023-12-05
CNN,Cincinnati Bengals win overtime thriller against Jacksonville Jaguars; Trevor Lawrence leaves game with ankle injury,2023-12-05 09:30:00,Ben Morse,"The Cincinnati Bengals stunned the Jacksonville Jaguars in an overtime thriller, 34-31, on Monday, while Jags star quarterback Trevor Lawrence limped off with an ankle injury.The Bengals – led by backup quarterback Jake Browning after Joe Burrow suffered a season-ending wrist injury in Week 11 – conjured up a 12-play, 42-yard drive which culminated in a 48-yard Evan McPherson field goal to claim the win in overtime.Browning impressed in his second career start, going 32-of-37 on his passing attempts for 354 yards and a touchdown – a 76-yard connection to Ja’Marr Chase in the third quarter – and a rushing score.The former undrafted quarterback from the University of Washington was able to move the ball against a Jacksonville team who has high hopes this season after a deep postseason run last year.But expectations might have been dealt a serious blow after Lawrence had to be helped off the field after appearing to suffer a painful ankle injury late in the fourth quarter of Monday’s game.Lawrence, who had thrown for 258 yards and two touchdowns before the injury, was stepped on by Jacksonville offensive lineman Walker Little as he dropped back to make a pass with the scores tied at 28-28 and the Jaguars driving for what would have been a go-ahead touchdown. The 24-year-old then bent backward awkwardly while on the ground and could be seen in pain afterwards.He attempted to make his way off the field under his own power but stumbled to the turf before slamming his fists and helmet into the ground in apparent frustration. He was helped towards the sideline by two athletic trainers.In the aftermath of Monday’s defeat, NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe reported that Lawrence seemed able to stand on his ankle in the locker room “but was careful not to put pressure or walk on it.” Lawrence was later seen departing the locker room in a walking boot.According to NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero, Lawrence suffered what was initially diagnosed as an ankle sprain and will undergo an MRI on Tuesday.“It’s just a right high ankle sprain, everything’s stable, everything’s good,” Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson said on Tuesday.“We’ll see where he is here in a couple of days.”Pederson put the emphasis of the loss though on his team’s inability to stop the Bengals running game.“That’s the strength of our defense, is stopping the run. We just didn’t do that. We failed there,” he told reporters. “We got too many explosive plays we gave up.“Obviously, offensively when you can’t run the ball, then when the running game for them is going, you see what happens, right? That’s where the explosiveness comes from. We had moments on offense where we got some explosives. Their’s all stem from being able to run the ball successfully.”The defeat and Lawrence’s injury could deal a damaging blow to Jacksonville’s playoff hopes this season.The Jags remain atop the AFC South with their 8-4 record, but if Lawrence misses a prolonged amount of time and with the Indianapolis Colts breathing down their neck at 7-5, it could be a season-defining few weeks for the Florida team.For the Bengals on the other hand, it was an evening of hope following a dark few weeks following Burrow’s injury.Browning’s excellent performance, with Burrow watching on from the sideline with his arm in a sling, gives the fans something to root for with a playoff push unlikely with the team sitting at 6-6 and last in the AFC North.Afterwards, Bengals head coach Zac Taylor described Browning’s display as “awesome” and “outstanding.”“He had a great week of practice. I thought Thursday was outstanding and that’s really our big day, third-down day. I felt really good coming out this week, getting ready for this game. He just lit the world on fire,” Taylor told reporters.“Halftime, I wasn’t sure if we had an incompletion, if the ball hit the ground yet. Thought he managed the game well. He was aggressive with some of his throws. Did a great job making plays with his feet.”Taylor added: “So just really proud of Jake and the job he did, and the guys rallying around him making plays for him, protecting him, run game getting going. It all helped Jake. Really proud of the team win, but really proud of Jake. In his second career start to come out here on Monday Night Football to do what he did is pretty cool.”",4307,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/sport/cincinnati-bengals-jacksonville-jaguars-trevor-lawrence-nfl-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205094209-jake-browning-extra.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,apparent aftermath deal limp blow burrow cincinnati time fail couple defeat arm postseason incompletion felt deep undergo star mcpherson damage athletic offensively big claim rush emphasis outstanding culminate run ready throw high zac lineman game yard careful ground bent report strength miss cameron fist guy south excellent thrown mri jacksonville breathing season backup thursday proud football stop explosive overtime touchdown marr give record tie push pelissero pederson root fourth follow stumble world thriller day expectation jake hit bengal quarter attempt lit wolfe connection coach jaguar conjure make explosiveness rally practice former drive job impressed field neck painful suffer stand turf playoff night goal awesome trevor monday quarterback described start career aggressive ankle ball late display walker win doug pain cool prolong lawrence room loss walk offense told hope hand network amount step move afc inability offensive florida wrist back pretty stable indianapolis team tom dark diagnose performance passing chase awkwardly colt sideline great frustration undrafted browning reporter sling fire manage depart backward score remain nfl slam lead watch taylor helmet joe drop protect injury stem power defense halftime stun atop initially insider locker head moment put washington sprain add pressure play dealt evan week university,0.5947,0.2089621546319943,8.211522248243561,0.4980826404635928,0,2023-12-05

The chain crew operated with one fewer member for the rest of the game.The Saints said that Piazza had undergone an MRI on Monday and was seen to by an orthopedic doctor. He was found to have suffered a fractured fibula and a dislocated knee but his “blood vessels remain intact” and would have surgery likely next week.“He appreciates the many well wishes and the continued care he continues to receive,” the Saints said.",1321,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/sport/nfl-official-horror-injury-saints-lions-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205100420-02-kamara-nfl-injury.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,collision doctor announce staff field medical cut intact sideline nick close suffer blood continue mri found fell lion monday vessel rest leg remain minute fibula nfl stop stretch receive clutch tasked dislocate member kamara pain distance wish part knee awkward hospital alvin crew travel run fracture continued result camera sunday caesar move saint detroit angle tackle quarter superdome surgery game shout appreciates undergone official back orleans measure piazza operate collide ground involve show fall bent team attend orthopedic chain,-0.03105,0.0,9.94048780487805,0.3562770562770562,0,2023-12-05

CNN,"New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh declines to name a starting QB for Week 14, denies that Zach Wilson is hesitant to play",2023-12-05 06:59:00,not specified,"Robert Saleh, head coach of the New York Jets, was non-committal when asked about who would start at quarterback for his team’s Week 14 game against the Houston Texans on Sunday.The Jets traded for Aaron Rodgers during the offseason, but suffered a major blow when the four-time MVP went down with a significant Achilles injury just four snaps into his career in New Jersey.Third-year signal-caller and former No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson was named the starter going forward and he experienced some initial success, leading Gang Green to a 4-3 start and upsetting the Philadelphia Eagles along the way, but the Jets offense soon stagnated and struggled to move the football.From Week 8 to Week 11, the Jets went on a run of 13 straight quarters without a touchdown. That embarrassing streak was snapped against the Buffalo Bills, but Saleh had seen enough by this point and benched Wilson in the third quarter of the 32-6 loss at Highmark Stadium.Life with Boyle at the helm hasn’t been much better for the New York offense, with the team losing their two games with the 29-year-old as the starter. Boyle was then benched for Trevor Siemian in a Week 13 defeat to the Atlanta Falcons as the quarterback crisis deepened.Saleh was asked on Monday about who would be starting as quarterback against the Texans, to which he replied: “No, I’m still not there yet.”He also denied reports that Wilson is reluctant to retake the starting position after being benched earlier in the season.“Let’s be clear, if [Wilson] was reluctant to play, he wouldn’t be here,” Saleh said. “I actually coincidentally just got done speaking with him. He came in about a half hour ago and we had a really good conversation.“The young man wants the ball. He wants to start. He believes he’s the best quarterback in the room and the best quarterback for this team and the guy who gives us the best chance to win.”Wilson has been sacked 38 times this season, per StatMuse, despite only playing in 10 games, and risk of injury under that physical duress is reportedly the reason that he is hesitant to return, something which Saleh said he empathizes with.“We’re in a society now where kids miss Bowl games because they’re worried about their draft status, right?” said Saleh. “So empathetically, if that discussion had been had somewhere, and again it wasn’t with me, but if that conversation was had and it somehow leaked out to the media, I don’t think that’s indicative of his mindset. The kid wants to play.”Seeking their first postseason berth since 2010, the Jets were given a glimmer of hope on Wednesday when Rodgers was cleared to practice, despite the initial expectation that he would be out for the remainder of the season.However, it is still unclear when the 40-year-old will be able to return to the stadium field.“This isn’t so much getting ready to play as much as it is a progression in his rehab,” Saleh told the media last Wednesday.Even if Rodgers does make a miraculous comeback, it is unlikely to dig the team out of the hole that the Jets are currently in. New York sits at 4-8 on the season having lost five straight games and remain firmly on the outside of the playoff picture.",3178,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/sport/ny-jets-zach-wilson-robert-saleh-nfl-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205111013-01-new-york-jets-qb.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,forward berth reason blow texan rodgers status suffer hour firmly boyle lose time progression playoff trevor monday quarterback worried discussion unclear eagle defeat highmark siemian reportedly postseason start streak empathetically embarrass career initial indicative ball upset believe snap success picture draft kid loss room offense saleh told gang struggle experienced ago hope run atlanta robert move ready jet zach game physical trade despite rehab report position team society miss crisis major guy hesitant seek starter york bill sits mindset significant risk deny bowl season currently remain wednesday practice return statmuse lead touchdown conversation offseason empathizes helm glimmer give injury miraculous leak comeback medium philadelphia coincidentally wilson straight reluctant houston earlier achilles falcon expectation mvp point quarter head pick bench young duress reply green hole chance remainder stagnate half aaron coach speak stadium retake make buffalo play sack former week clear,-0.85345,0.0943989930774071,7.99389937106918,0.3273540879923859,0,2023-12-05

A wrestler who is pinned, taps out or commits a disqualification goes into a penalty box for 90 seconds. Should there be a tie at the end, the remaining wrestlers go into a sudden death overtime.

CNN,International Ice Hockey Federation mandates neck guards to be worn at all levels following Adam Johnson’s death,2023-12-05 06:07:00,Matias Grez,"The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) has announced that neck guards will be mandatory at all levels, including the Winter Olympics and World Championships, following Adam Johnson’s death.Johnson died after sustaining a cut to the neck in a collision with another player during the second period of the Nottingham Panthers’ game against the Sheffield Steelers in England on October 28.A Sheffield coroner’s report found that the 29-year-old “sustained an incised wound to the neck caused by the skate of another player” and later died in hospital as a result of the injury.In a statement released on Monday, the IIHF said it has taken the decision “on recommendation from its Medical Committee.”“The neck laceration protectors are now mandatory for the senior categories in addition to the U20 and U18 categories, for which neck laceration protectors had already been enforced as per IIHF Official Rule Book,” the statement read.“The exact date this mandate will go into effect for the senior categories will be determined by the supply situation. The IIHF remains in close contact with its suppliers to ensure they are able to respond to the current high demand.”The IIHF added that it “continues to strongly recommend” that neck guards are worn by all players competing in IIHF competitions until the date of the mandate is decided.It follows the decision of both the English Ice Hockey Association and the Canadian Hockey League making neck guards mandatory in their competitions.In the NHL, neck guards – let alone neck coverings of any kind – are not a common sight, but the Pittsburgh Penguins, Johnson’s former NHL team, are mandating neck guards for their minor league players.",1694,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/sport/iihf-neck-guards-adam-johnson-death-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231109120126-02-nhl-neckguards-cnn-sport.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,collision championship neck sheffield medical player date compete found winter monday respond competition situation iihf contact remains release supplier current international book determine olympics effect johnson incise high sustain game federation coroner official kind english recommend minor report team october england protector announce statement league skate common cut steelers association worn close ensure pittsburgh continue guard include exact enforce laceration period canadian supply former ice recommendation mandate level sight hockey covering follow nottingham hospital world result panther rule strongly mandatory wound penguin senior adam add addition make decision nhl category,0.3695,0.0,11.439475409836064,0.2905208333333333,0,2023-12-05
ABC,"Tokyo Olympics sullied by bid-rigging, bribery trials more than 2 years after the Games closed",2023-12-05 01:48:00,STEPHEN WADE Associated Press and YURI KAGEYAMA Associated Press,"TOKYO -- The bid-rigging trial around the Tokyo Olympics played out Tuesday in a Japanese courtroom — more than two years after the Games closed — with advertising giant Dentsu and five other companies facing criminal charges.Seven individuals are also facing charges from Tokyo district prosecutors in the cases, including Koji Henmi, who oversaw the sports division at Dentsu at the time.Executives or management-level officials at each of the accused companies, and Tokyo Olympic organizing committee official Yasuo Mori, have been charged with violating anti-monopoly laws.Among the companies facing charges are Dentsu Group, Hakuhodo, Tokyu Agency and event organizer Cerespo. All deal with event organizing, sports promotion or marketing.Dentsu has a long history of lining up sponsorships and advertising with bodies like World Athletics, headed by Sebastian Coe, and the Switzerland-based International Olympic Committee, led by Thomas Bach.Genta Yoshino, the lawyer for Henmi, did not deny the bid-rigging took place. Speaking in Tokyo district court, he said no bid process was ever decided upon or set up by the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee.“Even if what happened gets categorized as bid-rigging, all my client did was abide by the organizing committee's intentions, following their instructions,” Yoshino told the court, presided over by a panel of three judges.Yoshino said his client merely did his best to make the Olympics a success. Henmi was under pressure from the IOC, which repeatedly expressed doubts about the ability of the Tokyo organizers, Yoshino added.The organizing committee was headed at the time by Yoshiro Mori, a former Japanese prime minister who was eventually forced to resign as the head of Tokyo 2020. The CEO was Toshiro Muto, a former deputy director of the Bank of Japan.The maximum penalty for a company convicted of bid-rigging is a fine of up to 500 million yen ($3.3 million). An individual, if found guilty, faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 5 million yen ($33,000).Trials take months in Japan, sometimes years. The next session in the trial was scheduled for Jan. 15, 2024. It's unclear when a verdict may come.Dentsu was a key force in landing the Olympics for Tokyo in 2013. French prosecutors have looked into allegations that IOC members may have been bribed to vote for Tokyo.Once the Olympics landed in Tokyo, Dentsu became the chief marketing arm of the Games and raised a record $3.3 billion in local sponsorship. Dentsu received a commission on the sales — sales that were at least twice as large as any previous Olympics.The reports of corruption surrounding Dentsu also forced the resignation in 2019 of Tsunekazu Takeda, the head of the Japanese Olympic Committee and an IOC member who headed Olympic marketing.Tokyo organizers say they spent $13 billion to organize the 2020 Olympics, which were delayed a year by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a government audit suggests the expenditure might have been twice that. At least 60% was public money.The Tokyo scandal ruined the chances of the northern city of Sapporo of landing the 2030 Winter Olympics. It had been a strong favorite but was forced to withdraw. The IOC last week said it favored a French Alps bid for the 2030 Games with Salt Lake City the preferred choice for 2034.Earlier this year French police searched the headquarters of the 2024 Paris Olympics in an investigation over contracts linked to the Games.In the wake of the scandal, Dentsu has been restricted from bidding on contracts for the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and by the city of Osaka and the local prefecture, which is hosting the 2025 World Exposition.Tokyo prosecutors have also been investigating a separate bribery scandal centered around Haruyuki Takahashi, a former Dentsu executive. Takahashi was a member of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee and wielded powerful influence over the Olympic business.Takahashi's trial opens Dec. 14. He has not publicly acknowledged guilt, or made any statement, and speculation is rife he will fight the charges.The scandal involving Takahashi involves bribery allegations over Olympic sponsorships that were won by companies such as Aoki Holdings, a clothing company that dressed Japan’s Olympic team, and Sun Arrow, which produced the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic mascots.Some company officials have already been convicted, but did not receive jail time. Almost all criminal trials in Japan result in guilty verdicts. The defense, including Henmi's, is trying to salvage the client's reputation and minimize any fines.___",4588,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/tokyo-olympics-sullied-bid-rigging-bribery-trials-2-105379414,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c080d46d-c206-4f06-a691-684fff32a220/wirestory_01e43ca5aced60fc842c2c02b6375527_16x9.jpg?w=992,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,favorite ability report suggests decide penalty link bribed company toshiro clothing koji week large criminal team client convict deal division powerful athletics make osaka audit winter expenditure express reputation previous salt japanese instruction courtroom organizer chance prefecture northern restrict agency takahashi receive individual yen tsunekazu lake official promotion tuesday violate paris speculation yoshino mori million investigation guilty speak wake set accuse session long corruption surround executive bribery wield member maximum played force giant group police prime sport land jail metropolitan haruyuki arm repeatedly contract yasuo bid found deny japan lawyer involves verdict process dress muto key takeda world defense follow coe scandal told pressure panel billion statement host deputy game vote henmi happen guilt bidding paralympic result advertising preside resignation fine categorize produce former favor schedule tokyo time history public influence delayed ceo international arrow alp district head center strong ioc eventually bank spent charge dentsu record yoshiro local ruin olympics hakuhodo prefer involve rife choice trial open sapporo resign month minister allegation prosecutor event city place salvage chief separate search prison case headquarters line unclear intention aoki year court publicly acknowledge marketing raise sebastian holding close oversaw director committee french pandemic organize body include government thomas commission fight lead success sun olympic tokyu investigate abide sponsorship cerespo minimize doubt withdraw,-0.967,0.0,11.865236907730669,0.3234802431610942,0,2023-12-05

USA TODAY,"2023 Heisman Trophy finalists announced, with three of four being quarterbacks",2023-12-05 00:03:57,Scooby Axson,"The ceremony for the Heisman Memorial Trophy is going to be a quarterback party once again. LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels, Ohio State wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., Oregon quarterback Bo Nix and Washington quarterback Michael Penix, Jr. were named finalists for the Heisman Trophy on Monday. The Heisman Trophy is ""annually awarded to the most outstanding college football player in the United States, whose performance epitomizes great ability combined with diligence, perseverance, and hard work."" The winner will be announced during a live telecast Saturday from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City starting at 8 p.m. ET on ESPN. The award presentation ceremony invitee list is capped at four finalists. This century, 19 of the 22 Heismans awarded have gone to quarterbacks, including last year when Southern California quarterback Caleb Williams won. Each of the quarterback finalists in 2023 has played at least five seasons and are transfers from previous schools. The 2023 vote figures to be closer than in previous years and might challenge the 2009 results when Alabama’s Mark Ingram beat Stanford’s Toby Gerhart by just 28 votes. Jayden Daniels, senior quarterback, LSU San Bernardino, California 6-4, 210 2023 stats: 72.2%, 3,812 yards, 40 TD, 4 INT; 1,134 rushing yards, 10 TD Daniels, who spent his first three seasons at Arizona State, became the first player in FBS history to throw for 350 yards and rush for over 200 yards in a single game, accomplishing the feat against Florida. Daniels leads the nation in quarterback rating and yards per passing attempt and is seeking to become LSU’s first Heisman winner since Joe Burrow won in 2019. --- Marvin Harrison Jr., junior wide receiver, Ohio State Philadelphia 6-4, 205 2023 stats: 67 receptions, 1,211 yards (18.1 average per catch), 15 total touchdowns (14 receiving, 1 rushing) Harrison, son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison, is a Bilentikoff Award finalist for the second season in a row. Harrison led the Big Ten in receiving yards, yards per reception, and touchdown catches. Harrison is seeking to become Ohio State's first Heisman winner since Troy Smith won it in 2006. --- Bo Nix, senior quarterback, Oregon Pinson, Alabama 6-2, 217 2023 stats: 77.2%, 4,145 yards, 40 TD, 3 INT; 228 rushing yards, 6 TD Nix, in his second season after transferring from Auburn, had an outstanding 2023 for the Ducks, leading the nation in completions, and completion percentage, while tied for the lead in touchdown passes with Daniels. In his last five games, Nix threw 19 touchdowns with only two interceptions, leading Oregon to the Pac-12 title game. Oregon’s last Heisman winner was Marcus Mariota in 2014. --- Michael Penix, Jr., senior quarterback, Washington Tampa, Florida 6-3, 213 2023 stats: 65.7%, 4,218 yards, 33 TD, 9 INT Another impact transfer, Penix, Jr., who bolted Indiana for Seattle in 2022, helped the Huskies complete an undefeated regular season with a victory over Oregon in the Pac-12 championship. Penix, who finished eighth in the Heisman voting last year, led the nation in passing yards and passing yards per game while throwing 33 touchdowns. No Washington player has ever won the Heisman and the last top-10 vote-getter was Jake Browning, who finished sixth in 2016. Odds information provided by BetMGM.

USA TODAY,Bengals-Jaguars Monday Night Football highlights: Cincy wins in OT; Trevor Lawrence hurt,2023-12-04 23:39:52,"Tyler Dragon, Victoria Hernandez, Jim Reineking","The Cincinnati Bengals (6-6) didn’t need Joe Burrow to upset the Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4) when they did so, 34-31, in overtime in a Monday night game where Trevor Lawrence was hurt. Evan McPherson hit a 48-yard field goal at EverBank Stadium to give quarterback Jake Browning his first NFL win. Browning went 32-of-37 for 354 yards and a 76-yard touchdown to Ja’Marr Chase in the third quarter. He found the star receiver again in overtime to help march the Bengals down the field for McPherson’s game-winning kick. Chase finished with 11 catches for 149 yards. Tee Higgins had three catches for 36 yards in his return from a hamstring injury. Cincinnati had 156 rushing yards led by Joe Mixon who had 19 carries for 68 yards and two touchdowns. The win comes after Browning’s first start last week, a 16-10 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. “I really think it started up front, we were able to run the ball really well and really efficiently,” Browning said on the ESPN broadcast after the game. “… Then I think just having a week under my belt was huge. I think that’s really, that’s not a fancy answer, but that’s really I think what it was.” Lawrence was injured in the fourth quarter when he was sacked and offensive lineman Walker Little stepped on his right ankle. The quarterback shuffled off the field and went to the X-ray room after going 22-of-29 for 258 yards and two touchdowns. C.J. Beathard filled in for him, but couldn’t power Jacksonville to a victory that would have put them at the front of the AFC standings. Christian Kirk suffered a groin injury on Jacksonville’s first offensive play of the game. He did not return. His absence opened the door for rookie Parker Washington, who had six catches for 61 yards and his first career touchdown. Brandon McManus sent the game into overtime with a 40-yard field goal after missing a 48-yard attempt earlier in the fourth quarter. There were five ties in the game, the most in a game so far this season, per the ESPN broadcast. “It feels good, definitely had to earn it, I needed even some overtime to get it done,” Browning said. “… It’s been a long time since I won a game, so it feels good.” — Victoria Hernandez Jake Browning threw for 354 yards and a touchdown in his second career start, and the Bengals stunned the Jaguars in overtime. Jake Browning: The undrafted quarterback out of Washington got his first career NFL win, doing so impressively, delivering the Bengals' first win on ""Monday Night Football"" since 1990. Browning completed 32 of 37 passes for 354 yards and a touchdown for a passer rating of 115.5. It was just Browning's second career NFL start. Ja'Marr Chase: Browning had some help in his breakthrough performance. The Bengals receiver — who goes by ""7-Eleven"" because he claims to always be open — gathered in 11 of Browning's 12 targets for 149 yards, including a 76-yard touchdown play. Top AFC contenders: The Jaguars had an opportunity to move into the top spot in the AFC with a win, and in the driver's seat for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Jacksonville's loss keeps the Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens — each 9-3 — atop the AFC as the Jaguars dropped into a tie with the Kansas City Chiefs at 8-4. The Jaguars face the Ravens in Week 15 on ""Sunday Night Football"" in what will be a huge game for the AFC playoff picture, but might have to face one of the NFL's top teams without Trevor Lawrence. Jaguars' Super Bowl hopes: With an opportunity to control their path toward home-field advantage in the AFC playoffs ahead of them, the Jaguars were bested by a backup quarterback on their home field. Now, the Jaguars — one of four NFL teams to have never appeared in a Super Bowl — might have to hold off the upstart Houston Texans (7-5) and surprising Gardner Minshew-led Indianapolis Colts (7-5) to win the division. Quarterbacks: Lawrence's ankle injury is just the latest in a long line of injuries suffered by starting quarterbacks this season, joining Aaron Rodgers (Achilles), Kirk Cousins (Achilles), Deshaun Watson (shoulder), Anthony Richardson (shoulder), Joe Burrow (wrist), Daniel Jones (knee) and Kenny Pickett (ankle). — Jim Reineking With less than two minutes remaining in overtime, Evan McPherson made winners of the Jake Browning-led Bengals, nailing a 48-yard field goal to win the game. Browning helped guide the Bengals into field-goal range with a 12-play, 42-yard drive to get the ball to the Jaguars' 30-yard line. The big play of the drive was a juggling 17-yard catch by Ja'Marr Chase that got the ball near midfield. Tee Higgins added an 11-yard catch on the drive. — Jim Reineking The Jaguars missed their opportunity to close out the game on the first possession of overtime. Calvin Ridley snagged an impressive 43-yard catch from C.J. Beathard that would have put them at the Cincinnati 2-yard line, but a holding call brought the ball back. The Bengals defense forced fourth-and-21 and the Jaguars punted. — Victoria Hernandez The Jaguars and Bengals are headed to overtime with the game tied at 31 at the end of regulation. Brandon McManus kicked a 40-yard field goal to even the score with 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Bengals attempted to march down the field and had some momentum with an 18-yard rush from Joe Mixon, but Jake Browning couldn’t get Cincinnati far enough for Evan McPherson to attempt a game-winning kick. Jacksonville won the coin toss and will receive the kick. They are without quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who is out with an ankle injury. — Victoria Hernandez The Jaguars and Bengals are most likely headed to overtime as Brandon McManus kicked a 40-yard field goal. C.J. Beathard took over at quarterback for an injured Trevor Lawrence and was sacked twice, forcing the kick attempt. — Victoria Hernandez The Bengals did what the Jaguars could not do and nailed a 54-yard field goal to go ahead 31-28 with 2:28 left in the game. On fourth-and-14, Evan McPherson lined up for the kick and sent it in to take the lead. The drive featured a 21-yard run from Jake Browning, two false start penalties on Cincinnati and a sack by Josh Allen, who has 1.5 and an interception on the day. — Victoria Hernandez Trevor Lawrence hurt his leg in the fourth quarter while being sacked by Trey Hendrickson. While the pocket collapsed around him, offensive lineman Walker Little stepped on his right ankle. Lawrence then fell backward, landing on his knee with his leg folded underneath him. Lawrence sat on his knees and took his helmet off and slammed it onto the turf. He shuffled to the locker room with the help of athletic trainers. The ESPN broadcast said he was in the X-ray room and was questionable to return. — Victoria Hernandez Jake Browning and Ja’Marr Chase led the Bengals on a game-tying nine-play, 48-yard drive touchdown drive to even the score 28-28. The drive was capped off with a 1-yard TD on a Browning QB sneak. Chase had two catches during the drive, including a clutch 6-yard catch on fourth-and-4 to extend Cincinnati’s possession. Browning is up to 300 yards passing and a touchdown. Chase has nine catches, 124 yards and a touchdown. — Tyler Dragon It’s been a back-and-forth game, but the Jaguars have a 28-21 lead after three quarters. Jacksonville scored twice in the third period, a 1-yard touchdown dive from Trevor Lawrence and a 14-yard catch from Parker Washington, the first of his career. The Bengals impressed with a 76-yard touchdown from Ja’Marr Chase off another impressive pass from Jake Browning. But Jacksonville seemingly took momentum when Josh Allen snagged an interception on a trick play. The turnover led to Lawrence’s rushing touchdown. — Victoria Hernandez The Bengals made the Jaguars work for it, but Jacksonville turned the first turnover of the game into a touchdown. After Josh Allen intercepted a trick play, Trevor Lawrence only had nine yards to get to the end zone, but it took him all four plays to get there. On fourth-and-1, the quarterback took the snap and leaped over the line of scrimmage Jumpman-logo style to score the touchdown. — Victoria Hernandez Bengals head coach and play caller Zac Taylor made a questionable play call and it backfired for Cincinnati. Bengals QB Jake Browning threw a backwards pass to WR Tyler Boyd. Boyd caught the football as Jacksonville players diagnosed the trick play. Boyd then attempted a pass to RB Joe Mixon, and it was picked off by Jaguars LB Josh Allen and returned 8 yards to Cincinnati’s 9-yard line. The interception was the first turnover of the game. — Tyler Dragon Jaguars rookie Parker Washington snagged a catch at the top of the end zone for his first career touchdown. Trevor Lawrence threw the ball 14 yards and past safety Dax Hill for Washington to grab as he fell right on the top edge of the end zone. The rookie has stepped up as Christian Kirk is out with a groin injury. He got his first career catch earlier in the game and now has four receptions for 47 yards. Washington was selected in the sixth round of this spring’s draft out of Penn State. The Jaguars and Bengals are tied at 21. — Victoria Hernandez The Bengals have their first lead of the game. Bengals QB Jake Browning delivered a perfect pass to star wideout Ja’Marr Chase on a go-route. Chase caught the football over Jaguars CB Tyson Campbell and raced down the field for a 76-yard touchdown. Chase now has a game-high seven catches, 104 yards and one touchdown. Browning still only has two incompletions. He’s completed 19-of-21 passes for 261 yards and one touchdown. — Tyler Dragon Christian Kirk will not be returning on Monday night after suffering a groin injury on the Jaguars' first offensive play of the game. Lisa Salters shared the news on the ESPN broadcast after Jacksonville went three-and-out to start the third quarter. The Jaguars announced that the wide receiver was downgraded to out along with cornerback Tre Herndon, who was diagnosed with a concussion. After making a 26-yard catch, Kirk fell hard to the turf and laid on the ground for a while before hobbling to the locker room. — Victoria Hernandez The Jaguars find themselves in a competitive game at halftime. Trevor Lawrence led the Jaguars on two touchdown drives, including a 10-play, 75-yard TD drive that gave Jacksonville a 14-7 lead with 6:24 left in the second quarter. However, Jake Browning and the Bengals responded with an impressive 12-play touchdown series of their own to tie the score 14-14. The scored remained 14-14 when the first half expired. Browning was the biggest surprise of the first half. He’s completed 17-of-19 passes for 178 yards. Bengals running back Joe Mixon has both the team’s touchdowns. While the first half was a bit of a surprise, Jacksonville never trailed in the first 30 minutes of football. The Jaguars scored on their first drive and reached the end zone again in the second quarter, but the Bengals have answered each time. Lawrence has 117 yards and a touchdown at halftime. Jaguars linebacker Foyesade Oluokun has a game-high eight tackles. — Tyler Dragon Joe Mixon scored his second touchdown of the day, a 2-yard run up the middle to even the score yet again. Quarterback Jake Browning was 5-of-6 for 53 yards on the drive. He has 178 yards on the game. The Bengals have racked up more yards in the first half (227) than total yardage last week (222) in a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. — Victoria Hernandez The Jaguars answered Cincinnati’s touchdown with a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to retake a 14-7 lead. Trevor Lawrence had a nice back-shoulder pass to wideout Calvin Ridley for a 21-yard gain. On the very next play, Lawrence tossed a short pass to tight end Evan Engram and Engram scampered down the left sideline 22 yards for a touchdown. The touchdown was Engram’s first of the season. — Tyler Dragon The Bengals tied the game with a scrappy touchdown run from Joe Mixon. Jake Browning got Cincinnati in scoring position with 80 passing yards between four different receivers, including a 14-yard toss to Tee Higgins in his return from injury. From the 6-yard line, Mixon powered his way to the goal line. As he was falling forward, he expertly kept his feet shuffling forward without letting his knee touch the turf. Evan McPherson made the extra point to tie the game 7-7. — Victoria Hernandez The underdog Bengals had some missed opportunities in the first quarter. Cincinnati turned the ball over on downs on its first possession which let to a Jaguars touchdown and kicker Evan McPherson missed a long 57-yard field goal on the team’s second series. Despite two unsuccessful drives, the Bengals only trailed 7-0 at the end of the first quarter. Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence had 35 passing yards in the quarter. Most of Lawrence’s yards came on a 26-yard completion to wide receiver Christian Kirk. The only touchdown was scored by running back Travis Etienne, who reached the end zone on a 4-yard run. — Tyler Dragon The Bengals have yet to score with the first quarter ticking down. After a pass from Jake Browning that Joe Mixon took for 28 yards, Cincinnati couldn’t get much going. On fourth-and-9, Evan McPherson lined up for a 57-yard field goal. He kicked the ball and it sailed down the field seemingly centered between the goal posts, but it lost altitude and doinked off the bottom crossbar. McPherson holds the franchise record with a 59-yard field goal, which he kicked last season, besting his previous 58-yard record. — Victoria Hernandez “Duuuval!” is a rallying cry of sorts for Jaguars fans to show support for Jacksonville’s NFL franchise. The chant comes from Duval, the county in Florida in which Jacksonville is located. The origins of the chant are hard to nail down, but this is what we know. The Jaguars offense took over possession of the football after their defense got a big stop and drove down the field 51 yards for a touchdown. Jags QB Trevor Lawrence had a big 26-yard completion to WR Christian Kirk, who injured his groin on the play. Six plays later, running back Travis Etienne rushed to the right side for a 4-yard touchdown. The Jaguars’ score marked just their first opening drive touchdown this season. — Tyler Dragon Trevor Lawrence and Christian Kirk got the Jaguars offense going early with a monster 26-yard catch on their first offensive play of the game. Kirk grabbed the throw after leaping in the air and he landed on the turf on his back untouched by the Bengals defense. The wide receiver laid on the ground, visibly in pain and the ESPN broadcast went to commercial. When the game returned, Kirk was hobbling into the tunnel walking on his own power but being escorted by athletic trainers. The Jaguars announced later that Kirk was questionable to return with a groin injury. — Victoria Hernandez The Bengals had a promising first drive going but they turned the ball over on downs in Jacksonville territory. Bengals coach Zac Taylor elected to go for it on fourth down from Jacksonville’s 44-yard line, but Jake Browning was engulfed in the backfield by Jaguars defensive ends Travon Walker and Josh Allen in the backfield for a sack. Allen came into Monday with 12 sacks on the season. Walker has 4.5 sacks this year. — Tyler Dragon With a win over the Bengals on Monday night, the Jaguars would move atop the conference and then control the path to home-field advantage. — Nate Davis They say it’s a game of chess, not checkers. Either way, the Bengals are wearing their all-white uniforms against the Jaguars, who are playing in their blackout uniforms. Cincinnati debuted their highly anticipated White Bengal helmet last season and have a slightly tweaked white uniform this year. They wore the combination in a Week 3 win over the Los Angeles Rams. The Jaguars introduced the all-black uniform combination when their look was revamped ahead of the 2019 season. EverBank Stadium is painted with black end zones to go with the blackout theme. — Victoria Hernandez ➤ PHOTOS: Alternate and throwback uniforms of 2023 NFL season Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a torn ligament in his right wrist during Cincinnati’s 34-20 loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Nov. 16. The injury to his throwing hand will keep the Pro Bowl quarterback out for the rest of the season. Burrow had surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right wrist on Nov. 27. ""The procedure went as planned and he is expected to make a complete recovery,"" the Bengals said in a statement. Jake Browning — who went undrafted out of the University of Washington in 2019 and joined the Bengals in 2021 — is starting in Burrow's place. — Jim Reineking The Bengals at Jaguars game will kick off at 8:15 p.m. ET.

The players and coaches select a charitable cause most important to them and the names of those organizations are then imprinted or painted on the shoes, which are later auctioned to raise money for those charities. Many of the players and coaches have very personal ties to the charities they chose to represent. For example, Jaguars coach Doug Pederson will have footwear promoting the National Pancreatic Cancer Foundation because his brother Craig died of that form of cancer in 2021. Read more about the players’ stories and chosen charities. It was a slighter slate in Week 13 with six NFL teams on bye, but there were some massive shakeups in the balance of power in each conference, with both of last season's Super Bowl suffering defeats. Here is USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes' full rundown of the biggest winners and losers from Week 13. Sunday was a wild affair in the football universe, starting early with the controversial announcement of the College Football Playoff field. Thank the pigskin gods that the NFL’s postseason bracket isn’t constructed so, uh, subjectively? Nevertheless, it makes for a fun thought exercise regarding how that might work in 2023, given eight teams entered Week 13 with at least eight victories – suggesting the pros, as with the college ranks, have an unusual number of bona fide contenders this year. — Nate Davis The NFL's top 15 players in average annual salary are all quarterbacks, according to OverTheCap.com. As Joe Burrow proved in his new deal with the Cincinnati Bengals, teams place a huge priority on having a top-flight QB under center. Burrow's five-year, $275 million contract extension made him the league's highest paid player at a staggering average annual value of $55 million. San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa is the highest-paid non-quarterback in the league after signing a five-year, $170 million extension.

Washington Post,Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence helped from field with ankle injury,2023-12-04 23:36:00,Mark Maske,"The Jacksonville Jaguars’ promising season was thrown into disarray when quarterback Trevor Lawrence was helped from the field after suffering an ankle injury late in Monday night’s overtime loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in Jacksonville, Fla.The severity of the injury was not immediately clear. Lawrence did not return to the game and is expected to undergo further testing Tuesday.“I don’t have any information yet on Trevor,” Jaguars Coach Doug Pederson said during his postgame news conference. “We’re still evaluating him. So he’ll have more tests and things done here tonight and tomorrow. So I’ll probably have a better update for you tomorrow on that.”There were reports that the initial diagnosis was that Lawrence suffered an ankle sprain, pending further testing results. But Pederson said, “I don’t know until I talk to the doctors, honestly.”Backup C.J. Beathard replaced Lawrence and completed 9 of 10 passes for 63 yards. He would take over as the starter if Lawrence’s injury sidelines him.“We’ll see where Trevor’s at first,” Pederson said. “But listen, we’ve got 100 percent confidence in C.J. I mean, he did a nice job getting us down the field there and tying the football game…. He’s a veteran player. He’s played a lot of football. And if he happens to be the guy, then we get behind him and support him.”Lawrence was injured on a fourth-quarter sack on which his right ankle was twisted awkwardly. Jaguars offensive tackle Walker Little inadvertently stepped on Lawrence’s right foot while blocking on the play. Lawrence then had his right leg caught beneath his body as he was tackled by the Bengals’ Trey Hendrickson.He attempted to get to his feet and walk but was unable to do so, dropping back to the ground. Lawrence showed his frustration by pounding the turf with his hand and slamming his helmet.He was helped off the field by members of the Jaguars’ medical staff and was taken to the team’s locker room. The Jaguars initially called Lawrence questionable to return to the game with an ankle injury. ESPN, which was broadcasting the game, reported that Lawrence was taken for X-rays.“That’s part of the game,” Pederson said. “It happens. It’s unfortunate. But the next guy up has to be ready to go and play.”Lawrence is in his third pro season after being chosen by the Jaguars with the top overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft out of Clemson. He was a Pro Bowl selection last season while helping the Jaguars to the AFC playoffs. He threw two touchdown passes in a 22-for-29, 258-yard performance Monday before being injured.The Jaguars tied Monday’s game with a 40-yard field goal by kicker Brandon McManus with 26 seconds remaining in regulation. But the Bengals prevailed, 34-31, on kicker Evan McPherson’s 48-yard field goal with 1:45 left in overtime.The Jaguars dropped to 8-4 but still lead the AFC South. They missed an opportunity to take over the No. 1 playoff seed in the AFC with a victory Monday night. Instead, they currently are the No. 4 seed behind the Miami Dolphins, Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs.Lawrence became latest prominent NFL quarterback to suffer a possibly significant injury this season, potentially joining a list that includes the New York Jets’ Aaron Rodgers, the Bengals’ Joe Burrow, the Minnesota Vikings’ Kirk Cousins, the Cleveland Browns’ Deshaun Watson, the New York Giants’ Daniel Jones and the Indianapolis Colts’ Anthony Richardson.Rodgers suffered a torn Achilles’ tendon in his left leg only four snaps into his Jets debut in September. Jets Coach Robert Saleh initially said Rodgers would miss the remainder of the season, although the four-time MVP has left open the possibility of a return later this month. Burrow underwent season-ending surgery for a torn ligament in his right wrist. He was on the opposite sideline Monday when Lawrence was injured.Cousins’s season was ended by a torn Achilles’ tendon. Richardson underwent shoulder surgery that is expected to end his season. Jones suffered a torn ACL in his right knee. Watson suffered a fracture in his right shoulder during a game last month in Baltimore in which he completed all 14 of his second-half passes in his most promising outing of his two seasons with the Browns.Jake Browning, making his second NFL start Monday for the Bengals in place of Burrow, threw for 354 yards and a touchdown while connecting on 32 of 37 passes. The Bengals, who reached the last two AFC title games with Burrow at quarterback, evened their record at 6-6. They’re one game out of the seventh and final playoff spot in the conference.",4568,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/trevor-lawrence-ankle-injury-jaguars/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,touchdown awkwardly report goal team surgery title probably make baltimore expect regulation chosen talk kicker cousin acl prevail remain kirk coach performance tie overtime torn threw back promising diagnosis cincinnati mvp jet tonight sideline room draft viking veteran unable bengal spot evan medical postgame doug support conference loss ready miami mcpherson south injured return reach frustration confidence play member daniel jaguar yard played significant giant bowl hand left september potentially part kansa knee join ground starter possibly quarterback tendon field backup jones saleh leg currently walker guy robert news information show thrown undergo playoff debut twist espn complete locker nice game unfortunate start joe final monday list trevor beathard result tackle severity remainder evaluate snap clear call night initial inadvertently foot drop richardson ankle watson late aaron connect colt trey doctor burrow anthony slam questionable top wrist sprain step injury raven record possibility disarray achilles browning opportunity open player seed selection beneath tomorrow month lawrence dolphin initially offensive staff walk immediately pederson york city listen place shoulder rodgers prominent percent caught deshaun mcmanus fracture miss victory seventh ligament sack cleveland season indianapolis replace body include pro minnesota broadcasting instead football clemson brandon lead afc attempt job pick pound test block brown update suffer lot nfl opposite pending pass jacksonville underwent turf,-0.5580499999999999,0.0656742556917688,8.040446927374298,0.4431557041631667,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Robert Saleh pushes back on report that Zach Wilson is reluctant to play,2023-12-04 22:10:00,Des Bieler,"New York Jets Coach Robert Saleh pushed back against a report that quarterback Zach Wilson was “hesitant” to return to the starting quarterback role, telling reporters Monday that he had “just got done speaking” with the third-year player and that “the young man wants the ball.”Saleh added that Wilson, who was benched two weeks ago, made an impromptu visit to the coach’s office to deliver that assertion. It came several hours after the Athletic cited multiple sources in reporting that despite being the 4-8 Jets’ “top choice” to start this week against the Houston Texans, Wilson was “reluctant” to do so.“If he was reluctant to play, guys, he wouldn’t be here,” Saleh said. The coach added that he had not made a decision on which quarterback he wanted as the starter, with Tim Boyle and Trevor Siemian also in the mix.The Athletic also reported, per a source familiar with Wilson’s thinking, that he would agree to start if asked. But Wilson was described, per team sources, as “apprehensive due to perceived injury risk.” Aaron Rodgers, the injured Jets starter who has taken on a mentorship role with Wilson, was said to have advised him to get back under center.At his news conference and in a subsequent interview on an ESPN New York radio show, Saleh said he was aware that players in the current era could be more mindful of maintaining their health and future opportunities at the possible expense of team goals.“These new-age kids coming out, they’re used to sitting out bowl games because they’ve got to take care of their draft status,” Saleh said in his radio appearance. “These are all things that happen now, and it almost seems like it’s common. That’s where I think the modern-day athlete is missing the boat with regard to team.“So is it conceivable that [Wilson] had a conversation with his teammate?” Saleh continued. “Is it plausible or whatever? Yeah, I’m not going to say that it never happened, but at the same time, I know where his heart is. I know he wants to play. I know he still has that old-school mentality that he goes out there for his teammates.”Expected to stay on the sideline this season while serving an apprenticeship under the newly acquired Rodgers, Wilson was thrust back onto the field when the four-time MVP suffered a severe leg injury just four plays into his Jets tenure. Wilson, the No. 2 pick in the 2021 draft who disappointed over his first two seasons, showed modest improvement this year but again struggled to move the offense or rise from the bottom of the league in most statistical categories.Wilson’s travails to start this season unfolded under the glare of a New York spotlight made all the harsher by the fact that the team was given so many prime-time, nationally televised games. Boyle, who replaced Wilson during a 32-6 loss at the Buffalo Bills in Week 11, was given the past two starts. But he put up lackluster efforts in low-scoring losses, and he was benched for Siemian in the fourth quarter of a 13-8 defeat Sunday to the Atlanta Falcons at MetLife Stadium.With little reason to expect great improvement from Boyle, a 29-year-old in his sixth NFL season, or notable upside in the 31-year-old Siemian, it could make sense for New York to hope for better things from Wilson.“We’re just trying to find a way to win a football game,” Saleh said. “And whoever does that, I just want to make sure we cross our T’s and dot our I’s and make the best decision possible.”Another possible factor as Saleh ponders his options is the support Rodgers has given Wilson. As for whether Rodgers might start this week — which would cap an improbably fast recovery from surgery to repair a torn Achilles’ tendon — the coach said Monday, “Anything’s possible, but don’t hold your breath.”Concerns Wilson may have about preserving his health could suggest that, despite having another year left on his rookie contract, he is anticipating getting released by the Jets this offseason. Rodgers is expected to start next year, and he has stated that he wants to play multiple seasons for New York. The Jets’ five-game losing streak also has positioned them to have a high pick in next year’s draft that they could use on another top quarterback prospect.Saleh said Monday that whereas Wilson lost confidence last year, their conversation Monday showed “he knows damn well he should be on the football field.”“He believes he’s the best quarterback in the room, and the best quarterback for this team and the guy who gives us the best chance to win,” Saleh said. “And I’ll tell you guys the same thing I told him: I appreciate it.",4580,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/jets-robert-saleh-zach-wilson-reluctant/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,continued believe boyle sunday severe report current athlete subsequent week team surgery maintain lackluster falcon despite make expect wilson regard deliver heart coach tenure chance torn role sixth back newly mvp jet sideline room multiple draft factor apprenticeship hope speak support push athletic offense reporter conference loss stay effort improbably injured return described play quarter confidence status upside bill mentorship cross agree fast health mindful bowl struggle assertion texan left mentality due high visit preserve release damn anticipate contract bottom starter league quarterback position hold tendon saleh field leg state move guy travail told robert appreciate news show ponders teammate streak espn fact conceivable aware start game thrust kid monday trevor happen put win metlife reluctant harsher reason statistical source glare televise expense disappointed office give tim rookie time impromptu spotlight future apprehensive option perceive aaron interview concern nationally offseason find siemian notable repair houston defeat top fourth modest familiar hour injury ago decision achilles add opportunity choice player serve conversation atlanta rise dot improvement advise boat possible common acquire york past rodgers recovery zach year buffalo miss unfolded suggest season cap replace radio appearance football pick bench young hesitant great suffer nfl plausible lose reporting,0.2242,0.0655021834061135,7.545392051557467,0.3610337752525253,0,2023-12-04

USA TODAY,Florida State could still play for CFP National Championship if Mike Pence has the courage,2023-12-04 20:15:28,Rex Huppke,"A message from Florida State regarding the PHONY and RIGGED College Football Playoff selections: I’d like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important College Football Playoff selection process. If you count the legal votes, Florida State easily won entry into the four-team field. If you count the illegal votes, then they stole the selection from us, keeping Florida State out of the playoff even though we posted a 13-0 record and a victory in the ACC Championship Game. This is a clear case of selection interference, and we’re looking very strongly at interference from big media, big money and big tech. The woke Radical Leftist Communist Marxists were likely involved as well, and we will find them and they will be held responsible. Prior to Sunday’s TOTALLY RIGGED announcement that Florida State was not one of the four teams selected for the College Football Playoff – despite incredible polling numbers, the kind of numbers nobody has ever seen – we were winning among all the key committee members, by quite a lot actually. DeSantis who? Nikki Haley's GOP ascent adds to the well-deserved humiliation of desperate Ron DeSantis And then our number started miraculously getting whittled away in secret, and they wouldn’t allow legally permissible observers into the selection room. This is a corrupt system. Our goal is to defend the integrity of the selection. We’ll not allow the corruption to steal such an important selection or any selection, for that matter. And we can’t allow anybody to silence our great Florida State supporters and manufacture results. We’ve never seen such love and such affection and such spirit as we’ve seen for this. People know what’s happening, and they see what’s happening, and it’s before their eyes. Officials at Michigan, Washington, Texas and Alabama – the universities whose teams were “selected” – never believed they could win this selection honestly. We really believe that. That’s why the selection committee did the mail-in ballots, where there’s tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That’s why they mailed out ballots without any verification measures whatsoever. This was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the selection security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify committee-member signatures and identities, or to even determine whether committee members are eligible or ineligible to select. Checkmate, haters! A message from George Santos after the House voted to expel him People are walking into that selection committee meeting and nobody even knows who they are. The workers are writing down things and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming out in about two weeks, and it will shake you up and reveal corruption like you’ve never seen. Does anyone really think Texas, with one loss, won the selection over us? It’s an old, weak program, and we’re supposed to believe they got more votes than Florida State, with our huge crowds and the passion and and all the great love? Our country has had enough. We will stop the steal. This was not a close selection and we clearly won, fair and square. America is blessed with College Football Playoff selections. All over the world they talk about our selections. But you know what the world says about us now? They say we don't have free and fair selections. Sad. The truth is, we won the selection in a landslide. This was a landslide. And now, if former Vice President Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the selection. It’s that simple. Let’s hope Mike does the right thing. But regardless, we will fight. We will fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a College Football Playoff system anymore. So we won the selection, clearly. And we will be there on Jan. 1 to play in either the Rose Bowl or the Sugar Bowl, it doesn’t matter which one. Nothing can stop our movement, which is the greatest college football movement the world has ever seen. Be there. Will be wild! (Adapted from speeches by former President Donald J.

USA TODAY,"Colorado coach Deion Sanders in market for 'portal QBs, plural' as transfer portal opens",2023-12-04 20:08:27,Brent Schrotenboer,"Colorado football coach Deion Sanders is in the market for “older quarterbacks” in the transfer portal this month after a recent series of developments at that position for the Buffaloes, including a back injury suffered by his starting quarterback son Shedeur. Sanders said in an interview with USA TODAY Sports Monday that Shedeur was on pace to heal from a fracture in his back by the spring and will return to Boulder for his final season of college eligibility as a senior in 2024, along with his brother Shilo, a safety for Colorado. Their father still wants insurance for the most important position in football and downplayed the recent decision by two high school quarterback recruits to change their minds about joining Colorado in 2024 and 2025. Sanders discussed these topics and more during an interview about Season 2 of his documentary series “Coach Prime” on Amazon Prime Video, which debuts Thursday. “Right now, we’re looking for older quarterbacks, because we plan on winning,” Deion Sanders said. “So if something were to happen to Shedeur, they could step right in and make it happen. That’s what we’re looking for. We’ve already mapped out what we need in each position way before the season concluded. So we already knew and know what we’re looking for. So we’re right on pace to go find what we’re looking for, and we know where it is.” Does that mean he’s looking for a quarterback in the transfer portal, which opened for business Monday? “Portal QBs, plural,” Sanders said. It works to his advantage that Season 2 of “Coach Prime” on Amazon starts Thursday, the same week the portal opens, helping serve as a high-profile recruiting advertisement for the Colorado football program with its behind-the-scenes look at Sanders’ first season at Boulder in 2023. Sanders and his agents have editorial control over the project. That’s the goal of it. “It’s going to instill hope in a multitude of people,” Sanders said via Zoom. “I love everything about it. It helps us recruit. It helps us establish who these young men are.” TRANSFER PORTAL: Tracking top players in the college football transfer portal Despite setting a school record for most passing yards in a season, Shedeur Sanders was the most-sacked quarterback in major college football in 2023 with 52 sacks. He missed the last game and a half after suffering an arm injury, an ankle injury and a fracture in his back. He only has one season of college eligibility remaining and could enter the NFL draft next year if he wanted to, especially to cash in on his football value instead of risking further injury in college. So could his brother Shilo. But both have been expected to return to Colorado in 2024 after the team finished 4-8 in 2023. Sanders reaffirmed that notion when asked if they are definitely returning to Boulder. “I would think so,” he said with a laugh. “They’re my sons. I would pray so.” But it's ultimately up to them, right? “It’s up to us,” Sanders said. “We do things as a family, and my sons respect the heck out of me and my decision-making and getting them to where they desire to go. … It’s always been our dream that they’re going into the draft together, and we didn’t know how that would manifest itself with (the COVID-19 pandemic) and everything. It just so happened properly that they’re going in the same draft at the conclusion of next season.” A back injury can be a serious thing. Will he be able to throw again at spring practice? “He’s OK,” his father said. “Shedeur is on some island right now having a good time enjoying the fruits of his labor. So he’s gonna be OK. Shedeur’s a trouper. He’s a fighter. He’s strong-willed. He does what he needs to do to heal to get the process started. He just needs rest. He took a lot of shots. He took more shots than probably any other quarterback in the country, and that’s our fault, because we’ve got to shore up that offensive line. That’s what we’re doing in the portal today − trying to shore up that offensive line to make sure we have protection for him, because he can flat-out play this game.” Colorado recently lost two starting offensive linemen who said they plan to enter the portal and leave the team. The Buffs also recently had two high school quarterback recruits renege on their commitments to join the team in 2024 and 2025. Sanders didn’t talk about those recruits by name but noted one of them was a recruit closely tied to former Colorado offensive coordinator Sean Lewis, who recently left to become head coach at San Diego State. The other quarterback, Antwann Hill, was set to join the team in 2025. “That’s a long way away to stay in love,” Sanders said of 2025. Sanders then noted that freshman quarterback Ryan Staub performed well in Shedeur’s absence in Colorado’s last game, a 23-17 loss at Utah. “You’ve got to understand our backup quarterback did a great job in the last game,” Sanders said. “Now that discouraged some people as well. He played a great game against Utah, so that was discouraging to some recruits as well.” “Yeah, most likely,” Sanders said. Shurmur, a former NFL head coach, took over play-calling duties for the final four games of the season after Lewis called plays for the first eight. The team’s offensive production went down under Shurmur, but that also could be attributed to the demise of Shedeur’s health and a beaten-down offensive line. Sanders was seen expressing displeasure at Lewis after a sack of Shedeur in a loss to UCLA. Lewis’ subsequent demotion from play-calling duties increased speculation of friction between Lewis and Sanders. But Sanders boasted of Lewis’ elevation to head coach at San Diego State as a badge of honor for his program. “I get my wisdom from (Alabama) coach (Nick) Saban,” Sanders said. “Man, there’s not a year goes by that Coach Saban don’t lose how many coaches? Because they elevate. That's part of the game, and I want them to elevate. … Coach Lewis came with the intention of having a great year and leaving. That’s what it was … That what the plan was, and the plan was executed. Nothing has transpired that has caught us off guard. Not one thing.” “I would welcome it, because this stuff is good,” Sanders said. Season 2 debuts Thursday and picks up after Season 1, which focused on Sanders’ final season as coach at Jackson State, right up to when he was announced as Colorado’s head coach on Dec. 4, 2022, one year ago Monday. Sanders noted a storyline in the new season which delves into the relationship between Colorado receiver Jimmy Horn Jr. and his incarcerated father. “The promise I made to his father was I was going to look out for him and take care of him,” Sanders said of Horn Jr. “And some of the things we talk about throughout the game, like, 'Hey man, Pop is watching you. Let’s go!' And then he goes out and makes (a big play). It’s phenomenal. I mean, this stuff is made for television, and you get a chance to see behind the curtains.” Follow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

He made his return at the Bahamas, and while the 47-year-old surprised many with his solid play, Woods bested only two players in the field.That didn't prevent Woods from climbing to 898th in the OWGR, his highest since before withdrawing from the 2022 PGA Championship.That also doesn't speak to the fact that the Hero World Challenge is an unofficial PGA Tour event.LIV had its application to earn OWGR points denied earlier this year, largely because its events are limited to 48 players competing in a three-day shotgun start format with no cut that also includes a team aspect.But that Woods could climb 430 spots in an unofficial event in which he finishes third to last will almost certainly draw ire from those who believe LIV players should be earning rankings points.Woods finished ahead of only reigning U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark and Will Zalatoris, who made his own return from a back injury that sidelined him the past nine months. Zalatoris remained at No. 33 in the world despite finishing last by nine shots.Zalatoris earned 2.1 world ranking points for his last-place finish in the Bahamas.

ABC,"Heisman finalists: LSU QB Daniels, Oregon QB Nix, Washington QB Penix Jr., Ohio St WR Harrison Jr.",2023-12-04 19:01:00,RALPH D. RUSSO AP college football writer,"LSU's Jayden Daniels, Oregon's Bo Nix and Washington's Michael Penix Jr., transfer quarterbacks who have all played at least five college seasons, and Ohio State receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. were announced as the Heisman Trophy finalists on Monday night.The Heisman has been given to the nation's most outstanding college football player since 1935. This year's winner will be announced Saturday in New York. The top four vote-getters determined by more than 870 voters, which include members of the media and former Heisman winners, are selected as finalists.With Nix and Penix, the Pac-12 has two Heisman finalists for the first time since 2010 when Stanford's Andrew Luck was the runner-up to Auburn's Cam Newton, and Oregon running back LaMichael James finished third in the balloting.The Pac-12 is in its final season with its current membership before 10 schools depart, including Oregon and Washington to the Big Ten.A look at each finalist's road to Manhattan.Daniels had one of the most prolific seasons in Southeastern Conference history for the 13th-ranked Tigers (9-3), his second at LSU and fifth overall after starting his career at Arizona State. He passed for 3,812 yards and 40 touchdowns and ran for 1,134 yards and 10 TDs.Daniels is trying to become the third LSU player to the win the Heisman, first since Joe Burrow in 2019 — another transfer quarterback in his second season in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.Daniels is also trying to become the rare Heisman winner in the BCS/CFP era to win the award with a team that wasn’t in contention for a championship late in the season. The last player to win the Heisman on a team with a 9-3 record was Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson in 2016.Harrison has 67 catches for 1,211 yards and 15 touchdowns, and his trip to New York gives No. 7 Ohio State (11-1) Heisman finalists in five of the last six seasons.Harrison’s overall numbers lag behind some of the other star receivers around the country, but he was the most consistent threat for a Buckeyes offense that was breaking in a new starting quarterback and dealt with injuries to its supporting cast all season.He would be the fifth receiver to win the Heisman in the award's 87-year history, but the second in the past four years.

The Jets didn’t get anything done on offense yet again, resulting in a 13-8 loss to move to 4-8 on the season.A report from The Athletic pointed to multiple sources saying the Jets are leaning to putting Wilson back in place as the team’s starter — the role he had since Week 2 following Aaron Rodgers’ early departure with an Achilles injury in Week 1 — but the second overall draft choice by the franchise was ""hesitant"" to step back in the role.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMZach Wilson #2 and head coach Robert Saleh of the New York Jets talk during warmups before the game against the Cincinnati Bengals at MetLife Stadium on September 25, 2022 in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Washington Post,The Nationals’ shopping list looks familiar. It starts with power.,2023-12-04 18:19:00,Andrew Golden,"NASHVILLE — If the Washington Nationals’ offensive needs heading into the 2024 season seem nearly identical to those from a year ago, there’s a good reason for that: They are.A year after they entered the offseason needing a left-handed power hitter and upgrades at the corner infield positions, the Nationals have the same roster gaps as the winter meetings begin this week.“We’re going to look at all different avenues and see,” Manager Dave Martinez said Monday. “There’s always room for improvement. ... [General Manager Mike Rizzo] does not like losing. I do not like losing. So we’re going to do the best we can to field a competitive team.”Whomever the Nationals decide to target, they will look for power hitters, especially from the left side as a possible platoon option in the outfield, which is dominated by right-handed hitters.Last season, the Nationals addressed these needs by signing Dominic Smith and Jeimer Candelario, each of whom offered modest offense while providing leadership to younger players for a team that finished 71-91. Candelario was dealt to the Chicago Cubs at the trade deadline; he and Smith are now free agents.The Nationals’ 151 home runs were the second fewest in the majors, behind only the Cleveland Guardians’ 124. It’s reasonable to project improved power numbers from younger players such as shortstop CJ Abrams and catcher Keibert Ruiz as they develop, but Martinez’s lineup will still need help.Martinez said power will need to come from within the organization and from players not currently on the payroll.“It’s going to be both,” he said. “Some of our young players started getting it toward the end [of last season]. There’s still a lot more out of CJ, out of Keibert, some of our young guys. We do have some young players that are coming that I think can supply some power as well. But I think this winter, we’re going to look elsewhere, too, to see if we can fill some gaps that we need to fill.”Candelario hit 16 home runs in 99 games before he was traded. Smith hit 12 in 153 games but was designated for assignment last month. Joey Meneses had 13 home runs in 154 games after posting the same total in just 56 games during his breakout 2022 season. Martinez said Meneses dealt with a knee injury for most of 2023 that could have been a factor in his reduced production. If Meneses is healthy, Martinez said he will contribute at first base and designated hitter in 2024.Martinez also hinted that some of the Nationals’ prospects could be given a chance to help address the power deficiency — if they are ready. James Wood, 21, acquired in the Juan Soto trade in 2022, hit 26 home runs in 129 games across two minor league levels, finishing the season at Class AA Harrisburg. Another player to watch is Dylan Crews, the No. 2 pick in this year’s draft. Crews, who will turn 22 in February, played at three levels of the minors during his brief introduction to pro ball and is likely to open 2024 at Harrisburg, where he played in 20 games last season.“It’s easier to hit a three-run homer than it is to kind of string together four or five hits with these elite pitchers and these elite bullpens,” Rizzo said. “Power is a way of scoring runs and winning games. We think, in the minor leagues, we’re developing it. We’ve got several players that we think fit that description. And in the meantime, you saw players take jumps in their power game from the year before to last year.”The Nationals have five outfielders on the active roster. Lane Thomas, who led the team with 28 home runs, will be the right fielder. Martinez said Victor Robles will get another chance to nail down the center field job as long as he’s healthy — or the Nationals could turn to Jacob Young, who ended the season there. If Young doesn’t beat out Robles, he, Alex Call and Stone Garrett — once he returns from his leg injury — would be in the mix in left field. But all five are right-handed hitters. The left-handed Wood, whom MLB.com ranked baseball’s No. 7 prospect in 2023, would be a natural fit but needs to greatly cut down on his strikeouts. (Crews was ranked No. 4.)In the infield, Brady House, 20, is a talented third base prospect who jumped two levels last season but probably needs more time to develop. It’s possible that Martinez would feel comfortable opening the season with Carter Kieboom, who hit .207 in 94 plate appearances a year ago, or Jake Alu, who hit .226 in 175 plate appearances, at third, but the team is looking for more offense there.The young players are pushing, Martinez acknowledged, but the Nationals are trying to be patient with their prospects while filling gaps on their major league roster.",4663,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/nationals-winter-meetings-rizzo-martinez/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,contribute homer decide team organization ruiz reasonable cut probably outfielder ball upgrade turn winter dominate wood chance hitter number jeimer avenue lineup active february signing free watch washington bullpen offer room factor draft plate especially chicago healthy dominic base general run identical push class offense prospect ready long dave return score outfield major trade national string keibert played fit aa candelario left joey strikeout nashville nail knee breakout target deficiency platoon catcher league position martinez victor field roster dylan currently leg baseball guy develop total kind brady cub enter meeting start game supply monday introduction power mike win reason hit dealt call cj james give time alu different minor crew whomever jake option soto easy stone side offseason finish harrisburg alex home head center post competitive guardian modest mix lane address injury jump ago jacob opening comfortable roble pitcher improve elite open shortstop player manager month offensive improvement gap jumped garrett reduce possible kieboom acquire smith provide production designate leadership meantime greatly house abrams beat year fielder begin corner acknowledge meneses cleveland season carter level pro rizzo feel thomas ranked deadline assignment lead appearance patient job project fill pick young natural description infield lot juan hint talented lose,0.9903,0.0,6.781147028154329,0.4487278244631184,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,"NFL could discipline Eagles, security staffer for sideline incident",2023-12-04 18:04:00,Mark Maske,"The NFL will look into Sunday’s sideline incident in Philadelphia that led to the ejection of San Francisco 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw and could impose disciplinary measures against the Eagles and their security staffer involved in the episode, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.It was not immediately clear when the league’s review will be completed or what disciplinary actions could be taken against Dom DiSandro, the Eagles’ chief security officer, or the team.Eagles Coach Nick Sirianni said during a news conference Monday that he had not heard from the NFL about the incident or its review.“Dom is as good as they get in this business,” Sirianni said of DiSandro, who has been with the Eagles since 1999 and also has the title of senior adviser to the general manager. “And I’m so thankful for him. He’s going to always try to defuse situations, right? That’s what he does. That’s his job. And so [it was] obviously unfortunate yesterday. But I know in Dom’s heart he truly was trying to defuse the situation right there. I’m sad that it came to what it came to, that anybody got thrown out of the game. … There was a lot of emotion in that game.”DiSandro was standing near Sirianni on the Eagles’ sideline when the incident took place during the third quarter of the 49ers’ 42-19 win at Lincoln Financial Field in a rematch of last season’s NFC championship game.Greenlaw was penalized for a tackle of DeVonta Smith in which he slammed the Eagles wide receiver to the turf along the Philadelphia sideline. That angered DiSandro and others, leading to a verbal and physical confrontation with Greenlaw.Greenlaw took a left-handed swipe at DiSandro’s face. The officials, in consultation with members of the NFL’s officiating department in New York, ejected Greenlaw. They also ordered DiSandro to leave the sideline. He received an ovation from the crowd as he exited.Walt Anderson, the NFL’s senior vice president of officiating, told a pool reporter Sunday that Greenlaw “made contact with the staff member, which warranted his disqualification.” Anderson also said that DiSandro “was contributing to that escalation” but added that the NFL’s rule guiding the use of instant replay in such situations “does not afford us the ability to help the officials in throwing a flag that they do not throw for a non-player. That’s only afforded for a player action.”49ers Coach Kyle Shanahan and some of his players said following the game that they were particularly upset that a non-player and non-coach for the Eagles was involved in the incident.“That’s why I tried my hardest not to lose my mind and embarrass myself too bad,” Shanahan said during his postgame news conference. “I didn’t get to see it all from where I’m at. But when I started hearing people explain it to me and stuff, I just can’t believe someone not involved in a football game can taunt our players like that and put their hands in our guy’s face.”Sirianni and Shanahan spoke on the field following the game, and Shanahan praised Sirianni’s handling of the matter.“We just talked after the game,” Sirianni said Monday. “You just always are going through it. It was really more so to say to Kyle, ‘We respect you guys and respect your team.’ So that’s what that was about.”",3263,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/eagles-49ers-fight-security-ejected/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,contribute believe sunday tackle swipe incident verbal ability spoke clear kyle title rule senior lincoln taunt action make defuse ejection explain emotion contact business talk philadelphia officer penalize heart particularly coach hardest dom department sirianni slam confrontation devonta vice thankful president receive familiar embarrass stuff respect sideline security dre official episode add involve staffer disandro receiver throw general player shanahan manager postgame financial warrant staff instant upset immediately conference reporter linebacker afford smith york rematch impose quarter member place chief disciplinary nick hearing greenlaw flag ovation heard anderson replay stand nfc hand physical sad situation consultation turf championship season matter guide order league officiate field leave san francisco pool praise guy follow lead eject told mind football handle news job thrown crowd yesterday eagle wide complete adviser lot measure nfl unfortunate escalation game angered start monday lose review put person win,0.5753,0.0,7.563090909090906,0.4417343073593074,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Why the New York Yankees should trade for Juan Soto,2023-12-04 17:06:00,Chelsea Janes,"NASHVILLE — One of the most accomplished and durable young left-handed hitters in baseball history is available because the San Diego Padres need to save money and probably cannot afford to pay him when he becomes a free agent after the 2024 season.One of the more storied franchises in sports is coming off a disappointing season in a stretch of disappointing seasons defined largely by the team’s inability to balance out an oft-injured lineup that had far more right-handed power than it could secure from the left.Juan Soto, who has proved himself capable of transforming a lineup on his own, could provide the New York Yankees with exactly what they need to make their lineup steadier and more balanced. They should not miss the chance to let him.The Yankees and Padres have been talking about a potential deal for Soto, according to reports. The Padres’ asking price — reportedly seven young players, or more people than it took the Padres to acquire Soto and Josh Bell from the Washington Nationals two summers ago — has been too high for the Yankees. Soto is, at this point, a one-year rental. Not wanting to empty the farm system is understandable.But the Padres need affordable starting pitching for their big league roster and could use some depth in the minors, too. The Yankees have it in Clarke Schmidt, Michael King, Randy Vásquez, Jhony Brito and others. Few teams can consider starting pitching expendable, and after Luis Severino signed a free agent deal with the New York Mets, the Yankees certainly could use some depth. But they are pursuing 25-year-old Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto and have reason to bet on a bounce-back season from last year’s free agent prize, Carlos Rodón.What they do not have is a quick fix for an aging, unbalanced lineup that probably needs to be overhauled by a front office under pressure to win now. Fixes such as those are hard for any team to find, and they are particularly difficult to unearth in the Bronx, where more than one established star has faded under the scrutiny. But Soto has, in a limited sample, thrived in New York as an opponent. To the extent that it is relevant, he has a .339 average, 1.165 OPS and 11 homers in 33 career games at Citi Field, home of the Mets. And asked whether he has any concerns about his former pupil handling the pressure of New York, Nationals Manager Dave Martinez did not hesitate.“No,” he said Monday at MLB’s winter meetings as a half-dozen Yankees reporters crowded in to ask that very thing.“The first time I ever met him, I just asked him, ‘What motivates you?’ ” Martinez said. “… The first thing he says: ‘I love baseball. That’s all I want to do.’ So I think he’ll handle [New York] very well.”More importantly than all that, Soto owns a 1.219 OPS in seven career games at Yankee Stadium despite a .133 batting average on balls in play during those appearances. And crucially for the Yankees, who have not harnessed the advantages of their short right field porch in recent years, he has hit four homers in seven career appearances at Yankee Stadium — and for a player who some evaluators think has been too patient at times during his Padres career, too willing to work a walk, that short porch could provide incentive for him to be a little more aggressive. Of course, the line between trying to do too much and making the most of his once-in-a-generation eye is a fine one.But that is a problem for a later time. The more pressing hurdle for the Yankees, at least in terms of their willingness to pay what the Padres seek, is that Soto, who is represented by Scott Boras, becomes a free agent after this season. He and Boras, memorably, turned down a Nationals extension offer of more than $400 million before Washington traded him to San Diego. Boras was firm then — and has been since — that Soto is a special player deserving of a bank-breaking if not record-breaking deal. So any team acquiring him for next year probably will have to confront the reality that he could depart after next season.For a team such as the Seattle Mariners, who some have suggested might be a fit for Soto after they offloaded Eugenio Suárez, Evan White, Marco Gonzales and Jarred Kelenic over the past few weeks with the stated purpose of clearing payroll, that concern would be very real. They do not know if Soto would like playing there. They have never given a contract that big before. The Toronto Blue Jays, who could use some power in the outfield, have reportedly expressed interest in Soto, too. But they are also facing the prospect of their two homegrown stars, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette, hitting free agency after the 2025 season. Could they pay them and Soto? Would Soto want to play for them?The Yankees have not been as free-spending in recent seasons as they used to be. And Soto, who has struggled at times defensively and seems likely to age into a designated hitter role at some point during the later years of any megadeal, would be one of many offense-first outfield/DH types on their roster. Giancarlo Stanton is under contract through at least 2027 and has such a lengthy injury history that he seems likely to need the designated hitter’s spot for the bulk of his tenure. Soto, therefore, might lock the Yankees into the same kind of roster issues — namely, a logjam of less mobile sluggers — that have plagued them in recent seasons. But they are also the Yankees, which means they have a history of spending that suggests they would be able to pay Soto long term and offer the kind of stage that might make him want to sign there long term.",5573,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/yankees-juan-soto-trade-candidates/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,willingness logjam homer stanton blue suggests report bet interest advantage type firm week toronto team deal brito press pitch inability probably despite make ball turn talk bulk seek winter agent express padre yamamoto prize japanese save tenure incentive mobile sign chance hitter suárez depart pursue slugger role limited lock lineup price agency gonzales free age washington offer hard scrutiny boras define point million evan spot giancarlo harness stretch difficult represent quick batting reportedly mlb reporter prospect long afford dave unearth system diego play eye outfield trade national payroll fit seattle struggle sport high randy megadeal yankee overhaul durable severino nashville stadium work purpose contract league martinez luis field roster white san state baseball spending potential pressure pay kind depth crowd empty bichette accomplish importantly meeting start game king relevant monday vásquez power lengthy sample win guerrero aggressive reason ops hit fine reality former office mets give career time history minor josh consider bell soto front concern rental eugenio kelenic find particularly problem home opponent evaluator hurdle fix stage steadier real extension love issue injury storied clearing bronx money jarred ago affordable porch ace confront homegrown summer secure prove largely big player manager walk yoshinobu acquire mariner establish franchise provide york accord offload designate past memorably available capable line crucially extent jay schmidt year fade plague miss michael thrive star suggest carlos season jhony special short motivates clarke handle appearance patient marco expendable balance course young deserve vladimir defensively farm average term unbalanced transform recent pupil scott disappoint,0.98605,0.1614929122555176,7.97693989071038,0.4623328282828281,0,2023-12-04

Washington Post,Only way to honor Washington fans is to bring football back to D.C.,2023-12-04 15:39:00,Petula Dvorak,"It was dark and misty as I was talking my way through the second police barricade of the night.“Please, Officer. Grandpa is in a wheelchair right under the big FedEx sign; we’re trying to get to him, ” I told one of the many officers protecting the Commanders football stadium hours after a trouncing — the 15-45 loss to the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.He was sympathetic and directed me to a wild route behind jersey barriers and along a private access road to get to the spot where my husband and his father had been waiting for me to pick them up after the game for two hours. Grandpa couldn’t walk to any of the parking outposts that were available that day, a bad one for his mobility.This janky system is a catastrophe — a team with an aging stadium in a part of Maryland that’s a mile away from a Metro station — that Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) is fighting to keep and improve, and both D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) are angling to get.At stake are bragging rights, and, project boosters always insist — economic revitalization. But stadiums are a political hot potato in U.S. cities, with critics often questioning whether public investments come at the expense of a community’s more urgent needs.As the Commanders see the end of their lease in 2027 and consider a return to D.C., the city will compete with the public money Virginia and Maryland are sure to flash. Last year set records for the levels of publicly funded sports projects, from more than $1 billion to build a new home for the Buffalo Bills to roam; a $1.2 billion upgrade to the roosts of the Baltimore Ravens and Orioles; to $1.2 billion for the Tennessee Titans.While Moore has the most to lose in this battle with his regional colleagues, D.C. has the most to gain. (Come on, Maryland. You’ve got the Ravens — and voting rights in Congress. The Commanders should come home.) Often missing in debate among the DMV’s power brokers are simple and fundamental questions: What would the user experience be like, and would it align with how people live and play today?The stadiums as suburban outposts filled with RVs, tailgaters and hours of traffic — and acres of paved silence in the offseason — are the old way.For the most part, neighbors of the Commanders agree. Landover residents see traffic and trash, but not the revitalization they were promised when the Washington team relocated to Maryland in 1997. They’re getting more promises today, with a $400 million pledge of state bonds to reinvigorate the area. But they’ve heard that tune before.“When the last stadium was built, we lost,” Sandra Pruitt, a homeowner near FedEx Field, told my colleagues. “The people lost.”The fans lost, too.“Not only will the stadium actively work against you, you need to drive or [take the] train an annoying distance, and either walk a further annoying distance or sit in hours of traffic to experience a team that hasn’t made it out of the wild card round since 2005,” said Caroline Darney, managing editor at USA Today’s Bet for the Win, after FedEx Field was voted the worst NFL stadium last year.I had one good experience at FedEx Field in September, when I was invited by the law firm hosting former cheerleaders who were celebrating the end of Daniel Snyder’s controversial ownership during the season opener. I cruised up to the stadium with my platinum parking pass (something that would’ve cost me more than $200), breezed into the stadium and was whisked up to the club level on a private elevator.Now contrast that with this past Sunday, when I tried to take my family to a game as a mere mortal, as part of a fundraiser for my son’s school.After shelling out nearly $400 for nosebleed seats, we struggled to get in and out with a less-than-nimble grandpa, without spending an additional fortune for premium parking.More than an hour after Sunday’s game, fans were still squatting on random curbs and corners, trying to get home, picking their way through the puke in the tailgating lot, jostling with hundreds of others using ride-hailing services in a chaotic parking lot. It was a disaster.Now compare that to going to a game at Nationals Park, Audi Field or Capital One Arena. Smack in the middle of town and on the spokes of a city’s transportation network is the future for any team that wants to stay relevant.We’ve biked, scootered, walked and driven to games in this town, and none of that was as miserable as the times we tried (twice over 20 years) to visit FedEx Field.The wonkville that is D.C. is a serious sports town that boasts four recent national titles (yes, because remember the Mystics and D.C. Divas also won around the time the city was celebrating Caps and Nats wins). And with Washington in its team name, folding fandom into the rhythm of life within city limits is the only way the Commanders can honor their fans.The possibility of a Commanders return to D.C. became more tangible this year, as the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability approved legislation for the federal government to extend the city’s lease on RFK Stadium’s 190-acre campus for 99 years, allowing for another residential and retail district to grow there, Nationals Park-style.Because NFL stadiums are low use, it can actually be an open vote of confidence for the youth of D.C. as a showcase for championship games, band battles and other events on the off days.Not all residents of Northeast Washington want a stadium there. I live on Capitol Hill and understand the impact could be extreme. But I moved there knowing I wasn’t signing up for a tranquil suburb.Right now, RFK Stadium is a sad hulk, a memory of the time D.C. football dominated with three Super Bowl championships between 1982 and 1991.",5728,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/04/dc-commanders-fedex-field/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,today sunday super trounce trash relocate private campus bet firm capitol nats team law title political wes jersey make baltimore hulk upgrade premium talk legislation capital squat dominate drive extreme cruise build misty park jostling sign live pave barricade controversial ownership nosebleed signing tranquil metro age washington pruitt experience service dark user wild fundamental million spot neighbor accountability protect landover glenn club set diva loss youngkin regional stay miami snyder editor mystic breeze oversight return system opener area whisk play confidence band daniel bill debate national agree critic wait heard resident police memory bowl struggle fundraiser approve align sport september manage visit actively contrast potato part stadium work simple wonkville championship commander network roam father parking revitalization suburban field hundred state low move spending bond told moore oriole direct bragging billion battle curb boast round road annoy host hot traffic game remember middle community vote rv barrier power urgent gov mortal win fund sympathetic darney cost spoke grandpa angle expense maryland former investment virginia station arena time public husband fedex consider northeast future impact caroline platinum access officer muriel stake offseason grow rfk lease train tennessee district colleague voting roost home compare hill extend scootered wheelchair celebrate hour raven record economic money possibility additional improve insist catastrophe town big open tailgater distance homeowner built dolphin question mile walk event smack federal booster city rhythm past fortune bike audi available retail seat fandom driven away house fold honor limit understand day year buffalo corner miss compete bowser silence random publicly sad residential congress dmv family usa promise season miserable card committee level cap tailgate puke government life fight sandra football r youth project pick fill janky chaotic cheerleader reinvigorate transportation mayor showcase tangible shell lot pledge invite acre nfl flash outpost broker recent lose route,0.89665,0.2094972067039106,8.108656716417908,0.4558958308958307,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Capitals are blown out by Coyotes; Evgeny Kuznetsov is healthy scratch,2023-12-04 14:55:00,Bailey Johnson,"TEMPE, Ariz. — The Arizona Coyotes are no longer one of the worst teams in the NHL. They entered Monday night’s game against the Washington Capitals in seventh place in the Western Conference, putting them atop the West’s wild-card race more than a quarter of the way through the season.The Coyotes are on the upswing, emerging from years of being a bottom-dweller with the help of rising young players and veterans entering their prime. The Capitals, on the other hand, are tumbling into a downswing, and Monday’s 6-0 loss at Mullett Arena put that disparity on display. Arizona’s speed, tenacity and skill exposed Washington at nearly every turn.Goaltender Darcy Kuemper was pulled in the first period after allowing three goals on five shots, including on the first two shots he faced. Charlie Lindgren didn’t fare much better in relief, allowing two goals on five shots before the period ended. He finished with 19 saves on 22 shots.“If you go down the checklist of areas of the game where — goaltending, special teams, everything — we get severely, severely outplayed,” Coach Spencer Carbery said. “Just go down [the list], right? Special teams, power play, penalty kill. Their power play is on point. Ours isn’t. Penalty kill gives up [two goals]. Theirs doesn’t.”The scoring chances between the teams were relatively even, but many of the Coyotes’ opportunities came after turnovers or amid poor defensive sequences — including a two-on-zero shorthanded rush that led to Arizona’s final goal in the second period.Connor Ingram made 26 saves to post the shutout for Arizona.“It was a pretty ugly game, I think, for everyone tonight,” Lindgren said. “It was our fifth game on the road trip, still no excuses. We’ve got to show up and play better than that.”As the Capitals looked lost during the ugly loss, Evgeny Kuznetsov could only watch from afar. The 31-year-old center was set to play his 700th game Monday, but his career tally remains at 699 after he was a healthy scratch.Kuznetsov has nine points (four goals, five assists) in 19 games. He was benched for the final 5:54 of the Capitals’ 4-1 loss at the Vegas Golden Knights on Saturday.“Just a reset, a mental reset for him,” Carbery said Monday morning. “He’s just been struggling of late to find his game. We’ve talked to him. We’ve looked at some different stuff. Think it’s a good opportunity for him to just take a step back, reset mentally and focus on getting his game back to where it’s capable of being.”Kuznetsov was not made available to the media Monday; players who aren’t in the lineup generally don’t speak with reporters after the morning skate. The previous time Kuznetsov was a healthy scratch was May 3, 2021, when he was sidelined for disciplinary reasons after being late to a team function.This season, Kuznetsov leads Washington’s forwards with an average ice time of 21 minutes, but he hasn’t driven play the way he does when he’s at the top of his game. With Kuznetsov on the ice, the Capitals have scored just six goals at even strength — while allowing 13.Carbery has moved Kuznetsov around the lineup, seeking a spark for the center and the team. His most common linemates have been Alex Ovechkin and Tom Wilson on Washington’s top group, but before the game at Vegas, Carbery shifted Dylan Strome to the top-line center role and put Kuznetsov with Sonny Milano and Hendrix Lapierre.“[That line] hasn’t fared well analytically at all,” Carbery said Saturday morning. “We’ve got to look to make some adjustments and change some things up.”On Saturday, that adjustment was moving Kuznetsov down in the lineup. By Monday, after he skated a season-low 15:20, the adjustment was making Kuznetsov a healthy scratch.Without Kuznetsov, Strome remained between Ovechkin and Wilson, and Matthew Phillips returned to the lineup on the third line, with Milano on the left wing and Lapierre at center. Connor McMichael took Kuznetsov’s spot on the top power-play unit.Kuznetsov’s play had dipped to the point that Carbery felt scratching him was a necessity, but Monday’s loss made it clear that the Capitals’ issues run far deeper. Washington finished its five-game Western Conference road trip 2-3 and fell to 12-8-2 on the season.A loss at Vegas, the defending Stanley Cup champion, wasn’t unexpected, but bookending the road trip with a loss to the league-worst San Jose Sharks and a blowout defeat to the Coyotes demonstrated how tenuous the Capitals’ run of success was before this stint away from home. They needed just about everything to go right — getting high-quality goaltending, timely scoring and solid defense — to scratch out victories. When any (or all) of those things slipped, the result was a dismal one.",4705,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/evgeny-kuznetsov-healthy-scratch-caps-coyotes/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,ovechkin felt shutout minute penalty goal team mental cup deeper make kuznetsov dismal talk wilson seek capital shift disparity western previous atop remain save ingram phillips afar coach champion chance pull role back outplayed lineup period morning watch washington tonight sideline scratch remains veteran blowout healthy connor point fare spot tumble evgeny speak run ugly wing jose set reporter conference stint vega loss excuse return area expose quarter play score demonstrate trip downswing assist fell group solid struggle bookending prime left upswing hand tom kill defend race hendrix goaltending unexpected dylan san move milano defense tempe mcmichael darcy tenacity relatively reset show timely defensive sonny shot strome enter road checklist turnover final game poor monday list put power knight mullett result reason severely amid clear night focus dipped longer arena give career necessity time different spark late charlie finish find alex home center post kuemper ice stanley lapierre defeat top sequence tally lindgren step stuff change issue nhl coyote pretty opportunity player rise golden skill common place available disciplinary capable shorthanded driven away west line display generally year victory seventh slip linemates season emerge mentally shark include special arizona lead success skate forward bench young carbery tenuous average medium rush speed strength spencer analytically saturday lose matthew relief adjustment,0.94395,0.3188097768331562,7.491794333683106,0.4310374149659864,0,2023-12-04
Politico,Sen. Rick Scott demands answers over FSU snubbing as anger builds over college football pick,2023-12-04 14:49:00,Gary Fineout,"TALLAHASSEE, Florida — A raging controversy over the snubbing of a football team is becoming — you guessed it — a political football.Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is demanding answers from the head of the College Football Playoff selection committee as to why Florida State University became the first undefeated team from a “Power 5” conference to be denied a chance to play in the annual event.FSU had been in the running for the four-team playoff, but the committee on Sunday announced that it had chosen two one-loss teams — Texas and Alabama — ahead of the FSU team, the Seminoles. The decision ignited a firestorm in part because it appeared to be based on the injury of FSU’s star quarterback.Even former President Donald Trump weighed in, posting on Truth Social that FSU was “treated very badly by the committee” and then added “really bad lobbying effort. … Let’s blame DeSanctimonious.” DeSantis and Trump are currently engaged in a fight to win the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.Scott on Monday sent a three-page letter to Boo Corrigan, the chair of the selection committee asking for detailed information about the process used to deny FSU a spot in the playoffs.Scott called the decision to slide FSU out of the playoffs “shocking” and he demanded “total transparency” for how the selection committee reached its conclusion. The team had been ranked fourth just a week before.“There are countless other concerns and arguments that could be voiced here, but the main issue is the justified perception of an unfair system that has wrongly disregarded the known strengths of an undefeated team over the speculated impact of losing a single player,” Scott wrote. “While I doubt the committee’s decision will be reversed to rightly reward FSU for its hard-fought, undefeated season as the committee has done for other undefeated Power Five conference champions in recent years, I do believe that total transparency regarding how this decision was reached would do tremendous good for the committee, the CFP as a whole, and the college football community.”Scott’s missive may be the first in a series of actions suggested or proposed by Florida politicians. Some state legislators have called for lawsuits, while Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) in a social media post called the bypassing of FSU a “corrupt decision” driven by television money.Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), an FSU alumnus, labeled the selection committee “trash” in a social media post. Gov. Ron DeSantis said in his own post on X, formally known as Twitter, that “what we learned today is that you can go undefeated and win your conference championship, but the College Football Playoff committee will ignore these results.” DeSantis said on Fox News on Monday evening that he was proposing to set aside $1 million in his upcoming budget recommendations “in case there ever is any litigation.”“I’m not saying that there’s going to be. They are looking at it. I don’t think that this has spoken well for college football,” he said. If legislators agreed to set aside the money, it would not be available until later in 2024.In his letter, Scott pointed out that the decision to keep FSU out of the playoffs, while guaranteeing a spot to a team from the Southeastern Conference, would cost FSU and the Atlantic Coast Conference $2 million.“While this is a significant amount of money, it is just a fraction of the total economic impact that playoff contention would have created for FSU,” Scott wrote. “Beyond the benefit to the university and its athletic program, the committee’s decision will also likely have profound impacts on the future earnings and opportunities for the players.”FSU’s season included wins over two SEC teams — Louisiana State and the University of Florida — as well as wins over ACC rivals Clemson and a win in the ACC title game on Saturday. The team’s quarterback, Jordan Travis, suffered a season-ending leg injury in mid-November.FSU still defeated the University of Florida Gators a week later with a backup quarterback and earned the number four spot in the penultimate playoff rankings. The team, however, was forced to turn to its third-string quarterback in the championship game against Louisville.The committee, however, dropped FSU after Alabama defeated reigning national champion Georgia in the SEC championship. Alabama had lost earlier in the season to Texas, which the committee put in at the third spot.In his request to Corrigan, Scott demanded emails, text messages and other communication between selection committee members, as well as any communication the members had with representatives of the SEC, the sports media outlet ESPN, and any else outside of the committee.ESPN, which is owned by media conglomerate Disney and has exclusive rights to release the playoff rankings, has come under fire because many of its announcers and pundits publicly suggested FSU should be left out of the playoffs in favor of Alabama.Scott also asked for vote sheets and notes or recordings from selection committee meetings.",5028,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/04/fsu-snubbed-college-football-pick-00129917,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/dafa61f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F35%2F9d%2F4a2ccdaf412da94499b2fe3ef3f2%2Facc-championship-football-48449.jpg,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,today believe sunday trash truth social week undefeated team title political unfair learn georgia badly detailed turn chosen earlier amount rival moskowitz fraction regard sheet louisiana shock champion chance number contention rightly acc reign travis college message justified sec snub reverse base treat million spot point run bypassing athletic spoken set conference ranking effort system reach play member weigh national twitter desantis agree force significant controversy left sport pundit tallahassee part release earnings cfp fire fox championship corrigan deny quarterback process slide backup leg currently state donalds total alabama news information answer missive lawsuit write playoff rag espn meeting game vote monday power put budget tremendous gov win rick texas cost atlantic alumnus call disregard florida announce politician former favor seminole disney perception benefit drop action transparency label create x countless future impact ron concern southeastern ignore email head conglomerate post ahead penultimate upcoming defeat demand fourth ignite representative recording president injury issue scott economic money announcer fsu guarantee single decision corrupt formally add opportunity donald gator player gop selection argument request communication jared available driven case series jordan speculate byron year boo presidential outlet publicly star legislator suggest reward television lobbying letter earn season trump university annual committee blame profound include wrongly program conclusion text ranked fight football clemson note propose suffer chair medium engage strength firestorm exclusive voiced coast saturday recent lose guess doubt recommendation,0.7161,0.2386634844868735,10.177901498929334,0.4590517241379309,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Indian chess siblings become first brother and sister duo to earn grandmaster title,2023-12-04 13:43:00,Ben Church,"Chess player Vaishali Rameshbabu followed in the family tradition by becoming a grandmaster on Friday.Vaishali, 22, became only the third woman in India to earn the title, but she is not the first in her family to achieve such a feat.Her brother, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu, became one of the youngest grandmasters in history in 2018 at the age of 12. Together, the siblings have now become the first brother and sister duo to become grandmasters, according to Chess.com.“Becoming a [grandmaster] has been my goal since I started playing chess,” Vaishali told Chess.com after earning the title at the IV El Llobregat Open in Spain.“I was so close to it so I was really excited but also I had some pressure […] I’m very happy I finally managed to complete the title.”Becoming a grandmaster is not easy and takes time. To achieve the title, players must win three norm tournaments – competitions which themselves must meet certain criteria – and surpass an International Chess Federation (FIDE) rating of 2500.Vaishali had already won three norm tournaments and eventually crossed the 2500 rating with her second-round win in Spain last week.Vaishali’s brother, one of the best players in the world, said he always knew his older sister would one day accomplish the feat.“I felt long back that she has GM strength for a long time already,” he told the FIDE last month as his sister approached the rankings points needed.“I’m happy to see that she’s finally getting to where she belongs.”",1484,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/sport/india-chess-siblings-grandmaster-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204115510-indian-chess-siblings-grandmaster-split.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month excite felt ranking sister federation long sibling achieve goal iv play accord criterion finally title knew cross time history competition rameshbabu tournament brother day manage easy international woman vaishali gm happy close belongs norm family india earn meet eventually fide back spain world follow grandmaster told llobregat pressure surpass age young duo tradition accomplish complete rating strength start praggnanandhaa approach point open player chess win,0.97795,0.0,9.081107266435987,0.5236331569664904,0,2023-12-04

Washington Post,An up-close look at the NBA Cup and the in-season tournament trophies,2023-12-04 12:01:00,Ben Golliver,"The NBA Cup, the championship trophy awarded to the winners of the inaugural in-season tournament, will find its first home Saturday night in Las Vegas.The sterling silver trophy, unveiled Monday, is coated with 24-karat gold and features eight prongs that rise from a layered black base to an ornamental circular design at the top, evoking a ball going through the rim. Designed by Tiffany & Co. with input from artist Victor Solomon, who has reworked the NBA’s trophy collection in recent years, the NBA Cup sports a gold link design around the base that mimics the net on a hoop.The NBA Cup’s specifications nod to aspects of the in-season tournament, which opened last month with all 30 squads before proceeding to an eight-team knockout round, which begins Monday, and a final four in Las Vegas that starts Thursday. The trophy’s 23-inch height matches 2023, the opening year of the event, while the trophy’s 35-pound weight nods to the opening format, which divided the 15 teams from each conference into three groups of five. The 30 net openings on the base represent the NBA’s 30 teams, the eight rising prongs reflect the eight teams that advanced to the knockout round, and the base’s three tiers represent the three consecutive elimination games that the champion must win.Unlike the Larry O’Brien Trophy, which is awarded to the NBA champion, and the major end-of-season awards, such as MVP and defensive player of the year, the NBA Cup doesn’t yet bear the name of a famous basketball figure. However, the NBA Cup’s gold color was selected to match the Larry O’Brien Trophy, the Bill Russell Finals MVP trophy and the Michael Jordan MVP trophy.The NBA also unveiled its in-season tournament MVP trophy, which features a minimalist basketball design atop two golden stems that rise from a black base. The trophy is 15 inches tall to reflect the 15 teams in each conference and boasts a 6½-inch-wide base to reflect the six groups of five teams in the tournament. The two stems symbolize the two teams that will advance to Saturday’s title game.Though the in-season tournament’s winning team will not get any competitive incentive, such as a guaranteed playoff spot or an extra draft pick, each player will receive a $500,000 bonus and a medal that reflects the achievement. The front of each medal features four lifted basketballs in reference to the four teams that will compete in Las Vegas, and the back bears a bracket design and the NBA Cup’s silhouette.Finally, media members will vote to determine the five players selected to the all-tournament team. Each player will receive a 20-pound black crystal basketball with gold lines and a bracket design. The NBA hopes that recognizing the winning team and standout players will stoke competition and build a tradition around the event, which draws inspiration from cup competitions in soccer.The NBA Cup’s design was unveiled in July at a Las Vegas ceremony attended by Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, San Antonio Spurs forward Victor Wembanyama, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards and other stars, and the trophy design appeared at center court and in the paint on the colorful courts used during the in-season tournament’s group-stage games.",3227,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/nba-cup-trophy-in-season-tournament-awards/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,height tier achievement july knockout artist squad net minimalist medal stem draw tall inch link trophy coat night elimination advance team steve title rework proceed cup guard inspiration match ball competition evoke bracket specification front colorful standout color reflect mimic sterling atop build find home center incentive coach consecutive champion anthony feature thursday basketball top back competitive format black rim select crystal prong receive nod mvp bonus tradition draft opening inaugural brien base advanced hope ornamental open spot collection player extra guaranteed represent unveiled month rise golden event conference vega reference determine timberwolves kerr tiffany antonio member major bill award circular jordan line warrior spur gold group tournament year begin russell sport court nba larry winner compete michael wembanyama star lift layer championship silver victor design divide minnesota san state aspect solomon forward weight symbolize pick defensive playoff ceremony boast famous round medium paint stoke start final game vote saturday bear figure recognize recent monday edward input attend win,0.99125,0.0,9.99847429519071,0.5257812500000001,0,2023-12-04
CNN,"Taylor Swift and Simone Biles in attendance as Green Bay Packers stun the Kansas City Chiefs, 27-19",2023-12-04 11:40:00,not specified,"There was some serious star power in Green Bay on Sunday afternoon.Twelve-time Grammy award-winning artist Taylor Swift was in attendance for the Kansas City Chiefs’ 27-19 road defeat against the Green Bay Packers.Watching on in person for the fifth time this season in support of her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Swift sat alongside Brittany Mahomes – the wife of Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes – in a suite at Lambeau Field.It was her first appearance at a Chiefs game since October 7, when the reigning Super Bowl champions took down the Los Angeles Chargers, 31-17.The pop superstar embarked on the South American leg of her ‘Eras Tour’ shortly after, with Kelce returning the favor and attending her concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Swift had been a good omen for the Chiefs coming into Sunday’s matchup, with the team having gone 4-0 with her in attendance and Kelce averaging 8.5 receptions and 108 receiving yards in those games.However, there was to be no such good luck on Sunday, as the Chiefs were downed by the Packers.Lambeau featured another celebrity power couple in the stadium on Sunday: seven time Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles was in attendance to support her husband, Green Bay safety Jonathan Owens.The gymnastics icon had previously been seen at a Packers home game this season and wished Owens luck before the game.Owens scored his first career NFL touchdown on Thanksgiving against the Detroit Lions after recovering a fumble, with Biles barely able to contain her excitement on social media.Love was certainly in the air in every sense in Green Bay on Sunday.But the biggest of all was Packers quarterback Jordan Love. The 25-year-old threw for 267 yards and three touchdowns and had zero interceptions, going 25-for-36 on passing attempts.Love is playing his first NFL season as a full-time starting QB, having spent his first three years in the league as the backup to four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers.He led the Packers to touchdowns on their opening two drives of the game and spearheaded the offense to score on five out of seven of the home side’s total possessions.Love was able to go toe-to-toe with reigning MVP Mahomes, who threw 21-for-33 for 210 yards, a touchdown and an interception, as the Packers defense stepped up to frustrate Kansas City after Green Bay had cut the lead to two early in the fourth.For his part, Kelce led the Chiefs in receiving on the night, managing four receptions for 81 yards in the game, below his average when Swift is in the crowd.The game’s ending was mired in refereeing controversy, however, with no less than four plays on the Chiefs’ final drive sparking debate amongst fans.With just under a minute to go, Mahomes took off after the snap for a first down, but was hit hard as he was heading out of bounds by Owens, resulting in an unnecessary roughness penalty.Green Bay rookie cornerback Carrington Valentine then evaded an apparently clear pass interference penalty, despite appearing to make significant contact with Chiefs wide receiver Marques Valdes-Scantling.Valdes-Scantling was again involved as the clock stopped when he was ruled out-of-bounds after a late catch. Finally, a Mahomes Hail Mary pass went uncaught in the end zone, with the officials not agreeing with the pronounced claims of pass interference from the Chiefs.The Packers escaped with their third win in a row and now sit at 6-6. They look forward to continuing the momentum and possibly entering the playoff pictures in a primetime matchup against the struggling New York Giants on December 11, while Kansas City, now 8-4, will take on the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.",3641,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/sport/simone-biles-taylor-swift-packers-chiefs-nfl-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204091612-01-packers-chiefs-120323-taylor-swift.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,green sunday artist super touchdown minute penalty tour unnecessary taylor couple social shortly team boyfriend rule cut despite make contact angeles barely referee december continue drive suite american champion embark feature threw reign travis receive icon owen mvp interception reception official gymnastics hard receiver celebrity support offense superstar wife south return score play finally bill debate yard agree significant giant gold bowl escape controversy stop picture struggle brittany patrick thanksgiving qb manage part stadium kansa packer omen early attendance possibly league quarterback backup frustrate leg detroit momentum previously total defense spearhead cornerback playoff enter road charger safety matchup passing start final game power attend person mahomes win tight result hail kelce october snap hit alongside clear night pop favor simone time career rookie husband spark late aaron side medalist contain clock home head carrington defeat jonathan spent step love apparently concert recover opening aire involve luck uncaught big fumble roughness pronounce zero valentine york city mire chief primetime sat claim jordan catch bound wish year buffalo star air swift row season buenos evade bay marque lead appearance forward olympic grammy excitement mary average lambeau wide zone interference nfl lion,0.95905,0.0,11.696408668730648,0.4344788997850222,1,2023-12-04
CNN,Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp hails ‘beautiful goals’ in game ‘you will never forget’,2023-12-04 11:40:00,Ben Church,"Those watching Liverpool’s Premier League win against Fulham were treated to not just one, but four stunning goals on Sunday, as the Reds secured a dramatic 4-3 win.Liverpool completed its comeback with two strikes in the dying minutes, but it was the quality of all four Liverpool goals that stood out the most.“I don’t think I ever saw a game with this amount of beautiful goals. We scored incredible goals today,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told Sky Sports.Trent Alexander-Arnold opened the scoring with a scintillating free-kick in the 20th minute – although the goal was eventually declared a Bernd Leno own-goal after the defender’s strike ricocheted off the Fulham goalkeeper’s back before crossing the line.The visitors then equalised through Harry Wilson before Alexis Mac Allister restored Liverpool’s lead with a sublime strike from distance in the 38th minute. The World Cup winner cut across a half-volley to send his effort into the top-right corner.Despite playing well for large periods of the match, Liverpool found itself behind in the closing stages after goals from Kenny Tete and Bobby De Cordova-Reid put Fulham on the brink of a famous win.Liverpool, though, was not ready to give up its 13-month unbeaten home run in the Premier League, and equalised in the 87th minute through Wataru Endo.The Japan international ran onto Mohamed Salah’s pass to expertly side foot the ball into the top corner.Seconds later and Liverpool had the winner through the in-form Alexander-Arnold. The England international controlled the ball on the edge of the box before firing his spectacular effort into the near corner in the 88th minute, sparking frenzied scenes inside the stadium.“I don’t think anybody would have thought before the game [that] Liverpool v Fulham will be a game you will never forget in your life,” Klopp told reporters after the match.“But you’re welcome. Whoever was here today will never forget it in their lives.”The win moves Liverpool to second in the league, two points behind Arsenal in first and one ahead of Manchester City in third, and underlined the team’s title credentials.Klopp saved particular praise for Alexander-Arnold after the game. The full-back, who was named Man of the Match on Sunday, has faced questions over his defense but continues to silence his critics with his technical ability.“Nobody is in doubt how highly I think about Trent,” Klopp told reporters after the game.“Today he was a real leader on the pitch – that’s probably the biggest improvement, if you want.”Liverpool’s players won’t have much time to recover before they face Sheffield United in the Premier League on Wednesday.

CNN,49ers dominate Eagles in playoff rematch and Miami continues record offensive season: Everything to know about NFL Week 13,2023-12-04 11:40:00,Ben Morse,"Between reignited rivalries, shock results and sideline scuffles, Week 13 of the 2023 NFL season had it all.With crunchtime of the season fast approaching, the stakes have been ratcheted up with campaigns on the line in each game.Whether it be playoff standings, postseason qualification, job security or draft position, every game has something riding on the results, so here is everything you need to know about Sunday’s action.There was a lot on the line at a rainy Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Sunday.Last season’s NFC Championship clash between the San Francisco 49ers and the Philadelphia Eagles had big implications: the Eagles booked their spot in the Super Bowl while San Francisco’s promising year ended in disappointment as the Niners lost 31-7.This time around, the pair faced off as two of the best teams in the league in an encounter which could go a long way in deciding postseason seedings for the conference.And the 49ers enacted some measure of revenge for the loss, flipping the script and comfortably beating Philadelphia 42-19 this time round.The team overcame a slow start where it fell behind the Eagles 6-0 in the first before coming online, scoring six straight touchdowns on six successive drives in what was a masterclass in offensive play calling and execution.49ers quarterback Brock Purdy – who suffered a serious elbow injury in last season’s game against Philadelphia – thrived in the hostile atmosphere, throwing for 314 yards and four touchdowns in the face of a formidable Eagles defense.Purdy’s favorite target was Deebo Samuel, who finished with 116 receiving yards and two touchdown catches. The multi-faceted wide receiver – who had some strong words for the Eagles defense after their previous match-up – also ran for 22 yards, including a 12-yard rushing touchdown.It wasn’t just the passing game which did the damage for San Francisco; the team’s rushing attack also dissected Philadelphia with relative ease.San Francisco totaled 146 yards on the ground, with Christian McCaffrey picking up the bulk of those with 93 yards and a rushing touchdown to his name.Afterwards, Purdy said that the team’s offensive explosion was impressive but that he and his teammates weren’t getting ahead of themselves.“I’m not getting caught up in it. It was literally every drive we have to continue to put up points, we have to score,” the second-year quarterback told reporters. “That’s just our mindset, that’s where we were at.“Guys made plays. (San Francisco head coach) Kyle (Shanahan) called a great game. Defense got stops. And that’s our mindset. It was like, man, anybody can score a touchdown at any point with our offense and the guys that we have on offense.“Was I going: ‘Alright, that’s four in a row, that’s five in a row?’ I wasn’t thinking like that. It was where are we at situationally in the game and we just wanted to keep the foot on the gas pedal and try to keep pulling away as best as possible.”It was a statement victory by San Francisco who go some way into banishing the demons from last year. The result also shifts the power dynamic in the NFC as the 49ers establish themselves as arguably the team to beat by rounding into form at the right time.With their combination of a genius head coach, offensive weapons and a stout defense, San Francisco has blossomed into one of the elite teams in the league as the season’s progressed and, although its record still sits below Philadelphia’s, the West Coast team has proven itself a much more formidable force at the moment.While the result was different from their last encounter, the tempestuous nature in which the game was played remained the same.And that all spilled over in the third quarter when 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw was ejected after a physical altercation following the conclusion of a play with Eagles chief security officer Dom DiSandro.“I just can’t believe someone not involved in a football game can taunt our players like that and put their hand in our guy’s face,” Shanahan said afterwards.The 49ers improve to 9-3 while the Eagles fall to 10-2.Mike McDaniel was known for his offensive creativity when he was part of Shanahan’s coaching staff in San Francisco. But in his second year as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins, we are seeing just how effective his offense can be.The latest display of the Dolphins’ explosiveness with the ball came on Sunday as they blew past the Washington Commanders 45-15, with multiple records being set along the way.Miami quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was electric early on, connecting with his favorite wide receiver Tyreek Hill for two long touchdowns in the first half to start the game in impressive fashion.First came a 78-yard bomb in the opening quarter to begin the scoring before the same duo connected on a 60-yard pass in the second quarter for another long touchdown.Hill finished Sunday with five catches and 157 receiving yards as well as the two scores – it was his fifth game this season with at least 150 receiving yards and a touchdown which is a record for the most such games in a single season in NFL history.The explosive wide receiver already has 1,481 receiving yards this campaign which is more than any player has had in their first 12 games of a season in the Super Bowl era. Hill is on pace for 2,098 receiving yards this season, with the NFL single-season record sitting at 1,964, achieved by Calvin Johnson in 2012.Hill has had a storied career already in the league having made a name for himself with the Kansas City Chiefs and catching passes from Patrick Mahomes, in particular nine receptions for 105 yards in the team’s Super Bowl LIV victory.But the 29-year-old admitted after the victory over the Commanders that this is his best personal season.“I feel like I’m doing a great job of being in the right spot for the quarterback and making sure I’m doing a great job blocking and just understanding this whole offense,” he told reporters. “I think this past offseason, I really had a chance to just look back and just understand my mistakes from last year and I took it head on because I’m the type of player, I put a lot of accountability on myself.“I feel like as one of the leaders on this team, I just had to step up and be better. Obviously, the stats looked good last year, but there was a lot of room for improvement for myself and I was like ‘You know what? I’m not gonna settle for that,’ you know. I feel like I can be a whole lot better, so that’s just me believing in myself.”There were more offensive records achieved elsewhere on the field for the Dolphins.Rookie running back De’Von Achane added another dynamic to the team’s offense with 103 total yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns.The 22-year-old now has nine touchdowns in the six games he has played in the NFL. According to the NFL, the only player in league history with more touchdowns in his first six career games was Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson in 1983 with 10. Achane tied Hall of Famer Gale Sayers and Ockie Anderson 1920 who both had nine touchdowns in their first six career games.The other milestone reached was by Miami’s other running back, Raheem Mostert, who scored his 16th touchdown of the season on a one-yard run at the end of the first half against the Commanders.Mostert became the fifth player in NFL history to enter the league undrafted and score more than 15 touchdowns in a single season.The Dolphins improve to 9-3 with the victory while the Commanders slip to 4-9.CJ Stroud and his young NFL career just keep on getting better and better.Stroud has personally set records in his rookie year, and now, he has his Houston Texans in position to make an unlikely playoff push.The latest impressive moment came on Sunday with Houston’s 22-17 victory over the surging Denver Broncos to improve to 7-5 on the year.It wasn’t a perfect display – with some miscues on offense – but the Texans’ defense helped bail the team out, in particular, rookie Will Anderson’s breakout performance with a season-high two sacks, four quarterback hits and eight pressures in a disruptive afternoon.The defense intercepted Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson three times, twice by Derek Stingley Jr. and once by Jimmie Ward.It wasn’t a classic Stroud performance in what has been an excellent season for the No. 2 pick in the 2023 draft, but he was able to make yet more history in what is becoming a commonplace occurrence this year for the 22-year-old.With his 274 passing yards on Sunday, Stroud has 1,740 passing yards in his last five games, the most passing yards by a rookie in a five-game span in NFL history.The victory sees the Texans draw level with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Indianapolis Colts and Cleveland Browns in a tight battle for an AFC Wild Card playoff spot.Houston currently sits on the outside looking in with the No. 8 seed, but with five weeks to go this year, there is still all to play for in the young team’s season.“We’re taking steps in certain areas that we needed to and we just have to keep it going,” Stroud said afterwards. “It’s hard to win after Thanksgiving. It’s playoff football, the term has already started, so we just have to keep it going and stack these wins.”The only negative for Houston was the loss of star rookie wide receiver Tank Dell to a serious injury.Dell – who has 47 receptions for 709 yards as well as seven touchdowns after being drafted in the third round out of the University of Houston – suffered a fractured fibula on Dameon Pierce’s three-yard touchdown run in the first quarter.The 24-year-old was involved in blocking for the touchdown but was on the ground afterwards and had to be carted off the field.Away vs. homeLos Angeles Chargers 6-0 New England PatriotsDetroit Lions 33-28 New Orleans SaintsAtlanta Falcons 13-8 New York JetsArizona Cardinals 24-10 Pittsburgh SteelersIndianapolis Colts 31-28 (OT) Tennessee TitansMiami Dolphins 45-15 Washington CommandersDenver Broncos 17-22 Houston TexansCarolina Panthers 18-21 Tampa Bay BuccaneersCleveland Browns 19-36 Los Angeles RamsSan Francisco 49ers 42-19 Philadelphia EaglesKansas City Chiefs 19-27 Green Bay Packers",10129,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/sport/nfl-week-13-sunday-review-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204101416-01-nfl-120323-brock-purdy.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,believe sunday favorite enact bronco type blew week lincoln successive alright make mcdaniel angeles bulk wilson occurrence shift altercation pace previous remain implication rivalry dameon coach ot shock ratchet negative raheem johnson promising receive titansmiami room reception dre achane hard wild receiver jetsarizona throw financial spill reporter set loss explosive online area reach score play quarter panther dissect played stout fell leader patrick thanksgiving dickerson overcame part breakout packer championship form ground standing league san currently francisco slow guy deebo defense follow told atmosphere battle playoff enter round ockie measure passing formidable commandersdenver game tempestuous undrafted put power half mahomes literally tight result niner patriotsdetroit hit call mindset foot career rookie perfect philadelphia mccaffrey late offseason finish tennessee relative revenge head orleans strong famer hill houston crunchtime texanscarolina creativity disruptive single opening progress milestone improve script qualification add involve explosiveness elite shanahan big seed stingley tagovailoa settle situationally improvement excellent impressive arguably establish past chief postseason west line caught beat nature year flip stats fracture slip sack row classic season university moment card level calvin bay proven bomb conclusion football pick young brown term scrimmage eagle nfl coast electric fall pass lose scuffle disappointment green super touchdown decide draw pair kyle team fibula falcon gas taunt ball saintsatlanta continue explosion drive gale bail hall performance tie chance pull back mistake seedings eagleskansas washington denver sideline blossom multiple steelersindianapolis draft security tampa approach point spot run accountability brock offense hostile steelers miami long particular damage pierce yard derek force anderson fast bowl stop tank hand elbow texan kansa target early miscue commander pittsburgh comfortably position quarterback word field commonplace pedal total encounter eject pressure demon surge duo samuel statement teammate banishing tyreek charger admit cart start beating win combination weapon sayers straight rid clash time history different eric book ramssan jimmie connect officer colt stake stack reignite ahead dom step injury record storied buccaneerscleveland personal intercept player mostert dolphin offensive staff linebacker achieve york city accord away greenlaw catch effective display understand nfc begin russell genius physical campaign victory masterclass thrive star gon attack christian cleveland england homelos ran indianapolis personally rainy include stroud feel afc purdy job great block dynamic sits cardinal suffer wide lot rush span liv lion,0.92145,0.148089643597591,9.78954973821989,0.4252617415026172,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Tiger Woods’ comeback at the Hero World Challenge proves he’s not ready to ‘sail off into the sunset’,2023-12-04 11:40:00,George Ramsay,"Most athletes with an injury list as long and detailed as Tiger Woods would be retired from professional sport. Woods, however, is different to most athletes.The 15-time major champion’s much-anticipated return to professional golf at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas wasn’t perfect, nor was it ever likely to be.But in his first tournament in nearly eight months, Woods demonstrated that he can still be competitive at a high standard and that his desire to keep playing remains undiminished.He finished on even par at Albany Golf Club on Sunday, placing 18th out of 20 on the overall leaderboard. His final round featured five birdies – including an excellent long putt on the fifth – as well as some wayward moments: a double bogey on the second hole and three further bogeys on the eighth, 11th and 16th.All in all, there were some promising signs for the 47-year-old. Woods averaged 305 yards off the tee, proving that his long game is in good health, and he also showed that his beaten and ageing body can still withstand the rigors of four rounds of competitive golf.“I think I’ve come a long way from being a little bit rusty to playing four days and knocking off a lot of rust, which was great,” Woods told Golf Channel after his final round.“The physicality of actually playing and competing again – I haven’t done this in a while. It was nice to get out there with the guys and have some fun and compete. I just wish I could have played a little bit cleaner but there’s always next time.”For Woods, next time will be the PNC Championship, a father-son tournament which tees off in Orlando, Florida on December 14.This will be the fourth time in a row that Woods has entered the event alongside his son Charlie and his second tournament since undergoing ankle surgery in April.In 2024, Woods hopes to play on the PGA Tour once a month. While competing in the Bahamas, he said that the Genesis Invitational in February and the Players Championship in March could be options as he steps up his competitive return.From there, he could appear at the Masters in April and even at the Olympics in Paris later in the year.“Once a month seems reasonable, and it gives me a couple of weeks to recover, a week to tune up,” Woods said on Sunday. “Maybe I can get into the rhythm of something like that. That’s what the plan was going into next year. I don’t see why that would change.”During the Hero World Challenge, which Woods hosts, he said that he had been “pleasantly surprised” with his physical recovery between rounds.He posted a two-under 70 on Friday, climbing to 15th on the leaderboard after a hit-and-miss opening round, and followed up with a 71 on Saturday.But the most important thing will be that his body held up, some eight months after Woods said that he had endured “constant pain” while playing at the Masters.The ankle surgery that followed his withdrawal at Augusta National in April was the latest in a long line of injuries which have forced Woods to take time away from golf; he suffered severe leg injuries in a car crash in 2021 and has also undergone surgeries on his back and left knee over the years.Given what he has already achieved over the course of his decorated career – 15 major titles and a joint-record 82 PGA Tour wins – you could excuse Woods for wanting to walk away from the sport altogether.“He could easily sail off into the sunset, never touch a club again, never do anything again – just go and live his life and enjoy the second half of his life, do whatever, hang out with his kids,” Scottie Scheffler, who won the Hero World Challenge by three shots, told reporters ahead of the tournament.“But he continues to come back and wants to compete and he continues to do what’s best for the players and the PGA Tour. It’s pretty inspirational for the rest of us involved in the game.”After his win on Sunday, Scheffler said that it was “very special” to see Woods back on a golf course, walking down the fairways in his iconic red and black outfit.It could become a more common sight for the rest of the golfing world next year as one of the game’s greatest players continues to rage against the dying light.",4161,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/sport/tiger-woods-hero-world-challenge-golf-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204113122-tiger-woods-120323.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,sunday severe hang rust cleaner tour athlete couple week surgery golfing title scheffler sunset reasonable detailed december continue augusta touch wood undergone pnc pga sign champion live feature back promising birdie february age bogey pleasantly sight remains paris surprised hope physicality wayward club putt reporter long sail return genesis excuse hero play demonstrate major national bahamas yard played force health tournament rest left sport high rusty red knee championship inspirational leg iconic beaten guy world follow told show undergo shot enter important round host final game nice withdrawal kid list half win desire crash alongside constant plan bit florida enjoy time different give career ankle albany perfect late option tee fun light charlie withstand finish hole post ahead scottie fourth competitive car black april step injury master friday double pain recover olympics opening pretty endure standard involve held prove player month leaderboard excellent event walk invitational achieve channel common knock place rhythm march away challenge line wish retire recovery day year decorate physical professional compete rigor row fairway moment easily body include special life orlando course eighth great average suffer rage lot climb golf tiger,0.9956,0.1441961067051189,7.964417767106841,0.4094395453654713,0,2023-12-04
USA TODAY,"NFL Week 13 winners, losers: Packers engineering stunning turnaround to season",2023-12-04 11:19:27,Lorenzo Reyes,"It was a slighter slate in Week 13 with six NFL teams on bye, but there were some massive shakeups in the balance of power in each conference. In the NFC, the San Francisco 49ers thumped the Philadelphia Eagles with their speed, physicality and ability to bounce back from an awful first quarter. The Niners are one game back in the standings, but they made their claim as the NFC top team. In the AFC, the Green Bay Packers’ 27-19 upset victory over the Chiefs means that Kansas City drops from the No. 1 seed in the conference, allowing the Miami Dolphins to slide in for the time being. Still, there’s plenty of season left to play. Here are the winners and losers from Sunday of Week 13. Green Bay had a four-game losing streak earlier this year that put the Packers at 2-5. Quarterback Jordan Love was struggling. It was looking like a lost season. Now, however, the Packers (6-6) have now won four of their last five to climb into the final playoff spot in the NFC. Green Bay’s upset over the defending Super Bowl champions was massive, as it sets the Packers up quite nicely the rest of the way. None of their final five opponents currently have a winning record. In fact, the group has a combined record of 20-40 (.333). The Minnesota Vikings (6-6) present the toughest remaining test. Winning out is not out of the realm of possibility. The midseason slump the 49ers had suddenly seems like it was ages ago. San Francisco (9-3) absolutely shredded the Eagles, handing Philadelphia only its second loss of the season. So now the 49ers have won four in a row, with the average margin of victory being 21.3 points. The Niners started out terribly, going three-and-out on their first two possessions. In the first quarter, San Francisco posted negative-6 yards, while the Eagles recorded seven first downs and 124 yards. But the Eagles didn’t convert either of their red zone trips and settled for field goals. The rest of the game, the 49ers overwhelmed Philadelphia with speed, scoring touchdowns on the next six possessions. San Francisco bullied a very good Eagles defense on third downs (eight-of-11 conversions) and in the red zone (four-of-four) while outgaining Philadelphia, 456-333. The Niners set the tone with a physical, bruising defense, eliminating the Eagles' ground game. These two may meet again in the playoffs. Right now, the Niners look like the better team. The Miami Dolphins easily handled the Washington Commanders in a 45-15 rout. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and receiver Tyreek Hill continued their dominance. The defense pressured Sam Howell all game long. But this is more about what happened in Green Bay. With Kansas City’s loss against the Packers, Miami (9-3) moved into the No. 1 seed in the AFC. That would give the Dolphins a first-round bye and homefield advantage throughout the playoffs. This would be massive for a team that is 5-0 at home this year. But − and this is a huge ""but"" − this won’t matter unless the Dolphins prove they can handle the better teams in football. Miami still does not have a single victory against a team currently with a winning record. Weeks 16 and 17 will be the litmus test, as the Dolphins face the Dallas Cowboys (9-3) at home and then the Baltimore Ravens (9-3) on the road. One quick note: the Jaguars can take the top seed with a victory Monday night. What's safe to expect is some jostling down the stretch. Very few (if any) people outside of Indianapolis saw this coming from the Indianapolis Colts, especially when dynamic rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson suffered a season-ending shoulder injury. But backup Gardner Minshew II has not only stabilized Indy’s play, he also has the Colts right in the playoff chase. A ton of credit should go to rookie coach Shane Steichen, but Minshew, in particular, has delivered in the clutch. Minshew completed 26 of 42 passes for 312 yards and two touchdowns, but it’s how he answered every punch the Titans threw with his own big play. None was bigger than a 55-yard bomb late in overtime, with the Colts needing a touchdown to win the game, to receiver Alec Pierce. The pass was perfectly thrown and put the Colts inside the 5-yard line. Two plays later, Minshew threw the game-winning touchdown to Michael Pittman Jr. to secure the 31-28 victory. Minshew, who’s on a one-year deal, is making the case for a nice payday this offseason. The Houston Texans had the Denver Broncos − the NFL’s hottest team, and one that had forced 16 turnovers during their five-game winning streak − come into their building. Both teams were tied at 6-5 and in the muck of the AFC playoff picture. Houston didn’t commit a single turnover, overcame the loss of standout rookie receiver Tank Dell (broken leg) and forced Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson, who had been reliable in the fourth quarter, into two costly interceptions on Denver’s final two drives of the day for a 22-17 win. Houston’s defense was superb. It allowed the Broncos to convert just one of three red zone trips and shut them out in all 11 third-down attempts. Rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud continued his superb season. This was a game the Texans (7-5) needed to have; because the Colts (7-5) took down the Titans, they remained in the seventh and final playoff seed in the AFC. But Houston is right behind them. It's one thing for a crew to have a poor officiating game. It's another for it to come on the Sunday night showcase. In particular, the final drive of the Chiefs-Packers game was peppered with clear mistakes. The first was a personal foul unnecessary roughness on a hit against Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes while he was still inbounds. The second was an obvious defensive pass interference that should've been called against Packers cornerback Carrington Valentine. It should've given the Chiefs the ball inside the 10-yard line. Mistakes happen. Ones this bad that affect the outcome of games, however, are inexcusable. The New England Patriots have a very good defense. We’ll say that upfront. But the offensive showing for the Los Angeles Chargers (5-7) in their 6-0 victory against New England, frankly, was unacceptable for a team with this much talent. The offensive line’s run blocking has been average at best, but offensive coordinator Kellen Moore tried repeatedly to force the run game, seemingly for the sake of balance. The result was disastrous. Los Angeles ran the ball 24 times for an average of 1.2 yards per carry. In particular, Moore tried to call the rushes on early downs, which often set up long distances on second and third downs. The Patriots' offense, which is truly horrendous, outgained the Chargers, 257-241. Los Angeles, matching the Patriots, did not record a single snap in the red zone. Drops and poor effort, mental mistakes and missed assignments continue to be the norm. It may cost coach Brandon Staley his job, and the same could be true for Moore, too. The Pittsburgh Steelers, just as quickly as they had appeared to be on the up-and-up after firing former offensive coordinator Matt Canada, came crashing back to earth. Pittsburgh (7-5) put up just 10 points on an Arizona Cardinals team that came into Sunday with only two victories and whose defense was ranked second-to-last in the NFL with 26.8 points allowed per game. The downfield passing game, which was productive in Pittsburgh’s Week 12 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals, was simply underwhelming. While Kenny Pickett did leave the game in the middle of the second quarter, he and backup Mitchell Trubisky finished the game averaging just 6.9 yards per pass attempt. Most concerning for the Steelers: red zone inefficiency was, once again, an issue. The Steelers converted just one of four trips inside the 20 last week; against the Cardinals, that number improved only to one of three. Interim offensive coordinator Eddie Faulkner and play caller Mike Sullivan will need to be far better than that. And, frankly, they start all the way at the top, with owner David Tepper. Far too often, the impatience of NFL owners leads to instability on coaching staffs and front offices, which can torpedo the chances young players — especially quarterbacks − have at success. The Carolina Panthers drafted quarterback Bryce Young No. 1 overall and, while the 11-game tenure of Frank Reich was far from perfect, that’s far too short of a time to evaluate a coach. That’s compounded when you factor in that Carolina traded its best weapon in the deal to move up in the draft. In Carolina’s first game with Chris Tabor as interim coach, the offense was more or less the same. In a 21-18 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Panthers (1-11) converted just three of 15 third downs (20%), matching their season low. Young failed to throw a passing touchdown for the fourth time this season. Carolina needs to nail its coaching hire or run the risk of further sabotaging Young’s career. Based on Tepper’s tenure, there’s nothing to indicate that will be the outcome.",8959,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/12/04/nfl-winners-losers-officiating-chiefs-packers-week-13/71792919007/,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/images/smg/2023/12/03/USAT/71795145007-1789930280.jpeg?crop=4455,2507,x0,y231",Sports,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,washington reich base slighter talent offense steichen physical plenty payday bryce goal offseason threw stretch note interception backup carry put pittman ability possession especially top attempt answer call back michael obvious miss jaguar meet horrendous early seemingly draft outgained expect streak seventh secure upset defense quarterback deliver leg drive realm hill earlier toughest mike continued distance interference raven wilson convert outcome slide give shut massive week green long quarter absolutely quickly set conversion moore defensive nfl player fourth remain present possibility inside happen champion handle tyreek test easily bengal football sullivan fail shakeup unacceptable francisco canada indianapolis rush speed thumped packer valentine career field tabor thrown sam red group line standing row costly panther england complete interim shred perfect downfield bowl win result overcame tagovailoa home inefficiency miami tepper margin offensive crash year underwhelming outgaining pepper spot cincinnati stabilize compound richardson super slump block love case cardinal pass mental currently job personal indy matt tank matter david nail upfront afc bruising terribly denver niner play bounce game shane hottest age victory reliable quick snap staley former claim finish kellen middle jostling physicality inexcusable concern suffer big cost number productive ran turnover eddie litmus cornerback dallas rookie hit front dolphin make howell power lead awful single staff improve frank overtime pickett pressure punch tie shoulder indicate minnesota showcase commit leave disastrous fire force alec houston left success charger clear hire simply climb match point bully throw superb young gardner injury colt buccaneer midseason seed earth run chris pierce day rout record jordan start crew drop office season minshew ball yard evaluate time combine ago late viking zone carrington factor loser mitchell hand defend rest touchdown mistake sabotage struggle bomb post frankly chase passing issue conference trade building stroud average slate faulkner advantage city commander patriot prove bye settle cowboy carolina angeles dominance repeatedly affect chief caller opponent titan perfectly russell suddenly continue nicely bay broken san tone eagle move brandon final receiver credit poor patrick team philadelphia standout anthony dynamic kenny winner trip score safe texan monday deal tampa sunday low sake bronco night foul huge instability torpedo playoff chance coach road baltimore norm nfc risk mahomes particular overwhelmed unnecessary short trubisky fact lose arizona show owner clutch pittsburgh tenure steelers muck assignment loss weapon picture eliminate effort roughness inbounds ground coordinator homefield nice officiate ranked kansa balance impatience,0.1182,0.1004576403616475,7.059564489112223,0.4517898497166788,0,2023-12-04
USA TODAY,NFL made unjustifiable call to eject 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw for sideline scrap,2023-12-04 11:10:38,Jarrett Bell,"Dre Greenlaw should have been flagged for his flagrant flip of DeVonta Smith. Ejected? No way. Greenlaw was tossed from the NFC title game rematch at The Linc on Sunday for mashing the face of Philadelphia Eagles security chief Dom DiSandro – and not for what resembled a wrestling ""Suplex"" takedown of Smith – during a third-quarter melee at The Linc. That was so wrong, NFL. Greenlaw was punished for portion of the incident that never should have occurred – a non-player on the sideline who had the audacity to interject himself into the situation and put his hands on a player from the opposing team. Isn’t there an NFL rule about that? Tossing ""Big Dom,"" as he’s called, in addition to Greenlaw, was hardly apples to apples. One team lost a key player from its defense. The Eagles lost a member of their support staff. There is absolutely nothing fair about that, especially when considering that Greenlaw retaliated against someone who foolishly initiated contact with him. ""I just can’t believe that someone not involved in the football game could taunt out players like that, put their hands in our guys’ face,"" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said after the game. So weird. That DiSandro was tossed on the spot (which drew a loud ovation from fans as he left the field) was the correct call. And the Eagles should draw a fine from the league, too. Greenlaw, though, should have received nothing more than a warning for an exchange with the non-player that he did not initiate. The scenario sets a bad precedent. What happens next weekend if a ball boy from Team A starts a dust-up with the edge rusher from Team B? Are they both ejected? The episode on Sunday was reviewed at the officiating command center in New York. The explanation provided to a pool reporter from Walt Anderson, the league’s senior vice president of officiating, underscored a serious loophole. Anderson said that the ""Replay Assist"" measure known as Rule 19 allowed for the video review to confirm that Greenlaw made contact with DiSandro, ""which warranted his disqualification."" Yet Anderson said the rule doesn’t allow the ability to throw a flag on a non-player that was not called on the field. ""That’s only afforded for a player action,"" Anderson told Zach Berman, the pool reporter representing the Pro Football Writers of America. The video, though, confirmed that the non-player escalated the episode – which should have weighed into the decision by referee Alex Kemp. The Eagles, though, weren’t even penalized after the security director was ejected. Even worse, the 49ers lost a key player for the rest of the game for retaliating against a staff member who should not have been in the vicinity of the ruckus. ""Big Dom"" is beloved for the security that he provides the Eagles. But the literal act of that during Sunday’s game surely crossed a boundary line.",2844,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2023/12/04/drew-greenlaw-ejected-san-francisco-niners-dom-disandro/71797046007/,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/images/smg/2023/12/03/USAT/71795145007-1789930280.jpeg?crop=4455,2507,x0,y231",Sports,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,anderson confirm exchange eject incident measure takedown smith center guy action fine weird big devonta dre mash field episode disqualification disandro walt edge initiate line act pool linc director wrestling reporter put sideline ability command especially greenlaw pro security melee fair consider writer believe chief ovation call review make kyle involve wrong receive berman staff alex video scenario rule resemble b member contact spot eagle warrant situation defense represent underscored key penalize team precedent philadelphia surely apple oppose portion weekend vice vicinity occur left senior shanahan america correct referee loud sunday rusher flagrant flag drew taunt support coach throw decision nfc boy absolutely set beloved zach york literal rematch afford audacity lose loophole league punish nfl start player president assist interject retaliate dom game draw warn foolishly ball provide weigh flip replay explanation kemp told escalate suplex toss football title hand ruckus addition rest officiate boundary cross,0.0020999999999999,0.1054852320675105,7.25429577464789,0.5906144781144781,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,"Despite a new home (and a sixth team), nothing beats Philly’s Big Five",2023-12-04 10:43:00,John Feinstein,"PHILADELPHIA — Zach Spiker was soaked in sweat, but he had no desire to change his shirt. “Holy cow” was about all he could say as he came off the court at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday afternoon. “I mean, holy cow.”Spiker’s Drexel team had just stunned 18th-ranked Villanova, 57-55, in — wait for it — the fifth-place game of the first Big Five Classic.“What an awesome day for basketball in Philadelphia,” the Dragons coach said a few minutes later after catching his breath. “It’s a great day for Drexel, for Drexel basketball, for everyone connected to Drexel in any way.”Remember, a fifth-place game.This sort of thing can happen only in the Big Five. This is Drexel’s first season as an official member after 50 years on the outside looking in. The Dragons, who began playing Division I basketball in 1974, scheduled two games against Big Five teams most seasons, but they weren’t eligible to be Big Five champions. The other five teams — Villanova, St. Joseph’s, Temple, Penn and La Salle — played a round robin most years since the 1950s, while Drexel waited its turn to be a full-fledged member.“It was being talked about when I first got here,” said Spiker, who is in his eighth season at Drexel. “We all thought it had to happen at some point, and finally it did.”It became official in March, much to the chagrin of a small cadre of Big Five traditionalists. The coaches, led by Penn’s Steve Donahue, were the driving force in finally getting it done.“Steve was the one who kept pushing it and kept me up-to-date on what was going on,” Spiker said. “Not sure this happens if not for him.”Less than 20 minutes before Donahue’s team tipped in the third-place game against La Salle, Spiker sprinted between people trying to congratulate him in an attempt to find Donahue. The two men semi-hugged — Donahue has been sick — and instantly lapsed into coach-speak about Justin Moore’s last shot for Villanova, which was blocked by Amari Williams with three seconds left. It was one of five blocks for Williams, a lefty from Nottingham, England, which is a long way from south Philadelphia.“Basketball’s not very big in England,” Williams said. “So playing in a building like this in front of a crowd like this was a new thing for me.”The entire day was new for everyone. When Drexel was finally added, the format for the new six-team Big Five was changed. Instead of the five teams playing four games apiece, the teams were divided into two three-team pods. Each team played two games — one home and one away — leading to Saturday’s tripleheader. Tradition might have dictated the games be played in the 8,722-seat Palestra, which is where the Big Five was born in 1955. But logistics and, of course, money meant the games would be played in the 21,000-seat home of the Philadelphia 76ers.“Would have been wonderful to play in the Palestra,” St. Joseph’s Coach Billy Lange said. “But you just barely have enough space to play a doubleheader in there. Three games would have been impossible.”Lange’s team beat Temple, 74-65, in the championship game for its first outright Big Five title since 2003-04 after La Salle defeated Penn, 93-92, in overtime on a banked 35-footer by Khalil Brantley at the buzzer. In all, it was a remarkable eight hours of basketball in front of an announced total of 15,215.“Did it four times in high school,” Brantley said laughing while his coach, Fran Dunphy, rolled his eyes. “Seriously, I felt like I let my team down on Wednesday when I missed the two free throws [in the second overtime of a triple-overtime loss to Temple] and I owed the guys one.”There were plenty of skeptics about this new format. The move to Wells Fargo was certainly a logistical help, but the corporate influence was at least as important. Ticket prices were sky-high, from $500 for Spike Lee seats to $150 for lower bowl seats to $45 upstairs. It wasn’t surprising that the one section that was full for all three games was, as Penn’s Clark Slajchert put it, “the nosebleed seats.” Or, as legendary Philadelphia sportswriter Dick “Hoops” Weiss phrased it, “the place where the real basketball fans sit.”But any issues were outweighed by the simple act of getting all six schools in the building at once, as well as by the quality of the games. It began with students tossing streamers on the court after each team’s first basket, a Big Five tradition that had largely gone away in recent years because of the NCAA’s refusal to recognize there’s a difference between celebratory streamers once a game and objects thrown in anger that can hurt people.On Saturday, the six coaches informed the officials they wouldn’t shoot free throws if technical fouls were called, and the streamers flew. It was sweet.Big Five coaches are friends. They all appear at several events a year to raise money for Coaches vs. Cancer. Lange has four sons, and so does Spiker. Lange’s kids are older and have coached Spiker’s kids on camp teams. Dunphy played at La Salle, got a master’s degree at Villanova and also coached at Penn and Temple. He came out of retirement two years ago to coach his alma mater and earned his 600th win a week ago Sunday. In Philadelphia he is introduced simply as “Mr. Big Five.”Donahue, the coach he beat at the buzzer Saturday, was once his assistant at Penn. They shared a lengthy hug after Brantley’s shot was officially ruled good. “I didn’t know what to say,” Dunphy said. “It’s a great way to win but an awful way to lose.”When Jay Wright coached Villanova, the Wildcats once won 25 straight Big Five games. Wright has said in the past that among his many accomplishments, including two national titles and four Final Fours, that streak might have been the most satisfying. Now Kyle Neptune, his successor, has to deal with the embarrassment of finishing sixth in the Big Five. Villanova was ranked this past week because it has wins over Maryland, Texas Tech, North Carolina and Memphis. That can’t wipe out the specter of losses to Penn, St. Joseph’s and Drexel.“We treat all our games the same,” Neptune insisted after Saturday's loss. “We do the best we can and then move on to getting ready for the next one.”Neptune knows better than that. He was twice an assistant under Wright at Villanova — including in both national championship seasons — and he knows Big Five games aren’t like other games. They carry a special intensity regardless of where they are played. That was evident again Saturday.“I like to think that Philadelphia is the best city in the country for college basketball,” Dunphy said. “Today proved it one more time.”",6569,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/philadelphia-big-five/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,today sunday share logistics felt tipped soak minute awesome owe tech hug country neptune joseph billy kyle week surprising team title deal rule division amari entire simply anger turn barely talk quality outright drive brantley stun coach cadre laugh champion eligible overtime doubleheader justin sixth alma price friend nosebleed college lee ncaa free salle difference official dragon flew fargo throw treat point spiker khalil push shirt wei refusal afternoon phrase breath retirement loss ready meant long south assistant corporate play member eye finally national played chagrin force wait school bowl drexel embarrassment left high wednesday successor shoot camp lefty palestra simple building championship skeptic temple degree full divide dick low move mr space guy carolina total congratulate act moore streamer dictate thrown accomplishment wipe spike lange crowd shot streak important round plenty final game remember kid carry sportswriter student happen put lengthy nottingham section hurt win fran basket texas cow wildcat desire outweigh memphis call straight traditionalist cancer maryland announce schedule steve time technical influence foul philadelphia object front connect roll finish buzzer find home center evident sprint satisfy bank north defeat basketball intensity format real change hour issue dunphy donahue master money inform ago hoop tradition upstairs holy logistical small lapse insist add penn prove largely big wonderful clark robin event toss legendary sweat introduce awful city place past seat march away apiece officially catch beat slajchert jay zach day year begin court instantly miss sick raise mater specter england earn season williams include special instead ranked coached villanova lead attempt remarkable course eighth great block celebratory sort born tripleheader ticket wright recognize saturday recent,0.9892,0.0456690516060283,6.3948040638606685,0.4223139489111711,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Miami has a plan with Tua Tagovailoa. The Commanders should take note.,2023-12-04 08:30:00,Sam Fortier,"Consider this scenario: An NFL team with a promising young quarterback and a defensive-minded head coach is underperforming, so the owner fires the coach and replaces him with a young, up-and-coming offensive mind in the hope that he’ll unlock the quarterback’s potential.Two years ago, that was the Miami Dolphins. This offseason, it could be the Washington Commanders.Washington is far from being a good team. Just look at the back-to-back beatdowns it has taken from Dallas and Miami. But Sunday’s 45-15 loss to the Dolphins offered managing partner Josh Harris a blueprint for improvement.In 2022, Miami fired Brian Flores, hired Mike McDaniel and built the NFL’s most explosive offense in part by developing quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.But let’s be clear: The blueprint is not as simple as finding the next McDaniel. Miami didn’t acquire a star wide receiver seemingly without a plan, as Las Vegas did, and it didn’t bet on a suspect quarterback to maximize a group of highly regarded skill players, as Atlanta did. Miami had a plan tailored to its young quarterback.Since he was in college at Alabama, Tagovailoa has succeeded most in the structure of an offensive system. He doesn’t have the ad-lib-ability of Patrick Mahomes or the elusiveness of Lamar Jackson, but he’s elite at dissecting a defense and throwing with anticipation. He’s precise. His strengths elevate a talented offense, so Miami acquired fast skill players and amplified everyone with an innovative scheme.The wealth of talent around Tagovailoa can make it easy to forget that it’s a skill to play maestro. Even Commanders defenders were conservative in their praise of Tagovailoa on Sunday.“He did what he was supposed to do,” linebacker Cody Barton said.“He plays quarterback like a point guard,” safety Kam Curl said. “He’s got a lot of weapons out there that he can use, and he’s getting the ball to them.”In 2018, Curl was at Arkansas when Tagovailoa arrived leading the top-ranked Crimson Tide. Tagovailoa distributed the ball to nine future NFL starters — including wide receivers Jerry Jeudy, Jaylen Waddle and DeVonta Smith — in a 65-31 rout. Curl said Tagovailoa hasn’t really changed his style in the NFL.“He didn’t have [wideout] Tyreek Hill [in college],” Curl added, laughing. “But it’s similar.”Miami is reaping the rewards of building a similar infrastructure around Tagovailoa. Take Hill’s second touchdown Sunday. Tagovailoa went deep — Hill was running toward the middle of the field, and the throw was outside. Hill made a difficult adjustment, caught it and sprinted for a 60-yard score.Initially, Hill said, he thought Tagovailoa’s throw was inaccurate. But when he re-watched the play, the quarterback had put it “exactly where I was supposed to be.” The play was an illustration of how Miami, in its second year in this offense, has combined and boosted elite talents. McDaniel pointed out that both players have become “super aggressive in certain windows” because of their mutual trust.“They’re independently awesome, but together they’re even better,” he said.Contrast that play with Washington’s — with its years of inconsistency, with its years of quarterback turnover and with Sunday, when Hill had five catches for 157 yards and two touchdowns as his Commanders counterpart, Terry McLaurin, had zero catches for just the second time in his five-year career. McLaurin has rarely, if ever, had enough reps with a quarterback to develop that kind of chemistry.It’s difficult to untangle Washington’s problems on offense. Coach Ron Rivera bet big on many unproven pieces — offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, quarterback Sam Howell and several offensive linemen — and inconsistency has made it hard to parse who is at fault. But it’s clear the offense is not working, especially against good teams over the past two weeks.“All you really have to do to defend this team is just be disciplined,” Dolphins linebacker David Long said of the Commanders. “They kind of struggle with the routine parts. When we watched them play, their best stuff was when Howell was scrambling or they moved the pocket and just let him try to make plays.”Howell acknowledged that Sunday was a step back. McLaurin called the game “really frustrating.” Several players seemed fed up with the refrain they’ve used all year, that the offense is growing and developing every week.“It sounds like words now,” running back Antonio Gibson said. “We’re not going to keep saying that in the back end of the season. It’s too late for growth right now.”It’s hard to know whether Howell will be Washington’s quarterback in 2024. It’s hard to know who will make up the quarterback’s supporting cast other than McLaurin, fellow wideout Jahan Dotson and running back Brian Robinson Jr. The people who will make those decisions are not here yet.But they are coming after the new year arrives. If they stick with Howell, they will have to figure out how to support him and maximize him. Howell is a different quarterback than Tagovailoa — he excels outside the structure of the offense. He’s a fearless gunslinger and an incredible runner who also has a lot of growing left to do.Soon, Harris will go looking for the people who can help turn Washington into a winner. He could do worse than Miami’s blueprint with Tagovailoa.",5288,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/dolphins-tua-tagovailoa-commanders-sam-howell/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,wideout sound middle rivera washington jerry smith talent explosive mind fed offense bieniemy suppose arkansas devonta big fellow past change offseason figure refrain turnover independently put routine acquire atlanta especially manage stick consider similar grow call back dallas lamar dolphin make growth howell lead window deep rarely excels scenario seemingly unlock curl conservative robinson innovative kind difficult defense quarterback hill runner distribute fire linebacker head rep mike jackson left wide beatdowns clear jr hire infrastructure underperform jeudy scramble plan point reward throw young long future defender run built system bet rout safety arrive nfl player season mutual tyreek dotson caught ball yard barton problem strength time step crimson incredible combine wealth amplify untangle ago late inaccurate work josh lot aggressive defend part skill touchdown alabama struggle star replaces jaylen sprint mclaurin word building college boost reap career praise acknowledge field sam fault easy hard commander group ron unproven mcdaniel suspect different fast highly simple vega counterpart piece turn maestro pocket tagovailoa dissect waddle brian miami harris cast offensive tide zero year flores offer partner gibson move gunslinger forget arrives receiver elite terry super patrick team add catch elevate cody watch awesome maximize winner parse sunday structure promising eric support style coach talented guard decision develop david mahomes fearless anticipation play precise owner hope starter find tailor antonio game blueprint succeed discipline loss weapon elusiveness stuff laugh include adjustment coordinator inconsistency illustration linemen regard,0.9948,0.3403933434190619,8.152160611854683,0.4471499690785405,0,2023-12-04

Washington Post,"Once again, the 49ers are playing like the NFC’s best team",2023-12-04 07:47:00,Mark Maske,"PHILADELPHIA — The San Francisco 49ers were quite a bit more competitive at Lincoln Financial Field with a functional quarterback, as it turns out.They were dominant, in fact.And the race for the top seed in the NFC playoffs, as a result, no longer is a runaway by the Philadelphia Eagles.The Niners still do not have the conference’s best record. They have not played consistently like a superteam throughout the season. But they certainly did on Sunday in Philadelphia as they won a testy rematch of last season’s NFC championship game. The 49ers overcame a sluggish beginning to score touchdowns on six straight drives and overwhelmed the Eagles, 42-19.“I had full confidence that we would have this type of game from the jump,” Niners standout left tackle Trent Williams said. “We’ve got our quarterback. So it made it a lot easier this time.”It was a heated game that included 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw being ejected for a third-quarter confrontation along the sideline with Eagles security staffer Dom DiSandro following a play. But it also was a showcase of just how good the Niners can be.“It means a lot,” 49ers star pass rusher Nick Bosa said. “Obviously we wanted some payback. We tried not to think too much about last year. But we knew we could match up with them and more than that. So I think we proved a good point. Obviously, we might have to do it again against them. They’re a really good team. But I just have so much confidence in everybody. … Nobody needs to be the guy. There’s 20 guys who could be the guy. It just depends when your moment comes that you’re ready for it.”The Niners had more than 10 months to stew about their 31-7 defeat Jan. 29 on the same field in the NFC title game. Quarterback Brock Purdy suffered an elbow injury on the 49ers’ opening offensive possession of that game that required offseason surgery. He was forced to return to the game, even while being virtually unable to throw, after backup Josh Johnson suffered a concussion in the third quarter. Tailback Christian McCaffrey even took a late-game turn at quarterback that day.“It was sort of in my mind, yeah, I got hurt here … this year, late in January,” Purdy said Sunday. “But was it going to be the revenge game or anything like that? No. For me, it was Week 13. We’re going into a whole new year, a hostile environment. We needed this game. … I didn’t want to get distracted by, ‘I’ve got to go back and show everybody what could have happened or what could have been.’ ”It was a highly successful return for Purdy, who had four touchdown passes in a 19-for-27, 314-yard passing show.“I don’t think the emotions were there like you would think,” Niners Coach Kyle Shanahan said. “I mean, I think if we would have opened up in Week 1 here, I think that would have been a real big deal. But just, I think, going through the season, [Purdy has] played a lot of football. His arm’s felt great. So I think coming back here, the emotions are more about going against such a good team and playing in such a hard place to play.”Purdy had plenty of help. Wide receiver Deebo Samuel had four catches for 116 yards and two touchdowns. He also provided a rushing touchdown. McCaffrey ran for 93 yards and a touchdown.“Outside of those first two drives, it’s like: That’s the Niner football that we know,” Purdy said. “That’s the offense that we know, when everyone’s doing their part. Everything’s clicking, obviously. Some great play calls. And then everyone just makes plays and does it the right way. We protect the ball. The defense does their job. That felt good. That’s what we’re always trying to obviously do and be at. That’s the standard that we know.”The 49ers went three plays and out and punted on each of their first two offensive possessions of the day. The Eagles dominated the game’s early going. But they managed only two field goals and led by only 6-0. From there, the Niners got moving. They had touchdown drives of 85, 90, 75, 77, 75 and 48 yards on their next six drives.“Our whole offense, everybody settled down,” Shanahan said. “Which included Brock, too, and myself.”The 49ers, at 9-3, pulled to within one game of the Eagles, who dropped to 10-2, in the chase for the No. 1 seed.“We understand how good that team is,” Shanahan said. “We understand their record. And so that makes it always a little bit bigger. Our guys were really excited for the challenge. And when you come out with that much energy and ready to go and things don’t go well for a quarter, that was the thing I was most proud of. Our guys were able to able to weather the storm.”Samuel’s three-touchdown performance came after he said last week he had no regrets about calling Eagles cornerback James Bradberry “trash” in the aftermath of the NFC championship game loss.“They beat us in the NFC championship,” Samuel said Sunday. “We wanted to get [them] back. But at the end of the day, it’s just football. We’re talking trash, having fun and just came out here and got a win.”The Eagles had been living dangerously without faltering, until Sunday. This was their fifth straight game in which they trailed at halftime. They’d come back to win the previous four times.Not Sunday.Quarterback Jalen Hurts left the field to be evaluated under the NFL concussion protocols but returned to the game. He played reasonably well, throwing for 298 yards and a touchdown. He also had a rushing touchdown. Wide receiver A.J. Brown had eight catches for 114 yards. Wideout DeVonta Smith had nine catches for 96 yards. But the Eagles could not keep pace.And now, suddenly, they lead the Dallas Cowboys by only one game in the NFC East. They’ll face the Cowboys next Sunday night in Arlington, Tex.“This is about playing to the standard,” Hurts said, “and we didn’t play to the standard. … It’s a great team we played, and we have to go back and reflect on it.”The 49ers resembled the NFL’s best team when they opened the season with five impressive victories. But then they had to deal with injuries to McCaffrey, Samuel and Williams. Purdy struggled a bit, finally resembling the final player chosen in last year’s NFL draft rather than the league MVP candidate he so quickly has become. The Niners suffered through a three-game losing streak.But they’ve gotten healthy. They added Chase Young as a pass-rushing complement to Bosa in a trade-deadline deal with the Washington Commanders. They are on a four-game winning streak. And they have reminded everyone that, when they’re at full strength, they just may be the NFL’s most talented and complete team.The NFC playoffs could be interesting indeed, even if the Eagles regroup and manage to ensure the conference’s postseason road to the Super Bowl goes through Philadelphia again.",6721,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/49ers-nfc-best-eagles/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,wideout eject washington smith knew guy remind suffer mind hurt offense impressive devonta big disandro elbow arm opening plenty goal return virtually offseason purdy ran finally johnson backup sideline possession manage falter top nick standard trash cornerback call back dallas make kyle lead dominate sort moment early testy draft resemble bradberry streak defense quarterback excite showcase punt drive linebacker dominant force heat consistently felt left wide jump revenge match point throw week young quarter quickly pull injury seed james arlington staffer emotion click day record nfl player drop bit season begin happen living ball straight yard evaluate strength provide financial proud real late talk josh lot williams football trent indeed hostile complement part tailback understand touchdown defeat struggle star chase francisco fun jalen rush championship passing conference regret confrontation samuel regroup aftermath brock dre field ensure full ready stew easy hard commander protect successful protocol prove bosa complete payback brown place highly settle cowboy greenlaw security turn bowl win result overcame challenge race confidence offensive suddenly depends environment year san move eagle lincoln final receiver dangerously weather super team energy add philadelphia standout catch chosen healthy score pass shanahan deal require reflect surgery functional rusher distract sunday job night playoff christian postseason coach talented road sluggish nfc played halftime deebo runaway great mvp january overwhelmed niner longer play rematch lose month league show type dom game trail follow unable previous victory competitive performance beat include superteam open candidate east title concussion tackle mccaffrey interest,0.98275,0.0446362148489808,5.422630480167012,0.4213052632233665,0,2023-12-04

Washington Post,The Caps found their ‘best line.’ Now they might have to break it up.,2023-12-04 06:00:00,Bailey Johnson,"TEMPE, Ariz. — Anthony Mantha has five goals and two assists in 17 games for the Washington Capitals. All seven of those Capitals goals were scored when the winger was on the ice with Connor McMichael or Aliaksei Protas, and five of them came with the trio skating together as a line.On this five-game road trip, McMichael centering Mantha and Protas has been Washington’s most consistently dangerous line — and it isn’t particularly close. They created both goals in a 2-1 win at the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday: McMichael set up Mantha for the first after Protas sprung them for a two-on-one, and Mantha’s shot created a rebound for McMichael on the second.Then Mantha opened the scoring in a 5-4 win at the Anaheim Ducks on Thursday, and though the goal officially was unassisted, it came at the end of an impactful shift by all three forwards.“That whole line — Mo, Mikey, Pro — I feel like that’s been our best line, hands down,” Coach Spencer Carbery said before Saturday’s 4-1 loss at Vegas. “… Offensively, that line is rolling. There’s some things they’re doing inside of their shifts that are really helping them from a puck support standpoint — moving their feet, all these different areas, reading off each other. And they’re controlling play and keeping pucks alive in the offensive zone.”According to Natural Stat Trick, only two of Washington’s lines have scored five goals together at even strength. One is Dylan Strome centering Alex Ovechkin and Tom Wilson, who have played together for just shy of 100 minutes across 11 games. The other is Mantha, McMichael and Protas, who have matched that line’s production in half as many minutes.“We’re kind of learning where the other guys are going to be on the ice and their habits,” Mantha said after practice Sunday in Arizona. “Pro’s winning his battles. Mikey’s winning his battles. I’m winning my battles. It’s just good support all around. ... I think that’s important for us. Obviously, the best defense is offense. We just want to play with the puck, create a lot offensively, and it’s going well for us so far.”They first found success together in an overtime loss to Florida on Nov. 8, when Mantha scored two goals — one set up by Protas and the other by McMichael. But Mantha left that game early after being hit in the left ear by a deflected shot — the impact ruptured his eardrum, and his hearing has yet to fully return — and it took them several games to be reunited once Mantha returned.Their first game back together came in Los Angeles, and the impact was immediate. Mantha is nearly halfway to the 11 goals he scored in 67 games last year, and he credited the play of his linemates for his recent success.“I think it’s just me being more involved, winning my battles one-on-one,” he said. “Playing with the puck a little bit more, controlling it. My lineys are playing really well. We’re playing connected. We’re playing close to each other. I think that’s what’s making our success.”For a team that has been seeking offensive chemistry all season, finding an impactful trio is a massive lift. But McMichael, Protas and Mantha’s consistency as a line is also the biggest threat to them continuing to play together.Late in Saturday’s game, as the Capitals sputtered to a 4-1 loss to the Golden Knights, McMichael was elevated to play between Ovechkin and Wilson, while Strome centered Protas and Mantha. McMichael’s success had earned him a promotion, but the move took him from the place where he found success.“They have carried play, been a productive line from an analytics standpoint, from a numbers standpoint, and produced offensively,” Carbery said Sunday. “Scored some big, big goals for us. You like that. But now, you pull Mikey away, and now you’re robbing Peter to pay Paul. We’re trying to figure that out.”Carbery hinted that the lines from the end of the Vegas game could remain in place for the Capitals’ final game of their road trip Monday at the Arizona Coyotes. Even though he believes Protas, McMichael and Mantha have been Washington’s best trio, a need for more production from the top of the lineup might force Carbery into keeping them split up — at least for the time being.“We’re still looking for some combinations. I know I’ve said this for 21 games,” Carbery said. “We’re still looking for some line combinations. We feel like we might’ve found something with [the Mantha-McMichael-Protas] line. [Nic Dowd], obviously, [has] his line. And then we’re looking for those other six and figuring what that looks like. Whether it’s a mix of O, Strome, [Evgeny] Kuznetsov, [Sonny] Milano — where does it all fit? Can we find a combination that can give us some consistently positive minutes? That’s just what we haven’t found.”",4733,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/capitals-anthony-mantha-connor-mcmichael-aliaksei-protas/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,washington control center guy mix earn milano offense fully big number coyote productive feel goal return figure dylan carry foot top lineup impact hit back make eardrum sonny stat early overtime half kind defense shot positive force consistently thursday left success wilson standpoint close give connect knight ovechkin golden sputter shy tom match rebound massive linemates lift set ear pull carbery halfway learn florida deflect bit season remain inside split strength time hearing lot king impactful hand mantha protas accord production found paul reading dowd chemistry duck winger line trio different away promotion place alive vega sprung unassisted seek pro angeles win believe combination aliaksei involve pay connor offensive trick continue alex tempe year minute reunite roll mcmichael move offensively produce final credit natural recent team area nic analytics evgeny elevate anthony score trip saturday monday sunday particularly support road coach anaheim rupture played battle lineys rob strome officially create practice spencer play arizona wednesday mo assist find habit threat game ice consistency hint dangerous puck loss kuznetsov immediate fit open important mikey shift skate capital,0.9749,0.1267694908092119,5.952547076313181,0.4116088420436246,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,What to know from NFL Week 13: Jordan Love carries Packers to contention,2023-12-04 06:00:00,Adam Kilgore,"Week 13 prompted questions big and small. Can anybody beat the 49ers? (Probably not.) Are you prepared to live in a world with three AFC South playoff teams? (It’s possible.) Wait a second, is that Joe Flacco? (Yup, add another name to the quarterbacks-who-have-started-for-Cleveland list.) Here is what to know.The Packers are probably making the playoffs. Back in training camp, Green Bay Coach Matt LaFleur sat on a couch in his office and dismissed the idea of a rebuild in the season after Aaron Rodgers departed. “I never give two seconds of thought to that,” LaFleur said. “We have a job to do. At the end of the day, nobody cares. This league is about winning.”Four months later, after a rough early stretch, the Packers are winning behind Jordan Love. Green Bay received help at the end Sunday night when an egregious pass interference penalty went uncalled. But the Packers were the better team all night in their 27-19 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs at Lambeau Field. Love continued his second-half ascension, playing a nearly perfect game as he passed for 267 yards and three touchdowns, operating Green Bay’s offense with total control and limiting Patrick Mahomes’s Chiefs to seven drives.Having beaten the Chargers, Lions and Chiefs in consecutive weeks, the Packers are playing as well as any NFC team outside of San Francisco. They hold the NFC’s final wild-card spot, winning a tiebreaker in a four-way bunch of 6-6 teams. (The Packers and Vikings are in; the Rams and Seahawks are out.) The Packers do not play another game against an opponent currently with a winning record, their toughest game coming at the quarterback-challenged Vikings in Week 17.The playoffs this year may feel like a bonus in Green Bay, where Love and his confluence of first- and second-year wide receivers have made the future bright. Love has established himself as a viable successor to Rodgers and Brett Favre over the past month, and Green Bay’s young wide receivers have grown with him. The Packers’ plan is coming together.Kyle Shanahan is painting his masterpiece. Shanahan has long established himself as one of the best coaches in the NFL, and at 43 he has a chance to be an all-timer. In the past four seasons, the 49ers have been to the Super Bowl and two other NFC championship games. But Shanahan has never had a team like the one currently throttling the rest of the NFL, and it’s possible he never will again.On Sunday in Philadelphia, the 49ers left no doubt about which team is the Super Bowl favorite. In a 42-19 victory, they stripped the Eagles and sold them for parts, scoring touchdowns on six consecutive possessions starting in the second quarter. The 49ers have played three teams with at least eight victories — the Jaguars, Cowboys and Eagles — and have beaten them by a combined score of 118-32.The 49ers operate on a different plane because no team has a better constellation of playmakers and no coach is better at designing an offense than Shanahan. The versatility and skill of Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, Brandon Aiyuk and George Kittle allow Shanahan to stretch the defense until it breaks. Brock Purdy has the accuracy and quick decision-making to execute Shanahan’s designs. The 49ers are playing offensive football at a level rarely reached.This is the year for Shanahan to break through and win his first Super Bowl. He was the Falcons’ offensive coordinator when they blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl, and he held a 10-point lead midway through the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl four years ago before Mahomes launched an epic comeback. The stakes for Shanahan are becoming clear: This will be his signature season — or another year that ends in heartbreak.The Colts? The Colts. Two months ago, Indianapolis appeared headed for a season in limbo. Rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson, chosen fourth in April’s draft, underwent season-ending surgery to repair a shoulder injury. The Colts lost their next three games. They had a rookie coach (Shane Steichen), a stopgap quarterback (Gardner Minshew II), a dearth of star players and nearly $50 million in salary cap dead space. It appeared this would be a transition year — and probably an ugly one.Now, it might end in the playoffs. The Colts won their fourth straight game Sunday, stealing a 31-28 overtime victory from the Tennessee Titans after Minshew hit Alec Pierce for 55 yards down the sideline, then threaded a four-yard pass to Michael Pittman Jr. in the back of the end zone. At 7-5, the Colts hold a wild-card spot in the AFC.It’s not obvious how they are doing this. Their point differential is plus-4, and they entered Sunday both allowing and gaining 5.2 yards per play. They are middle-of-the-pack in most every important statistical category. Minshew is a credible backup, especially when he’s not turning the ball over, and Zack Moss has been a great find at running back. Pittman, who caught 11 passes for 105 yards Sunday, is emerging as a legitimate No. 1 wideout.Credit belongs to Steichen, who came to Indianapolis after calling plays for the Eagles. The Colts consistently use smart game plans that attack the defense’s weaknesses. They snuffed out two punts Sunday, taking one back for a touchdown — a sign of the coaching staff finding and using every possible advantage.The Colts’ remaining schedule — Bengals, Steelers, Falcons, Raiders, Texans — is manageable and provides multiple showdowns with wild-card competitors. They’ll be a factor until the end, which nobody would have seen coming even a few weeks ago.The Lions’ defense makes them a cut below. All week, Detroit Coach Dan Campbell repeated that he had no reason to panic. The Lions had played consecutive subpar games, squeaking out a victory over the Bears after a furious comeback and losing at home to the Packers on Thanksgiving. Campbell insisted they would be fine if they just stopped committing turnovers, seven of which they had given away over two weeks.The Lions did not turn the ball over in their 33-28 victory over the New Orleans Saints, but it didn’t quell the concerns. They don’t need to apologize for winning on the road, but they need to fix their defense if they want to threaten the heavyweights of the NFC. In consecutive games, the Lions have surrendered 38, 26, 29 and 28 points to opponents with losing records. Their secondary is particularly vulnerable; the Saints’ passing game is anemic, and Derek Carr passed New Orleans back into the game after the Lions built a 21-0 lead.Dak Prescott could be the MVP. No quarterback in the NFL is passing better than Prescott, who threw for 299 yards as the Cowboys outdueled the Seahawks, 41-35, on Thursday night. Over his past six games, Prescott has 20 touchdown passes and just two interceptions while averaging 317 yards. He is in total command of the Dallas offense, leaning on star wideout CeeDee Lamb while still spreading the ball around. For an award that hinges on storylines, it helps to be the quarterback of the Cowboys. But Prescott is throwing his way into the MVP race on merit. He is fifth in passing yards, second in passer rating and fourth in yards per attempt.There may be an opening at the top of the MVP discussion. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, the front-runner entering Sunday, posted pedestrian numbers during Philadelphia’s blowout loss to San Francisco. Prescott will have every chance to replace Hurts as the favorite in the coming weeks.The Cowboys have built their 9-3 record on a soft schedule, but their next four games are against the Eagles, Bills, Dolphins and Lions. Next week, the Cowboys can tie the Eagles atop the NFC East with a victory. If Prescott plays well enough to win two or three of his next four games — especially if the Cowboys can knock off the Eagles — he’ll probably surge to the lead in the MVP race. Prescott’s performance, his centrality to his team’s success and his statistics would make him a worthy choice.The Texans are more than C.J. Stroud. First the bad news: Wide receiver Tank Dell suffered a broken fibula that will cut short his remarkable rookie season. Dell had been one of the most thrilling wideouts in the NFL, rookie or otherwise, and losing him puts a harder ceiling on Houston’s season.Still, even without Dell, the Texans snapped the Broncos’ five-game winning streak with a 22-17 victory. Nico Collins replaced Dell’s production, catching nine passes for 191 yards and a touchdown. But Houston’s victory, which pushed its record to 7-5, was built mostly on defense.It’s not a surprise that the Texans’ defense would improve during its first season under Coach DeMeco Ryans, who had been one of the best defensive coordinators in the NFL. The Texans’ future stars are starting to play like present stars. Rookie Will Anderson Jr., whom Houston traded up to draft third, recorded his first two-sack game Sunday, giving him four sacks in the past five weeks. Cornerback Derek Stingley Jr., the third pick in 2022, intercepted two passes, giving him picks in three straight weeks. In a play that was impressive and symbolic, Anderson tipped a Russell Wilson pass that redirected into Stingley’s arms.It couldn’t have gotten worse for Pittsburgh. The Steelers lost their quarterback and their best player to injuries, got shoved around at home by a 2-10 team, lost a game that included two lengthy weather delays and ended 4 hours 20 minutes after kickoff, and nearly fell out of playoff position. “That was a horrible day at the office,” Coach Mike Tomlin said. At least the Andy Warhol Museum didn’t fall into the Allegheny.It would have been a surprise result no matter the tenor, but the thoroughness of the Cardinals’ 24-10 victory was shocking. Former Steeler James Conner ran for 105 yards, grinding the Steelers as the Cardinals held the ball for the final four-plus minutes. The Steelers failed to convert fourth and goal from the 1 in the second quarter, and the Cardinals replied with a 99-yard touchdown drive before halftime. The momentum Pittsburgh’s offense gathered last week in its first game with a new play-calling brain trust evaporated. With a minus-37 point differential, the Steelers are a mediocre team.It was one of the ugliest losses of Tomlin’s tenure, and the result may not have been the worst part. Quarterback Kenny Pickett left in the first half with an ankle injury after taking a hellacious hit near the goal line, and superstar pass rusher T.J. Watt entered the medical tent and ended the game on the sideline.Pittsburgh dropped to 7-5, in a four-way tie with the Colts, Texans and Browns for the AFC’s three wild-card spots. (The Texans are currently the odd team out.) If the Steelers don’t play better, the playoffs will be a fantasy by the end of December. They next play Thursday against the lowly Patriots, who are coming off an ungodly offensive performance in a 6-0 loss to the Chargers. But once you lose by two touchdowns to the Cardinals, no outcome can be taken for granted.Mike Evans keeps on ticking. This year seemed like a prime season for Evans to start declining. Wide receivers tend to age quickly once they hit 30. In the preseason, he was unhappy that the Buccaneers did not give him a new contract. He had a new quarterback, Baker Mayfield. The Buccaneers were entering a rebuild after maxing out their salary cap to chase Super Bowls with Tom Brady.On the field, though, nothing has changed for Evans, who remains a model of consistent excellence. He caught seven passes for 162 yards Sunday, giving him 1,012 receiving yards on the season. He has surpassed 1,000 yards in all 10 years of his career. Ten seasons with 1,000 yards ties Randy Moss for second most ever; only Jerry Rice, who did it 14 times, has more.",11713,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/packers-chiefs-kyle-shanahan-49ers-eagles/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,anderson jerry successor versatility enter offense impressive steichen salary past conner opening category feel tend change goal purdy stretch threw squeak unhappy interception momentum backup put moss pittman possession especially top call back push michael obvious fix playmaker jaguar rarely bear evaporate sell early draft streak strip delay defense blowout quarterback redirect punt surge gather drive ugly head hold toughest consistently mike continued thursday interference surrender wilson convert outcome cap give thoroughness mayfield wide atop fell reason contract threaten replace week green rating remains outdueled long quarter quickly stake surpass camp future ryans tomlin james built million ceiling defensive probably differential seahawks nfl player fourth remain rice present grind lambeau wait transition uncalled superstar carr bill news preseason midway bengal secondary schedule level football thanksgiving surprise repeat part skill randy fail belongs wideouts star hinge masterpiece francisco indianapolis smart odd stop packer favorite design brock april warhol career field statistic accuracy sack orleans line stopgap consistent away brown manageable dismiss lion ceedee perfect doubt turn bowl win result home egregious receive offensive race rodgers worthy year sat detroit aaron spot prescott knock confluence richardson flacco super multiple trust love cardinal pass shanahan brain space rusher soft anemic currently job comeback steal particularly quell christian dearth hellacious matt tank pick matter halftime afc great subpar mvp steeler play position ungodly list league game shane december age baker victory launch performance quick include snap east joe former emerge dead george statistical limit credible mccaffrey mediocre wideout snuffed falcon control concern lean prime epic suffer hurt vulnerable viable big south number showdown tent operate ran kittle turnover live underwent sideline ram command held cornerback ten rebuild furious rookie hit dallas dolphin make lead establish staff merit improve excellence remarkable overtime andy pickett half execute tie heavyweight ankle shoulder centrality prepared commit discussion alec houston left ascension consecutive legitimate bright thread cut lamb success charger small clear bonus shock tom plan point weakness throw tipped young beaten panic intercept gardner injury colt buccaneer run pierce day record jordan possible training start nico drop office passer medical season minshew grown shove caught ball yard straight provide time combine ago world viking zone harder thrill symbolic factor idea attack tenor rest touchdown production post raider horrible chase jalen question brett constellation spread championship passing trade reply stroud break samuel fine average campbell repair city collins patriot storyline different blew cowboy demeco derek tick operating chief prompt lengthy opponent titan russell broken bay fibula minute throttle san hour fantasy limbo eagle brandon final receiver favre weather tiebreaker patrick team add philadelphia catch couch total anthony chosen kenny pedestrian lowly watt saint score texan tennessee surgery ugliest sunday bronco night fall signature depart aiyuk rough playoff chance painting coach road nfc played deebo mahomes award zack short apologize lose month model pittsburgh tenure find plane steelers sign museum evans stingley loss decline beat important coordinator penalty maxing competitor bunch lafleur kickoff insist kansa,0.71155,0.2817382395628788,8.106760316066723,0.4277260437974724,1,2023-12-04
Washington Post,NBA in-season tournament brings elimination games in December,2023-12-04 05:30:00,Ben Golliver,"The NBA’s inaugural in-season tournament will take center stage this week, when the league has cleared its schedule for four days to showcase the event’s knockout round.After a round-robin group stage trimmed the field from 30 teams to eight, the single-elimination quarterfinals will take place Monday and Tuesday. The four winners of the quarterfinal games will then advance to T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas for Thursday’s semifinals and Saturday’s championship. In addition to $500,000 bonuses for each player on the winning team, the champions will take home the NBA Cup and bragging rights as the tournament’s first winner.The knockout round field features blue bloods such as the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics as well as superstar headliners in LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo, but several small-market underdogs loom as potential spoilers. Here’s a game-by-game preview of the quarterfinals, which will be televised by TNT.All times Eastern.Boston Celtics (15-4) at Indiana Pacers (10-8): 7:30 p.m. MondayThe quarterfinal round’s juicy opener pits the NBA’s most dominant team (Boston with a plus-9.5 net rating) against the league’s most potent attack (Indiana with a 123.8 offensive rating). While Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and the Celtics have reached the Eastern Conference finals in four of the past six seasons, their title hopes remain unfulfilled because they have come undone with turnovers and stilted flow in late-game situations. For that reason, the in-season tournament could help Boston get over the hump in clutch moments or further long-standing concerns about their chemistry and mettle. The Celtics will be without center Kristaps Porzingis, who has been sidelined since Nov. 26 with a calf injury.While Tatum entered the season as a strong MVP candidate, Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton has been making his own case to enter the conversation. The fourth-year point guard is averaging 27 points and a league-best 11.8 assists while directing the NBA’s fastest and highest-scoring offense. Even so, the Celtics are the deeper and more experienced team, and they should be favored to advance after exploiting the Pacers’ poor defense during a 155-104 victory in Boston on Nov. 1.Indiana claimed home-court advantage by going 4-0 in the group stage, but it’s worth noting that the Celtics have a better record on the road (6-4) than the Pacers have at Gainbridge Fieldhouse (6-5). Boston also went 6-3 on the road in last year’s playoffs.New Orleans Pelicans (11-10) at Sacramento Kings (11-7): 10 p.m. MondayDon’t be surprised if the least glitzy of the four quarterfinal games winds up being the most entertaining. Sacramento and New Orleans can both claim they’re better than their records: The Kings went 2-3 when star guard De’Aaron Fox was sidelined by an ankle injury in November, and the Pelicans have gone 1-3 without Zion Williamson while also juggling the longer-term absences of Trey Murphy and CJ McCollum. Nevertheless, both teams seem poised to compete for one of the West’s six guaranteed playoff spots.The Pelicans scored two home victories over the Kings in November, but Sacramento went 4-0 in the group stage and will host Monday’s game at Golden 1 Center, where it is 6-2 this season. After helping snap the Kings’ 16-year playoff drought last season, Fox is averaging a career-high 30.3 points and all-star center Domantas Sabonis is adding 18.6 points and 11.8 rebounds per game. The Kings’ defense still leaves something to be desired, but it has improved from 24th last season to 19th this season.Williamson’s stellar start for New Orleans hasn’t gotten enough attention, perhaps because recurring injury issues limited the 2019 No. 1 pick to just 104 games during his first four seasons. Regardless, the bruising forward applies immense pressure to opposing defenses in the paint, and he has been a more willing distributor this season. That growth has helped New Orleans go 7-2 in his past nine appearances.“I don’t think we have a ceiling,” Williamson said after a recent road win over the Los Angeles Clippers. “We’re just trying to become one of those championship-contending teams.”New York Knicks (12-7) at Milwaukee Bucks (14-6): 7:30 p.m. TuesdayThe Bucks hold big edges in star power and offensive firepower over the Knicks thanks to Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard, but they have been arguably the NBA’s most enigmatic contender. After years of elite defenses under longtime coach Mike Budenholzer, Milwaukee has dropped to 21st in defensive efficiency during Adrian Griffin’s first year at the helm. Without a reliable defensive identity, the Bucks suffered some ugly early-season losses and have regularly played down to lesser competition.But it’s not all bad news: Milwaukee is 9-3 in games that were within five points in the final five minutes, and Lillard leads the NBA with 67 points in clutch situations. The shaky late-game execution that doomed the Bucks in their first-round loss to the Heat last year has been replaced by a more diverse and decisive closing attack that could certainly prove useful in a single-elimination setting.New York, meanwhile, hasn’t changed its formula much since it won its first playoff series in a decade in April: Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle continue to drive an unspectacular offense, while Coach Tom Thibodeau presides over a top-five defense.The Bucks and Knicks both advanced to the quarterfinals from East Group B, and Milwaukee secured home-court advantage Tuesday with a 110-105 home victory over New York on Nov. 3. That victory could pay dividends because Milwaukee is 9-1 at Fiserv Forum and hasn’t lost at home since the opening week of the season.Phoenix Suns (12-8) at Los Angeles Lakers (12-9): 10 p.m. TuesdayWhen the NBA conceived the in-season tournament, pitting James against Durant in a do-or-die matchup had to be the dream. The two basketball legends played four elimination games during their three Finals matchups, evenly splitting those contests with two wins apiece. While Tuesday’s stakes will be considerably lower, James and Durant can be counted on to bring their best.“At some point, y’all non athletes [are going to] realize that friends compete harder against one another,” Durant wrote on social media alongside a photograph of him and James smiling.The Lakers scored wins over the Suns on Oct. 26 and Nov. 10 this season, but Durant went for 39 points and 38 points in defeat. Both games were memorable: The first was their first regular season matchup since Christmas 2018, and the second helped Los Angeles clinch West Group A with a 4-0 record. The Lakers are 8-2 at home and just 4-7 on the road this season, so they will be glad to play host at Crypto.com Arena.",6733,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/nba-in-season-tournament-quarterfinals/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,randle net concern center medium nba suffer enter offense hump social sacramento juicy bring clipper big blood preview past edge opening quarterfinal stellar potent claimed change calf considerably note turnover poise spoiler sideline potential headliner distributor knockout conceive bragging make event conversation legend gainbridge growth power lead attention moment zion tuesday firepower improve presides pelican b pressure tuesdaythe host entertain secure ankle defense situation showcase alongside drive recur ugly dominant friend identity stage oppose heat hold mike televise thursday blue clear bonus golden murphy reason helm tom kevin pacer series point replace arguably rebound week rating stilted execution stake injury memorable james tyrese york glitzy day regular lakers ceiling defensive damian record diverse fox immense start player drop season remain mccollum glad porzingis champion lesser matchup compete superstar deeper time basketball giannis shaky news harder guaranteed flow schedule king unspectacular attack juggling jayson enigmatic regularly count knicks tatum experienced defeat pit star jaylen eastern jalen realize championship issue conference chemistry round average formula april splitting advantage field kristaps group decisive orleans prove advanced semifinal fast brown undone place vega closing angeles athlete fieldhouse underdog win write home mondaydon thibodeau williamson advance strong pay paint drought offensive continue efficiency dream worth tournament year minute sabonis aaron dividend celtic feature antetokounmpo clinch lillard christmas loom reach final evenly poor absence sun adrian elite exploit recent team mettle apiece add fiserv case winner score trim saturday monday longtime wind low milwaukee surprised limited direct contender forward playoff road photograph coach guard boston played pick mvp bruising unfulfilled elimination doom play decade applies lose league favor hope clutch opener assist domantas cj game brunson november buck griffin tuesdaywhen victory forum reliable loss leaf contest julius west budenholzer desire cup snap candidate east trey title addition inaugural indiana arena mondaythe claim haliburton lebron,0.97745,0.0445566612208525,10.134536741214056,0.4108700162271591,0,2023-12-04
USA TODAY,32 things we learned from NFL Week 13: Why miss out on the playoff controversy fun?,2023-12-04 05:17:57,Nate Davis,"The 32 things we learned from Week 13 of the 2023 NFL season: 1. Sunday was a wild affair in the football universe, starting early with the controversial announcement of the College Football Playoff field. Thank the pigskin gods that the NFL’s postseason bracket isn’t constructed so, uh, subjectively? Nevertheless, it makes for a fun thought exercise regarding how that might work in 2023, given eight teams entered Week 13 with at least eight victories – suggesting the pros, as with the college ranks, have an unusual number of bona fide contenders this year. 2. Put the San Francisco 49ers No. 1 in my NFL CFP after they dismembered the Philadelphia Eagles 42-19 at Lincoln Financial Field in a much-hyped – if highly disappointing – rematch of last season’s NFC championship game. 3. Philly holds a 50-49 scoring advantage in a pair of games that were expected to be quite close and compelling … but neither was. 4. Niners QB Brock Purdy may well have bypassed Eagles QB Jalen Hurts in the MVP race after throwing for 314 yards and four TDs on Sunday. Of course, Purdy’s elbow injury in the NFC title game was the point where San Francisco’s Super Bowl hopes – at least for the 2022 season – evaporated. 5. The 49ers improved to 9-1 this season in games when WR Deebo Samuel has played, the lone loss coming at Cleveland when a shoulder injury knocked him out. Sunday, the trash-talking Samuel backed up the yak with 138 yards from scrimmage and three TDs. 6. San Francisco RB Christian McCaffrey’s 2-yard TD run made him the third player in NFL history with 50 TDs on the ground and 25 more via reception. He joins Hall of Famers Lenny Moore and Marshall Faulk. 7. Rough afternoon for the Eagles, yet they still qualify for this NFL CFP – their 10-2 record remaining the league’s best … even if they failed to join the 1972-73 Miami Dolphins as the only clubs to win at least 11 of their first 12 games in successive seasons. 8. Matters may not improve in Week 14 for the reigning NFC champs, who visit the Dallas Cowboys for “Sunday Night Football.” Lose that game, and Philly surrenders first place in the NFC East to “America’s Team,” which has won 14 in a row at AT&T Stadium 9. But after facing Dallas, Philadelphia isn’t currently scheduled to face another team with a winning record for the remainder of the regular season. 10. And the Eagles still have chief security officer Dom DiSandro. You don't. 11. Philadelphia and the Denver Broncos, who entered Week 13 as the NFL’s hottest teams, both saw their five-game winning streaks snapped. 12. Speaking of the Cowboys, would you put them in the NFL CFP? After all, they don’t currently own a win against a team with a winning record – though that’s only true because they knocked the Seattle Seahawks from 6-5 to 6-6 after Thursday night’s 41-35 roller coaster. 13. But, hey, we’re including “Dem Boyz” amid QB Dak Prescott’s MVP-caliber play – which has helped WR CeeDee Lamb evolve into an All-Pro-caliber weapon – and a defense that’s so often dominant and racks up splash plays left and right. 14. I acknowledge no AFC teams have yet been picked for this NFL CFP – my committee and rules, not yours. But an invite will be issued to the defending Super Bowl-champion Kansas City Chiefs. Anyone else going to bring Taylor Swift to the party and drive up our ratings? 14a. And Sunday night's loss to the officiating-assisted Green Bay Packers does not sway that decision. 15. The Dolphins, quite likely the league’s most explosive team, seem like the odd team out in this scenario – essentially because they’ve beaten up on non-Power Five teams but haven’t hung with the elite. The Fins did improve to 9-3 for the first time since 2001 on Sunday, when they lashed the Washington Commanders 45-15, and now sit atop the overall AFC standings. 16. Miami WR Tyreek Hill finished with five catches for 157 yards and two TDs. His league-leading 1,481 receiving yards are the most ever through a dozen games during the Super Bowl era (since 1966). 17. The “Cheetah,” who has expressed his desire to become the first 2,000-yard receiver in NFL history, is now on pace for 2,098. 18. Huge game in Houston on Sunday, the Texans roping the Broncos in a game that could determine which of these teams qualifies for a “New Year's Six,” er, playoff spot. 19. Denver, which entered Sunday converting nearly 39% of its third downs, went 0-for-11 … though it must be noted Denver was perfect on three fourth-down attempts. 20. Of more importance, a Broncos defense that had 15 takeaways over its previous four games didn’t get one from Houston. 21. However the Texans suffered a major blow, rookie WR Tank Dell going down with a season-ending ankle/fibula injury. 22. Congratulations to Mike Evans. On Sunday, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Pro Bowler became the first player in NFL history to start a career with 10 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons. 22a. Evans’ seven grabs for 162 yards and a score were pretty much the difference in the Bucs’ 21-18 win over the Carolina Panthers, who remain stuck on one win even after the ouster of coach Frank Reich. 23. Congratulations to James Conner. The Arizona Cardinals may not have much left to play for in 2023, but he was scintillating – 105 yards, 2 TDs rushing Sunday – in his return to Pittsburgh, where he overcame cancer while playing for the Pitt Panthers and later starred for the Steelers, who drafted him in 2017. 24. New Orleans Saints QB Derek Carr is dealing with shoulder, back and concussion issues and has now failed to finish three games this season – his new team falling a full game behind the first-place Atlanta Falcons in the NFC South standings after Sunday’s loss to the Detroit Lions. 25. The NFC North-leading Lions’ 9-3 record represents their best start since 1962. 26. Saints RB Alvin Kamara scored his 52nd and 53rd career rushing TDs on Sunday, breaking Mark Ingram’s franchise record. 27. Looks like the Jets players are doing everything they can to ensure QB Aaron Rodgers doesn’t rush back from his Achilles injury … and even GM Joe Douglas didn’t bother to re-sign Joe Flacco. 28. Speaking of Flacco, he passed for 254 yards and two TDs for the Cleveland Browns, who lost Sunday to the resurgent Los Angeles Rams. Still, think the Jets coulda maybe used that kind of production from the Super Bowl 47 MVP? 29. Three days after the Cowboys and Seahawks combined for zero punts – just the fifth time that had happened in NFL regular-season history – the Los Angeles Chargers and New England Patriots teamed up for 15 in the Bolts’ 6-0, uh, victory. 29a. But give credit to Chargers P JK Scott, who was a bona fide weapon amid Gillette Stadium’s miserably rainy conditions. Still, Scott landed seven of his eight kicks inside New England’s 20-yard line in a game defined by field position. 30. The Patriots have suffered multiple home shutouts in a season for the first time in their almost 64-year existence. 31. Game of the day? Not 49ers-Eagles, y’all. We’re talking about the one which the nation just couldn’t wait to see: Colts-Titans. Indianapolis beat Tennessee 31-28 in overtime on WR Michael Pittman Jr.’s 4-yard TD catch from QB Gardner Minshew II two plays after Alec Pierce’s 55-yard reception. 31a. Prior to that? Titans K Nick Folk missed his first PAT of the season in a game that ended 25-25 in regulation. Tennessee QB2 Ryan Tannehill held on the misfire after regular holder Ryan Stonehouse was injured while punting. 31b. Folk had to punt twice in Stonehouse’s stead, averaging a respectable 40.5 yards. 31c. The Colts turned two blocked Stonehouse punts into 9 points, including Grant Stuard’s 18-yard TD return. It would have been 10 points … yet Minshew threw a rare “pick-two” to Amani Hooker on a failed two-point attempt following Stuard’s score. 32. Wanted to end this week with a tip of the cap to the NFL – and most definitely to its players – for the ever-growing expansion of the “My Cause My Cleats” program, which allows for unique footwear that spotlights and raises money for so many worthy causes. Wouldn’t mind seeing the league relax its stringent uniform rules beyond this weekend given the good that can come of it. *** Follow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter @ByNateDavis.",8262,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/nate-davis/2023/12/04/nfl-takeaways-eagles-niners-chiefs-packers-week-13/71794528007/,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/images/smg/2023/12/03/USAT/71795145007-1789930280.jpeg?crop=4455,2507,x0,y231",Sports,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,stuard prior washington reich takeaway jk explosive mind enter hooker bring essentially visit elbow unusual conner return purdy threw note put pittman wr atlanta nick attempt back michael ryan miss bracket evaporate davis scenario folk early draft expect lone streak sway defense punt grant drive hill dominant hold mike reception thursday surrender convert cap close give evolve difference lash atop boyz ingram stead pitt week rating green land pace express james moore amid shutout seahawks nfl spotlight learn player today rb remain inside happen mark wait controversial tyreek formerly god bother financial carr stuck talk work schedule football coaster committee fail exercise cheetah star splash francisco indianapolis rush pat odd amani college resurgent nation packer career brock acknowledge field seattle ensure full reign stringent orleans row standing panther cleveland england brown lion ceedee pro perfect security turn hey bowl win overcame fide home blow qb receive miami race suggest philly rodgers worthy year detroit aaron major prescott spot knock represent lincoln importance elite super flacco multiple block respectable cardinal champ pass misfire bolt existence currently bona rare christian cancer tank dak matter disappoint mvp afc swift denver grab niner play bynatedavis position league speak rainy dom game congratulation hottest victory define desire rank include snap east joe afternoon finish faulk mccaffrey douglas uniform subjectively franchise falcon suffer hurt tannehill course south number disandro remainder marshall roller gm coulda x tds ram universe bypass fin held money bucs wild dallas rookie qualifies dolphin make expansion footwear improve rule frank overtime cfp dozen kind shoulder pretty cleat officer announcement alec weekend stonehouse houston left consecutive lamb charger rack dismember point yak throw beaten kamara injury gardner picked buccaneer colt scott run line pierce affair regular day holder record successive start scrimmage season minshew injured pigskin compelling yard time unique join combine miserably condition definitely jet defend qualify production gillette fun jalen championship issue rope break samuel average usa bowler advantage city lenny construct commander ouster patriot place highly cowboy club carolina derek angeles determine history chief tip titan pair uh zero raise bay regulation san eagle receiver credit team philadelphia catch saint score america texan sport deal tennessee hall tampa sunday party bronco night contender fall huge p rough playoff postseason coach invite decision hung nfc played deebo rematch lose arizona hope pittsburgh achilles steelers kick famers evans follow previous twitter loss weapon relax alvin beat stadium ground title scintillate concussion program taylor kansa regard td,0.9908,0.2178649237472766,6.127382075471694,0.4366128424951954,1,2023-12-04
ABC,1914 Baltimore News Babe Ruth rookie card nets $7.2 million,2023-12-04 01:29:00,DAN HAJDUCKY,"It's the most expensive Ruth item of all time.In 1914, a 16-year-old Baltimore paperboy named Archibald Davis collected baseball cards of his favorite Orioles -- then an International (minor) League side -- distributed in daily papers. He was fond of one depicting a 19-year-old pitcher born on Emory St. named Ruth. This is that card.Davis' cards, 15 in total, would be passed down in the family for generations -- often played with by children before they knew what they had -- for 107 years. The family loaned the cards to the Babe Ruth Birthplace & Museum in Baltimore in 1998. They were on display until 2021, when they were sold privately.""Overall, the card was pretty well preserved; the fact that it was in the hands of the museum for the last twenty-plus years helped keep it in the condition that it's in,"" said Brian Dwyer, president of Robert Edward Auctions, who brokered the sale. ""It's one of only ten that we know to exist.""For reference, there are more than 1,500 1952 Topps Mickey MantleS and 32 T206 Sweet Caporal Honus Wagners receiving a grade with card grader PSA alone.Notably, the Topps Mantle and the T206 Wagner have lengthy mythologies of their own, with different copies rewriting the sports card record book in recent years. The Baltimore News Ruth -- other than its exceeding rarity, that there's only one known copy with the same grade and one known copy graded higher -- doesn't boast the same lore. But as recently as the late 2000s, it was considered the most valuable sports card.""Ruth himself has mythology behind him; people don't realize he was made a ward of St. Mary's Industrial School at 7, under the custody and control of the priests of St. Mary's Industrial School until Jack Dunn"" -- then the owner and manager of the Orioles -- ""saw Ruth playing and became his legal guardian,"" says Dwyer. ""With this card, you have Ruth having been a ward of the state for more than two-thirds of his life, not knowing much about the world and certainly not knowing what he was going to become. [That's] what this card symbolizes.""Per Dwyer, the Ruth rookie card's existence wasn't really known until the 1980s -- astounding for a name who, Dwyer noted, ""needs no introduction.""""When we sold the record-setting Wagner at $6.6 million [in 2021], and we had people coming up to us -- even at the [National Sports Collectors Convention] -- asking, 'Who is Honus Wagner and why should we care?'"" Dwyer said. ""Not a single person asks who Babe Ruth is, what his significance to the game is, to the hobby, or frankly, to American culture. He transcends everything. We think the Ruth is the most significant card and it has not had its moment in the sun yet, so to speak.""This is the first time in a decade that a Ruth rookie card has been up for sale.""The last time one of these transacted [in 2013] was $450,000,"" Dwyer said. ""It's easier to buy an NFL team in the last decade than it has been to buy one of these cards.""REA communications director P.J. Kinsella added ""it could be well over a decade, possibly more, before we see another one of these come up to auction.""Notably, that same season, Dunn would trade Ruth to the Boston Red Sox. Ruth would pitch the Providence Grays to the International League title that summer and, by 1915, he'd go 18-8 as an ace for the big-league Red Sox, one of five on Boston's staff to win 15-plus games.""It's miraculous that this card exists,"" Kinsella said. ""He was on the Orioles for a few months and, by the end of [1914], he was in Providence. That he's encapsulated in this set, not knowing what he would become ... it's rather remarkable that he's on this card. The time that in which they were able to get him was so minute.""",3699,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/1914-baltimore-news-babe-ruth-rookie-card-nets/story?id=105350178,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,birthplace display national babe knew control mickey privately exceed miraculous director note caporal oriole guardian transact consider ten american custody rookie make moment single staff boast davis sell remarkable depict broker collect pretty high rewrite distribute baseball paperboy book pitch side communication ward dwyer life set school million expensive person record nfl grade season president born sweet time news convention late world emory encapsulate asks introduction mary sox condition hand topps buy archibald possibly grader preserve copy exist frankly realize trade loan favorite state recently easy red different jack hobby priest robert notably win lengthy receive brian mantle family year minute rea edward ace manager card rarity item mythology sun recent team add international total transcends culture industrial pass sport significant existence lore astound baltimore played boston kinsella play decade fact symbolizes month league psa owner speak exists significance providence museum generation game dunn valuable summer pitcher wagner ruth title legal collector fond minor gray paper auction daily child reference honus,0.99055,0.0,5.769698492462307,0.4079987550575785,0,2023-12-04
Fox News,Chiefs fall to Packers in stunning fashion as game ends in controversy,2023-12-04 01:02:00,Scott Thompson,"The Green Bay Packers stunned the Kansas City Chiefs, 27-19, and quarterback Jordan Love threw three touchdowns to secure the victory Sunday night.The Packers, now 6-6, move into playoff position in the NFC. The Chiefs would have secured the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a victory, but at 8-4, they are now the No. 3 seed behind the Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens.Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had the chance to deliver another magical late-game drive down eight points with less than two minutes on the clock and no timeouts, but controversy ensued as he tried to charge downfield.There was a controversial call, and more importantly, a no-call that will have sports personalities talking all day on Monday about what could have been.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMKansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (#15) looks to pass during the second half against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field on Dec. 3 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. (Patrick McDermott/Getty Images)The first came when Mahomes was rushing for 10 yards and Packers safety Jonathan Owens came up and hit him as he was trying to run out of bounds to stop the clock. A referee across the field threw the flag for unnecessary roughness, but replay showed that Mahomes was still in bounds when Owens made contact with him.While it shouldn't have been a penalty, the Chiefs moved up 15 extra yards to their 40-yard line with 57 seconds left to play.FROM OUTKICK: CHRISTIAN GROUP APPRECIATES SUPPORT AS COMMANDERS PLAYER FACES SCRUTINY OVER CLEATSBut the bigger official blunder came on the very next play when Mahomes decided to take a deep shot to Marquez Valdes-Scantling, who was clearly contacted by a Packers defender before attempting a catch.NBC Sports rules analyst Terry McAulay came on the broadcast to say that it was definitely contact before the ball was catchable and a flag for defensive pass interference should've been thrown.The Chiefs would've had the ball at the two-yard line with more than enough time to score and attempt a two-point conversion to force overtime.Instead, Mahomes tried for the end zone on multiple occasions, including a Hail Mary at the end of the game – but all of them went incomplete.Mahomes finished the game 21-of-33 for 210 yards with one touchdown and one interception.Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (#87) runs the ball while evading a tackle during a game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field on Dec. 3 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. (Todd Rosenberg/Getty Images)The drives in this game were long ones, and to put it into perspective, each team had just three of them in the first half.The Packers cashed in on the first, which lasted almost eight full minutes to begin the game. It was a 13-play drive, where Love looked locked in as he sold a beautiful play-action to A.J. Dillon to get tight end Ben Sims wide open for his first career touchdown catch from one yard out.GEORGIA CONGRESSMAN TROLLS DEADSPIN WITH PHOTOSHOPPED FACEPAINT AHEAD OF SEC TITLE GAMEThe Chiefs matched the Packers’ opening drive, but only in time spent on the field. They went over seven minutes as well, but Mahomes, the least-sacked quarterback in the NFL, was taken down twice in the red zone. Harrison Butker was forced to kick a 34-yard field goal to get Kansas City on the board.Green Bay's second drive took half as much time as the first, but the result was still the same. Love was slinging it, using Dontayvion Wicks to get into Kansas City territory. A few plays later, Christian Watson was streaking across the end zone when Love whipped it to him for the touchdown.The Chiefs, once again, couldn’t find the end zone on its second drive, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. They were on the field for 8 minutes and 20 seconds of clock, but Mahomes was sacked yet again on third down in the red zone, forcing another Butker kick.Packers tight end Ben Sims (#89) scores his first career touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs at Lambeau Field on Dec. 3 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. (Todd Rosenberg/Getty Images)With the Chiefs down at halftime, Mahomes & Co. were looking to set the tone in the second half. A touchdown drive was the ideal result to start, and that’s exactly what happened when Isiah Pacheco popped into the end zone from one yard out.But Love, showcasing his confidence all night long, had the response drive the Packers and everyone at Lambeau Field needed to see. One of the best plays of the night was Love launching it up on fourth-and-1 to Romeo Doubs, who caught the ball in between three Chiefs defenders for a 33-yard gain to set up the Packers in the red zone.From there, Love would find Watson yet again, this time with the young receiver launching himself in the air to make a catch over a Chiefs defender for a 12-yard touchdown.Mahomes, though, wasn’t giving up easily. He went 11 plays on the next drive and threw his only touchdown of the game to his backup tight end Noah Gray from two yards out to make it a 21-19 deficit.That touchdown came as the fourth quarter began, making it clear this game was going to come down to the wire. Green Bay was able to kick a field goal to make it a 24-19 game, but with tons of time for Mahomes to work with, the Chiefs were in a good position to take their first lead of the game at the right moment.Though Kansas City saw the exact opposite take place on the ensuing drive.On the second play, Mahomes was looking for Skyy Moore on a wheel route down the right sideline. However, Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon ran the route better than Moore, securing a key interception that turned out to be a game changer.Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love (#10) throws the ball against the Kansas City Chiefs at Lambeau Field on Dec. 3 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

USA TODAY,Committee snubbing unbeaten Florida State makes a mockery of College Football Playoff,2023-12-03 22:38:06,Nancy Armour,"Good to know these last four months didn’t matter. That results on the field don’t matter. Those are the only conclusions that can be drawn from the College Football Playoff selection committee’s decision to pass over an unbeaten, ACC champion Florida State for one-loss Alabama on Sunday. The committee members looked into their crystal balls and decided there was no possible way a Florida State team without its starting quarterback could compete, so why bother even letting them try? Especially when there was college football royalty Alabama there for the taking and SEC commissioner Greg Sankey reminding anyone who would listen that it’s an unwritten rule one of the four playoff spots is reserved for the SEC. There’s a problem with that. Several, in fact. But none larger than the committee going against its own precedent and snubbing a Power Five conference champion that did everything right on the field — a perfect season that included three wins over top-20 teams, as well as wins over two SEC teams outside of Tallahassee, and one of the top defenses in the country — because of what its members “feel.” That isn’t the pinnacle of competition. That’s a beauty pageant. “It renders the season up to yesterday irrelevant,” Florida State athletic director Michael Alford said in a statement, not even trying to contain his rage. “Wins matter. Losses matter. Those that compete in the arena know this. Those on the committee who also competed in the sport and should have known this have forgotten it,” Alford said. “Today, they changed the way success is assessed in college football, from a tangible metric - winning on the field - to an intangible, subjective one. Evidently, predicting the future matters more."" Alford isn’t wrong. About any of it. There is no question the committee had a difficult decision this year, its toughest in the 10 years of the playoff, after Alabama’s win over top-ranked and two-time defending champion Georgia in the SEC championship. Michigan and Washington were locks, but there were now four teams — Alabama, Florida State, Georgia and Texas — with legitimate cases for the final two spots. Somebody was going to be disappointed. Furious, even. But it shouldn’t have been Florida State. OPINION: CFP committee makes safe call in choosing Alabama over FSU. And it's the right call. The committee looked at Alabama with stars in its eyes, thinking of all those other times Nick Saban has won the national title and envisioning a similar scenario next month. (That he can dispatch with the troublesome Jim Harbaugh along the way is an added bonus!) Yes, Alabama has gotten better as the season has gone along. But let us not forget it was only a week ago the Crimson Tide needed a brain lapse by Auburn coach Hugh Freeze to win the Iron Bowl. Or that, for as dominant as Georgia has been, the one weakness Kirby Smart and the Bulldogs have had is Alabama. How much extra credit do Saban and Alabama deserve for running their record against Smart and Georgia to 5-1? “In the eyes of the committee, Florida State is a different team without Jordan Travis,” committee chair Boo Corrigan said, referring to the Seminoles' starting quarterback, whose season ended when he broke his leg Nov. 18 against North Alabama. “One of the things we do consider is player availability.” Except Travis was already out last week, when the committee moved Florida State back into the top four. The committee is also confident Alabama won’t have any injuries, cases of food poisoning or any other woes in the next month. Perhaps they can tell us who will win next year’s election. Or what the winning lottery numbers for the next billion-dollar jackpot will be. There is no perfect system that involves humans, who have their own biases and can be swayed by politicking. But this decision wasn’t just imperfect. It stinks and, let’s just go ahead and say it, it’s downright shady, dripping with SEC favoritism. Florida State might not be able to help its conference opponents, but it did beat every single one of them. Scheduled and won non-conference games against LSU and Florida, too. Beat the Tigers by a wider margin than Alabama did, I might add. And while the committee sees a lesser Florida State team without Travis, that lesser team beat Florida in Gainesville and, despite being down to its third-string quarterback against Louisville, ground out a win for the ACC title. More: College football bowl game schedule for the 2023-24 season: A full guide for fans. Again, when the playoff field is a subjective decision made by a collection of individuals, it’s always going to be open to criticism. That will still be the case next year, when the playoff expands from four teams to 12. But the purest, most conclusive metric is results. Wins and losses. On that alone, Florida State had the better season. If the committee is going to disregard that, then what’s the point of a playoff at all? What's the point of even having a season? Just pick the team, or conference, you want and anoint them as the national champion. Florida State deserves better than what the selection committee did. All of college football does.

Washington Post,"Jim Leyland, World Series-winning manager, is elected to Hall of Fame",2023-12-03 20:49:00,Chelsea Janes,"NASHVILLE — Longtime manager Jim Leyland was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday in a nostalgic start to MLB’s winter meetings.Leyland is a legend of his craft, a firebrand with a propensity for tirades and one of the winningest managers of the past 50 years not already in the Hall of Fame. Lou Piniella, who fell short by one vote again this year, is the 17th-winningest manager in MLB history with 1,835 wins for five teams and one World Series title. Leyland ranks 18th with 1,769 wins for four teams and a World Series title of his own. Of the 16 managers with more wins than Piniella and Leyland, 12 are in the Hall of Fame — and three (Dusty Baker, Bruce Bochy and Terry Francona) are not yet eligible.Leyland was elected by a 16-member panel of industry staples known as the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee for Managers, Executives and Umpires, which meets every three years. Each panelist was allowed to vote for three candidates who made most of their contributions to baseball after 1980. Beyond Piniella, former Washington Nationals manager Davey Johnson, 1983 Baltimore Orioles architect Hank Peters, ex-manager Cito Gaston, former executive Bill White and ex-umpires Ed Montague and Joe West were also under consideration.The Hall of Fame formed these committees to give consideration to players no longer eligible for election on the baseball writers’ ballots and to managers, executives and umpires whose résumés warrant Cooperstown consideration. This year’s committee included Hall of Famers Jeff Bagwell, Tom Glavine, Chipper Jones, Ted Simmons, Jim Thome, Joe Torre and Bud Selig; former and current executives Sandy Alderson, Bill DeWitt, Michael Hill, Ken Kendrick, Andy MacPhail and Phyllis Merhige; and media members Sean Forman, Jack O’Connell and Jesus Ortiz.Leyland received 15 of 16 votes. The 78-year-old’s major league managerial career began with Pittsburgh in 1986 after he spent four seasons as the third base coach for another Hall of Fame manager, Tony La Russa, with the Chicago White Sox. He managed the Pirates for 11 seasons that included the early years of Barry Bonds’s career and ended with a last-place finish in 1996.He left for the still-nascent Florida Marlins in 1997 and led them to a World Series title in his first season. He spent two seasons in Miami and one with Colorado before finding another long-term home with the team that signed him as a player, the Detroit Tigers. He managed Detroit from 2006 to 2013 and made two World Series appearances, losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006 and the San Francisco Giants in 2012.Piniella missed election by one vote for the second straight time. He spent 18 seasons as a player before transferring to the dugout. Those 18 seasons, which spanned four teams and included 11 years with the New York Yankees, were impressive, if not Cooperstown-worthy. He finished with a .291 batting average and more than 1,700 hits. He was the 1969 American League rookie of the year with Kansas City and made one all-star appearance, in 1972 with the Royals.His managerial career started the same year as Leyland’s, 1986, when he led the Yankees under George Steinbrenner. He managed them for two years, moved to general manager, then slid back into the dugout after one of Billy Martin’s firings in 1988. After three years in Cincinnati that included a World Series title in 1990, Piniella landed in Seattle, where he led stars Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez and Alex Rodriguez through one of the most memorable eras in Mariners history. Later, he led the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for three years and the Chicago Cubs for nearly four; he retired in 2010.",3652,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/jim-leyland-hall-of-fame-manager/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,colorado washington national panelist base medium russa davey impressive bochy tiger past cub ballot johnson oriole spent bruce manage writer transfer american current billy hit propensity rookie back make michael firing francona legend lead miss meet simmons jones early andy ken member pirate connell hill elect baseball mariner left industry give forman firebrand fell dewitt tom hank series tony land bond giant memorable yankee york piniella start player florida season begin straight managerial gaston louis batting time kendrick general bill chipper world ray nashville winning thome sox résumés vote committee star torre francisco bagwell slid martinez contemporary span executive umpire cito career average seattle selig city jeff bud marlin barry fame architect glavine jack history win eligible dugout tirade phyllis home alderson receive miami alex montague macphail bay year panel detroit san appearance major manager cincinnati move warrant terry form team lou nostalgic ted cardinal chicago mlb martin hall longtime tampa sunday consideration staple coach craft baltimore white winter devil short longer edgar lose league cooperstown sandy pittsburgh find merhige sign jesus rodriguez famers leyland baker west contribution dusty rank include candidate retire joe title former election steinbrenner finish griffey george kansa,0.7988,0.0,9.50618075801749,0.3257386363636363,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,"Tiger Woods completes PGA event, plans once-a-month 2024 tourney schedule",2023-12-03 20:30:00,Des Bieler,"After returning to competition just in time to play in — and complete — a PGA Tour event in the final month of the year, Tiger Woods said he felt ready for the “rhythm” of more regular appearances in 2024.The 15-time major champion, who turns 48 later in December, was speaking after playing all four rounds of the Hero World Challenge on a surgically repaired ankle. Woods said his return to the PGA Tour, after an injury-induced withdrawal midway through April’s Masters, left him encouraged about a plan to play once a month next year.“I think that having a couple of weeks off to recover, a week to build up — there’s no reason why I can’t get into that rhythm,” Woods said at a news conference Sunday following his round of 72, which left him even for the tournament and in an 18th-place finish at the 20-man, no-cut event in the Bahamas. “It’s just a matter of getting into better shape, basically. I feel like my game’s not that far off, but I need to get into better shape.”As Woods noted, he began the tournament “a little rusty” and shot a 75 in the first round. He followed that with rounds of 70, 71 and 72, good for a 3-under-par stretch over the final three days. Perhaps most importantly, Woods proved to himself and others that he could handle the rigors of a full 72 holes of tournament-level play, even if his performance left plenty of room for improvement. Scottie Scheffler finished 20 shots ahead in winning the event.“I haven’t done this in a while, so it feels nice to get out there with the guys and have some fun and compete,” Woods told Golf Channel. “I just wish I would have played a little cleaner, but there’s always next time.”“It was very special this year, having him back out on the course,” Scheffler said of Woods, who hadn’t played in the Hero World Challenge since 2019. “Seeing him complete four rounds was so cool. … Seeing the red-and-black [outfit] walking down the fairways — as players, we’re excited to see him back. Hopefully, we’ll get to see more of him. We’re appreciative of all he’s done for the game.”Woods hasn’t played so much as 12 events in a PGA Tour season since 2018-19. The pandemic disrupted most of the 2019-20 season and then, in February of the following year, he was severely injured in a single-car crash. The lower-leg damage Woods suffered continued to cause him problems, and after withdrawing from this year’s Masters, he underwent a fusion procedure in his right ankle.“I haven’t done it with my ankle, the way it is now,” Woods said at Sunday’s news conference, “and I was excited, each and every day, to kind of get through it and start piecing rounds together again. … I’ve got some work to do, and I’m excited to get back to work.”Woods said he was pleased with his driving at Albany Golf Course in Nassau but pointed to his short game as an area where he needed to “tighten up a bit.” According to Data Golf, Woods was fourth among the 20 players in shots gained off the tee, 15th in shots gained around the green and 19th in putting.Woods is set to make his next competitive appearance later this month in a non-PGA event, the PNC Championship, in which he will team up with his son, Charlie.

(Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images)Deebo Samuel, the veteran speedster for the 49ers, was a key reason why his team was able to dominate one of the best defenses in the league in Philadelphia.Samuel scored three of the six touchdowns San Fran put up on the scoreboard Sunday, and it was his pure speed and elusive abilities that made it happen.They all came in the second half, too.FROM OUTKICK: EAGLES HEAD OF SECURITY GETS STANDING OVATION FOR DRAWING EJECTION OF 49ERS DEFENDER DRE GREENLAWThe 49ers had a shaky start to this game as the Eagles forced back-to-back three-and-outs, though San Fran's defense held them to just two field goals for a 6-0 lead.That's when quarterback Brock Purdy got to work, going 85 yards on 11 plays to find Brandon Aiyuk for the 49ers' first touchdown of the game. Just like that, despite the slow start, they had the lead.After some more stout defense, the 49ers went even further on their next drive, hauling 90 yards downfield with Christian McCaffrey adding yet another rushing touchdown to his resume from two yards out, making it a 14-6 game.Jauan Jennings #15 of the San Francisco 49ers celebrates after a touchdown with Deebo Samuel #19 during the fourth quarter against the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field on December 3, 2023, in Philadelphia. (Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)That was the score going into halftime, and with the 49ers getting the ball first when play resumed, they wasted no time.This is where Samuel showcased his speed first, grabbing a tricky reverse run play from Purdy and taking it 12 yards to the right pylon for the 21-6 lead.Jalen Hurts and the Eagles would finally respond with their first TD score of the game, and you probably guessed it, as the ""Brotherly Shove"" of Hurts into the end zone from one yard out made it 21-13.49ERS' CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY APPEARS TO PRAY BEFORE RECORD-BREAKING GAMEBut five plays later, Samuel came calling again.This time, Purdy found him in the middle of the field, and Samuel saw daylight. Normally, no one would've seen the small seam up the field as daylight, but Samuel used it to go 48 yards for his second touchdown.After Jauan Jennings found the end zone himself on the next drive after an Eagles punt, the game was basically out of reach. Hurts, who had to go into the locker room as he was in concussion protocol for a few minutes, would find DeVonta Smith in the end zone to make it 35-19.Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles passes the ball during the fourth quarter against the San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field on December 3, 2023, in Philadelphia.

McCaffrey had 93 yards on 17 carries as well as 40 yards on three catches.Purdy was very efficient, going 19 of 27 for 314 yards with four touchdown passes and no interceptions.Meanwhile, for the Eagles, Hurts was 26 of 45 for 298 yards with one touchdown. The Eagles also struggled mightily on the ground, rushing for a team total of 46 yards, with Hurts' 20 yards leading the team.Deebo Samuel of the San Francisco 49ers celebrates after a touchdown during the third quarter against the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field on December 3, 2023, in Philadelphia.

Washington Post,Commanders’ blowout loss to Dolphins shows it’s ‘too late for growth’,2023-12-03 19:44:00,Nicki Jhabvala,"It’s over. Done.The Washington Commanders fired their defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach and had a plan to simplify parts of their defense so young players could play faster. They hoped things would be better. Different. At least not the same outcome as when they gave up 400-plus yards and 45 points to the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving.Sunday ended any illusion that these Commanders are anything but a team trudging to the finish line of a lost season. In front of a sellout crowd at FedEx Field, Washington fell into an early 17-point hole against the Miami Dolphins and never recovered, giving up 406 yards in a 45-15 loss. The defeat was Washington’s fourth in as many weeks and its sixth in the past seven games. It ensured the team would enter its bye week in a tailspin and with few options to reverse course.The Commanders (4-9) aren’t officially out of contention for a wild-card spot, but they’ve created little confidence they can turn things around over their last four games. Washington’s only guarantee now is ending yet another season without a winning record.Coach Ron Rivera, calling defensive plays for the first time since 2019, hoped some tweaks could at least stop the bleeding this week. The defense has relied on younger players to step into bigger roles because of injuries, so he trimmed the playbook to eliminate some of the checks and zone-match principles in coverage that might trip them up. He also made adjustments up front to try to generate more pressure and shuffled the coaching staff to fill the void.Yet the Commanders made many of the same mistakes and paid for them just as greatly. Missed assignments, missed tackles and missed opportunities.“You can’t do that,” Rivera said. “You just can’t do that in this league, especially against really good teams.”Washington had allowed a league-high 98 explosive plays (16 or more yards passing, 12 or more yards rushing) to opponents before Sunday. The Dolphins needed only three plays to get No. 99 — and then racked up eight more explosive plays throughout the game.On Miami’s first third down of the day, speedy wide receiver Tyreek Hill beat rookie defensive back Quan Martin for a 78-yard touchdown catch, setting a clear tone for the remainder of the game. Hill lined up in the slot and shook Martin at the line of scrimmage, leaving him stumbling out of the blocks as he turned in coverage. Martin trailed from two yards back, alongside Kam Curl, his safety help over the top, as Hill sprinted into the end zone.“Those guys are great at what they do, and they also get paid,” Hill said. “But at some point it’s like, man. I don’t know, man. I just appreciate it. Thanks for not respecting me, I guess.”They failed to respect him again in the second quarter.On third and seven from Miami’s 40-yard line, Hill got a running start with a motion to the outside, then turned on the burners to blow by cornerback Kendall Fuller and catch a 60-yard touchdown pass.Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa received pressure from a double blitz on the left side of the line, so he launched a deep ball downfield in Hill’s direction. Hill corrected his route and followed the ball, guiding it to the end zone. Not a single burgundy jersey stood in his way.If Hill were Miami’s lone offensive threat, maybe Washington could have been competitive.But the Dolphins are loaded, and they have a coach in Mike McDaniel who knows how to get his best players the ball — and often. Alongside Hill — who had 157 receiving yards, 30 more than Washington’s entire receiving corps — is wideout Jaylen Waddle, who is on pace to top 1,000 yards. Then there are Raheem Mostert, one of the NFL’s leading rushers, and dynamic rookie back De’Von Achane, who combined for 154 scrimmage yards and three rushing touchdowns in Miami’s win.“I think it is tough for their safety in that instance when you have guys like Tyreek, guys like Jaylen, who have one-on-ones, and then you put a ’backer out there with De’Von,” said Tagovailoa, who completed 18 of 24 passes for 280 yards, two touchdowns and a 141.0 passer rating. “I mean, I don’t know what you would expect them to do. If you expect them to cover Tyreek’s side, then we’re going to throw to De’Von. I mean, we liked our matchups, but it definitely is tough when you go man across the board and it’s press against really fast guys like that.”And if Miami’s offense were the lone problem, maybe Washington could’ve eked out a win.But the Dolphins’ defense stifled the Commanders’ passing game, sacking Howell three times and limiting him to 12-for-23 passing for 127 yards. In the final minute of the first quarter, after Miami had jumped to a quick 10-0 lead, linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel intercepted Howell and ran it back 33 yards for another touchdown.Howell, who has thrown a pick-six in three consecutive games, still flashed his potential and resilience, albeit inconsistently. On Washington’s ensuing drive after his interception, he found Curtis Samuel for a 33-yard completion, then punched it in the end zone with a one-yard run after two tries by the offense failed. In the third quarter, Howell had his finest play of the day when he scrambled on fourth and three for a 13-yard touchdown.But the troubles overshadowed the few bright spots. Among the bigger concerns was how little attention the offense paid to wide receiver Terry McLaurin. For only the second time in his career, McLaurin was catchless. He was targeted only three times.“Nah, I ran a lot of cardio,” he said when asked if he was frustrated by his minimal involvement. “It happens. It comes with it when it’s tough. Yeah, it’s frustrating, but I’m going to keep coming in and practicing and playing hard.”In the locker room after the game, the tension was palpable as veterans expressed frustration over not just Sunday’s loss but also the team’s failed attempts to improve year after year.“Yeah, I’ve been dealing with this for seven years,” defensive tackle Jonathan Allen said. “I’m tired of trying to build character. My character has been built up enough. I’m trying to win.”Added Samuel: “It sucks to lose and to lose like that. We got so much talent, and we know that. But if we’re not going out there and showing everybody, we’re just talking about it.”Throughout the season, Rivera has preached growth and development, noting the progress of Howell and his potential to become a viable long-term option at quarterback. Rivera has cited the change in system with Eric Bieniemy as offensive coordinator and the increased playing time of his youngest players on defense. But after four consecutive losses, including a pair of blowouts, the notion of any such growth has lost some credibility, a reality even Rivera acknowledged.“You can’t do the things we did and expect to win,” he said.With an upcoming bye, Washington’s hope now is that with rest and a renewed focus, it can try to give the talk of growth some legitimacy in the final four games. But what little is left of the season feels practically lost.",7011,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/commanders-dolphins-loss/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,wideout blitz rivera washington resilience concern load talent guy explosive frustration enter offense faster bieniemy viable big room burgundy target completion past renew remainder feel change note ran notion interception tailspin put credibility potential especially raheem upcoming top character attempt cornerback board locker call back dallas corp rookie front dolphin make veteran slot growth fuller focus howell simplify attention lead miss single deep staff jonathan improve early motion pressure punch stifle curl expect lone defense quarterback blowout fedex alongside drive leave hill fire linebacker mike left consecutive bright inconsistently outcome side give achane role wide rely clear paid fell rack playbook scramble plan point throw week rating young pace quarter express intercept set entire injury cardio bleeding run built system day defensive safety nfl scrimmage player start passer fourth season flash route eked tyreek contention ball matchup yard problem time step combine reverse zone talk lot catchless increase definitely part guide rest touchdown fail found mistake jumped defeat stumble jaylen cover sprint mclaurin rush passing stop samuel fine career frustrate field minimal shuffle thrown coverage ensure sack stood preach commander ron line mcdaniel illusion complete different fast bye tire andrew cowboy progress crowd turn downfield win tagovailoa recover development generate burner blow waddle involvement receive opponent miami offensive confidence pair double ensue jersey year minute option spot tone final receiver terry tough team add block shook backer catch dynamic mostert trip build martin pass trim correct deal press rusher sunday appreciate legitimacy principle eric coach suck sellout great officially create hole practice play instance lose league curtis reality check show hope tension fill threat tweak trudge game direction greatly trail follow speedy practically assignment loss albeit hop launch eliminate quick respect palpable include beat trouble overshadow coordinator adjustment ginkel kendall finish guarantee tackle limit sixth,0.5684,0.1711596063329054,7.147067039106148,0.4315619374897725,0,2023-12-03

Stroud’s favorite target in recent weeks, is reportedly out for the remainder of the year after fracturing his fibula on a goal-line play, per ESPN.The injury occurred in the first quarter as the Texans were looking to bust in a run from Dameon Pierce for a touchdown.

Dell was blocking on the play, and it appeared his leg got caught in the dogpile near the goal line as players began falling to the turf.Dell had to be helped onto a medical cart, and his reaction – placing a towel over his face and both hands on his head – said it all.

NPR,Undefeated Florida State is left out of 4-team College Football Playoff,2023-12-03 19:26:00,Emma Bowman,"Michigan, Washington, Texas and Alabama were picked on Sunday. Notably, Florida State was excluded, becoming the first undefeated power conference champion to ever miss out on the field. After FSU lost star quarterback Jordan Travis to a serious leg injury last month, speculation that the playoff selection committee would snub the Seminoles proved accurate. CFP committee chair Boo Corrigan explained the decision on ESPN: ""Florida State is a different team than they were the first 11 weeks,"" he said. ""If you look at who they are as a team right now, without Jordan Travis, without the offensive dynamic that he brings to it, they are a different team. And the committee voted Alabama four and Florida State five."" Corrigan is also the athletic director at North Carolina State, Florida State's Atlantic Coast Conference rival, noted The Associated Press. Florida State coach Mike Norvell said in a statement that his team was cheated. ""I am disgusted and infuriated with the committee's decision today to have what was earned on the field taken away because a small group of people decided they knew better than the results of the games. What is the point of playing games?"" he said. Travis said he was ""devastated"" by the outcome. ""I wish my leg broke earlier in the season so y'all could see this team is much more than the quarterback,"" he tweeted. Team selection is based on polls and computerized rankings, in addition to strength of schedule, head‐to‐head competition and championships won. As part of its selection criteria, the committee also considers the ""unavailability of key players."" Alabama rose to No. 4 following its Southeastern Conference championship game win over No. 6 Georgia, bumping Florida State to No. 5 despite a 13-0 record and ACC title win over Louisville, according to CBS Sports. Michigan wasn't happy either, knowing it would have to play Alabama instead. People who posted videos of the team reactions on social media said groans were heard from the Wolverines when Crimson Tide was announced. Asked whether his team deserved to make the cut, University of Alabama coach Nick Saban said, ""If you really want the four best teams in the playoff, then I think our team deserves to be one of those four teams."" On Jan. 1, University of Michigan will play University of Alabama at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. University of Washington will play University of Texas-Austin Longhorns in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. The winners of each game will play for the national championship in Houston on Jan. 8.

Washington Post,Maryland heads to Music City Bowl vs. Auburn; Virginia Tech to Military Bowl,2023-12-03 19:25:00,Gene Wang,"A little more than a week after wrapping up the regular season with a rousing victory to ensure a winning record, the Maryland football team celebrated again Sunday upon learning it would play in the Music City Bowl for the program’s third consecutive postseason appearance under Coach Michael Locksley.Seeking a bowl victory for a program-first third consecutive year, the Terrapins (7-5) will play Auburn (6-6) at 2 p.m. Dec. 30 at Nissan Stadium in Nashville. They previously won three straight bowls under Ralph Friedgen, but those triumphs came in 2002, 2003 and 2006.“Obviously it elevates our program,” Locksley said of a berth in a higher-tier bowl game. “We want to play games as close to Jan. 1 as you can [and get] those extra practices, but also it elevates the way in which our program is viewed. I think it’s great for us.”Virginia Tech (6-6) will face Tulane (11-2) in the Military Bowl at 2 p.m. Dec. 27 in Annapolis. The Hokies will be making their 29th bowl appearance in 32 years. They did not qualify for a bowl last season, their first under Coach Brent Pry. Virginia Tech’s previous appearance in a bowl came in 2021 — a 54-10 loss to the Terps in the Pinstripe Bowl.Three other schools from Virginia learned their bowl destinations Sunday. Liberty, No. 23 in the final College Football Playoff ranking, claimed the Group of Five’s berth to a New Year’s Six bowl: In the Fiesta Bowl at 1 p.m. Jan. 1 in Glendale, Ariz., they will meet No. 8 Oregon (11-2). James Madison (11-1), in its second year as a Football Bowl Subdivision program, accepted a bid to the Armed Forces Bowl to play Air Force (8-4) at 3:30 p.m. Dec. 23 in Fort Worth. And Old Dominion (6-6) will play Western Kentucky (7-5) in the Famous Toastery Bowl at 2:30 p.m. Dec. 18 in Charlotte.Maryland enters the Music City Bowl following a 42-24 win at Rutgers in which Taulia Tagovailoa threw for a season-high 361 yards to become the Big Ten’s career leader in passing yards (11,256). Tagovailoa also directed the decisive drive against Nebraska that led to Jack Howes’s field goal as time expired in a 13-10 road victory that secured bowl eligibility for the Terps, whose season began with five wins followed by four losses.But Maryland is guaranteed to finish above .500 for a third straight year for the first time since 2001 to 2003, the first three seasons under Friedgen. Last year, Maryland won the Duke’s Mayo Bowl, beating North Carolina State, 16-12, on Dec. 30 at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.“I knew that because of our team and the way this team has fought, having an explosive offense at times, defensively being one of the more improved defenses, that we would be attractive to a lot of different bowls with the type of players we have,” said Locksley, who added that he anticipates Tagovailoa, a redshirt senior, to play in the Music City Bowl, although it’s unclear which of his teammates may opt out. “If you look at the pecking order in which they are able to select, it speaks volumes to what the Music City Bowl thought about our program.”The Hokies were a draw for Military Bowl officials because of the fan base’s reputation for traveling well. They closed the regular season with a 55-17 win at Virginia to secure the Commonwealth Cup and bowl eligibility; Kyron Drones threw for 244 yards and three touchdowns.",3330,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/maryland-bowl-game-virginia-tech-liberty-jmu-old-dominion/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,nebraska base knew elevates passing explosive college fiesta offense career enters big eligibility celebrate pinstripe field state city ensure fort redshirt arm group decisive glendale claimed goal virginia drone threw different famous jack rouse peck taulia carolina view reputation rutgers mayo bowl win ten expire madison tagovailoa annapolis wrap kyron make michael nissan leader official lead western duke meet air dominion worth improve year liberty triumph defensively appearance locksley destination howe secure hokies final defense team accepted drive north add force maryland consecutive america terps bank senior unclear select close sunday music volume fought travel previously pry direct teammate oregon friedgen playoff postseason coach road week kentucky great extra james practice school regular play military record learn toastery player season begin speaks anticipates type game tech draw straight follow yard time subdivision previous victory loss auburn attractive nashville rank guaranteed beating tulane cup lot terrapin stadium opt football order ralph bid qualify berth commonwealth program brent finish touchdown,0.99,0.09009009009009,7.334256259204711,0.3418490929360493,0,2023-12-03

Washington Post,49ers’ Dre Greenlaw ejected for incident involving Eagles security staffer,2023-12-03 18:59:00,Mark Maske,"PHILADELPHIA — The San Francisco 49ers’ showdown with the Philadelphia Eagles here Sunday at Lincoln Financial Field became particularly heated when 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw was ejected for a second-half incident along the sideline following a play that involved an Eagles security staffer.Greenlaw took a left-handed swipe at Dom DiSandro, the chief security officer for the Eagles, after a rugged third-quarter tackle of wide receiver DeVonta Smith that drew a penalty.The officials also ordered DiSandro to leave the Eagles’ sideline. He received an ovation from the home crowd.The 49ers prevailed, 42-19, in a rematch of last season’s NFC championship game in Philadelphia, which the Eagles won in lopsided fashion after the 49ers were left with no healthy quarterbacks.The 49ers said they were particularly upset that Sunday’s incident involved a team staffer who is not a coach or player.“That’s why I tried my hardest not to lose my mind and embarrass myself too bad,” 49ers Coach Kyle Shanahan said after the game. “I didn’t get to see it all from where I’m at. But when I started hearing people explain it to me and stuff, I just can’t believe someone not involved in a football game can taunt our players like that and put their hands in our guy’s face. From what I was told, Dre did it back to him. And I was told that he kind of mashed him in the face a little bit. So he got ejected.“But it was a very frustrating play. I’ve got to watch it to have a true opinion on it. But I loved how we rallied after it.”The episode occurred with the 49ers leading 21-6. Greenlaw slammed Smith to the ground along the Eagles’ sideline following a catch by Smith, drawing a penalty for unnecessary roughness.The Eagles objected to the hit by Greenlaw, leading to a confrontation along the sideline. Greenlaw reached out with his left hand and appeared to make light contact with DiSandro’s face before order was restored.“That should never be in question, like, one of their guys interacting with a player on the sidelines,” 49ers linebacker Fred Warner said. “So it is what it is.”DiSandro was standing near Eagles Coach Nick Sirianni.“I definitely don’t like when other people get involved,” 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa said. “I don’t know exactly what happened. Dre has been really the enforcer for this defense since we got here in ’19. And that’s what makes him who he is. So we’re not going to knock him for being that. But in that situation, he knows he can’t do that. And it was a perfect learning lesson at this moment. Down the road, I don’t think he’ll make that mistake again.”Neither Greenlaw nor DiSandro, who has been with the Eagles since 1999 and also has the title of senior adviser to the general manager, was made available to comment following the game.Shanahan and Sirianni could be seen discussing the incident when they met on the field following the game.“Yeah, he was awesome,” Shanahan said during his postgame news conference. “He wasn’t a fan of what happened on the play, either. And he handled it with total class.”Walt Anderson, the NFL’s senior vice president of officiating, told a pool reporter that the officials “had a flag on the field for a personal foul by [Greenlaw], and then there was continuing action.”The members of the league’s officiating department in New York “saw video that showed that there was a staff person that made contact with the player and that the player involved [Greenlaw] made contact with the staff member, which warranted his disqualification,” Anderson said. “The non-player, he was contributing to that escalation. [The replay rule] does not afford us the ability to help the officials in throwing a flag that they do not throw for a non-player. That’s only afforded for a player action.”Anderson said the on-field officials succeeded in preventing the animosity from intensifying from there.“I can’t help but say that we felt like the officials, not only on this play but throughout the game, did a very good job of preventing the situation from escalating further,” Anderson said.The Eagles could face disciplinary action for DiSandro’s actions. The NFL warned teams in a memo in October that they “are responsible for the conduct of their players and other club personnel throughout the game day period” and could be “subject to a forfeiture of draft selections and/or significant fine” for violations.",4380,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/dre-greenlaw-ejected-eagles-security/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,anderson eject smith guy swipe mind action devonta hardest mash showdown disqualification adviser disandro walt stand slam comment subject explain put sideline ability nick ovation selection october back hit make kyle official lead moment staff video rule draft member contact forfeiture kind upset defense situation leave officer linebacker heat vice interact felt left senior escalation wide throw lopsided contribute staffer york day defensive person start nfl player learn bit season president happen handle fashion warn rally general financial violation news hearing lesson personnel football definitely hand mistake warner responsible incident francisco postgame question championship animosity conference confrontation fine frustrate dre field episode department pool bosa reporter embarrass intensify club prevent perfect greenlaw security believe chief home involve receive continue san prevail manager eagle knock reach warrant lincoln rugged light receiver object team philadelphia catch love total watch awesome healthy occur shanahan significant conduct disciplinary sunday available flag drew job personal foul particularly taunt coach road nfc opinion unnecessary play rematch afford lose league show enforcer dom game draw follow succeed fred stuff replay told escalate ground order penalty title sirianni officiate tackle memo period discuss,0.9538,0.0684931506849315,7.555079006772004,0.4458032245532246,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,"In Mike McDaniel, Josh Harris may have a blueprint for his coaching hire",2023-12-03 18:17:00,Barry Svrluga,"Let’s assume Josh Harris spent the second half of the Miami Dolphins’ 45-15 dissection of his Washington Commanders looking away from the “action” and instead weighing who might be his next coach. At this point, how could he not? Given the scene Sunday, it’s so easy to imagine a scenario in which Harris looked across the field at Dolphins Coach Mike McDaniel with no small degree of envy and said, “Get me one of those.”Sunday’s coaching matchup of McDaniel vs. Ron Rivera at FedEx Field was essentially unfair. One could teach the football version of differential calculus; the other struggles with basic addition. One masters three-dimensional chess; the other wrestles with tic-tac-toe.All you need to know about how Sunday played out is that Rivera fired his defensive coordinator Nov. 24 and took over play-calling himself, and it took McDaniel all of three plays to get wideout Tyreek Hill — he of the fastest-in-the-league legs — in one-on-one coverage with rookie defensive back Quan Martin and the safety shaded to the wrong side.Watch the clip of the ensuing 78-yard touchdown pass from Tua Tagovailoa to Hill, and it clearly and cleanly shows Hill beating Martin from the slot, a superior athlete excelling at his assignment against an overmatched opponent. But that play was less Hill over Martin than it was McDaniel over Rivera. The mismatch on the field was obvious. The mismatch on the sideline might be greater.“That’s just us in preparation on Thursdays,” Hill said, referring to the day the Dolphins work on third down. “Our coaches, they do a good job of reminding us of certain looks.”In everything the Dolphins did Sunday and are doing this season, you can feel the preparation. Tagovailoa saw the safety shading away from Hill. The quarterback locked eyes with his wide receiver: Adjust your route. Go for it.“That was something that we discussed during the week,” McDaniel said. “And it was really in the hands of the quarterback to — if he thought Tyreek would have a shot on the slot fade — to adjust his route. … It was something we had kind of planned to have that option.”This has got to be loads of fun for McDaniel, the Yale-educated, 40-year-old football savant who has at his disposal the talented Tagovailoa, the blazing Hill, third-year wideout Jaylen Waddle — Tagovailoa’s old teammate at Alabama — and a two-headed running back monster in Raheem Mostert and De’Von Achane. That combination is now 9-3 and averaging 32 points per game, just a smidgen behind Dallas for the top spot in the NFL.“This offense is fun,” Tagovailoa said. “I think any offense is fun when you’re scoring a lot of points.”Wonder what that’s like.Miami is a threat to put up video game numbers every time it steps on the field. That’s because of the excessive talent at the skill positions and Tagovailoa’s maturation as a quarterback, sure. But it’s also because of the guy with the joystick. He is fortunate enough to have uncommon speed at his disposal. He is smart enough to use it and to do so creatively.“I’ve always looked at football and offense as a very fluid, kind of schematic thing where you’re adjusting to what your players are good at,” McDaniel said. “The offense, it wasn’t really planned that way. I didn’t really have any hard plans about what it was going to be.“I have some philosophical beliefs in certain things. But it’s easy when you’ve been fortunate enough to be around a lot of different players and different scenarios: When you have speed like that, you try to do something with it.”That Harris, who took over ownership from Daniel Snyder over the summer, will be looking for a new head coach has morphed from assumption to certainty over the past several weeks. When Rivera fired Jack Del Rio and another defensive assistant after a 45-10 Thanksgiving Day drubbing in Dallas, it amounted to rearranging deck chairs on the S.S. Minnow.At this point, Harris doesn’t need more evidence that Rivera’s time here should come to an end, but Rivera keeps providing it. In his first game making the calls on defense, Rivera’s unit gave up 24 points in the first half. There’s no leg to left to stand on. The unit now gives up 30.4 points per game, worst in the league.So what matters is not only who’s next but what’s next. The reboot must, of course, include a new person to run the personnel department because it’s fair to look at the roster Rivera has built and wonder what current players will be part of a winning program in the future.But at head coach, there’s a choice to be made not just about leadership style and substance but about which side of the ball he coaches. That will help determine how the team is built and develops an identity. The preference here is not just for an offensive coach but for an offensive innovator. McDaniel qualifies, and it’s just a blast to watch a smart kid play with a fully loaded toy box.Go down the list of coaches in this league who will be doing their thing five and 10 years from now — who will be thinking and rethinking about ways to do their jobs — and it would have to include Kyle Shanahan in San Francisco, Nick Sirianni in Philadelphia, Sean McVay with the Los Angeles Rams (presumably, unless he bolts for TV), maybe Matt LaFleur in Green Bay and Kevin O’Connell in Minnesota and McDaniel. They all came up on the offensive side of the ball. Their ages: 43, 42, 37, 44, 38 and 40.This isn’t ageism. No one is kicking Andy Reid, 65, to the curb in Kansas City, and Pete Carroll, 72, probably will get to determine his endgame in Seattle. Houston’s DeMeco Ryans checks the young box (39), but he was a defensive coach by trade and has the Texans among the most surprising teams in the NFL. This shouldn’t be a cookie-cutter league, and Harris shouldn’t make a cookie-cutter hire.But he should make a progressive, forward-thinking choice that is in line with the way the league is going and gives a nod to what fans might find appealing. The ideal combination might be a young, inventive, offensive-minded head coach and a defensive coordinator who has seen it all. (Related: McDaniel’s defensive coordinator is 65-year-old Vic Fangio.)",6129,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/ron-rivera-mike-mcdaniel/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,wideout clip presumably fluid rivera washington load adjust talent remind guy preference offense action toy course essentially fully excessive number nod past uncommon stand feel maturation assume put sideline spent ram raheem top nick monster fair current call back rookie dallas qualifies dolphin make obvious kyle shade slot wrong video scenario master andy kid deck morph half fade vic kind wonder defense quarterback shot connell fedex minnesota leg hill fire joystick progressive version identity head mike houston thursday left tv box side give achane small wide mismatch philosophical basic kevin plan point week green leadership ageism young reid carroll ryans endgame run built day defensive superior probably safety person differential nfl player surprising season route assistant tyreek ball matchup eye time step provide imagine develops beating josh work lot personnel belief football unfair hand mcvay thanksgiving part savant skill blast touchdown alabama struggle jaylen francisco fun rearrange speed smart trade fangio chess average field seattle coverage city instead envy easy hard commander department ron mcdaniel line different away jack refer demeco schematic ideal disposal angeles determine athlete evidence win combination scene tagovailoa degree rio teach waddle opponent miami harris offensive overmatched ownership daniel ensue year bay san spot substance amount receiver team unit snyder philadelphia appeal watch mostert cleanly roster wrestle score martin shanahan texan bolt certainty related reboot assumption rethink sunday job teammate fortunate innovator drub style coach talented matt played calculus preparation matter inventive excel blazing play position dissection list league check show find threat kick game weigh age chair assignment curb smidgen choice summer include lock coordinator addition lafleur sirianni program kansa discuss,0.989,0.0978952520802741,6.953301587301585,0.4647402597402596,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,Maryland overcomes a lethargic start to surge by unbeaten George Mason,2023-12-03 18:12:00,Kareem Copeland,"Midway through the fourth quarter Sunday afternoon, Shyanne Sellers cut hard to the basket, caught a pass and crashed into a defender while flipping the ball up and in with her left hand. She hit the court, looked up at her celebrating Maryland teammates and gave a little shoulder shimmy.The junior guard took over in the second half after her team’s lackluster start, and her career day helped rally the Terrapins to an 86-77 victory over George Mason at Xfinity Center. Maryland needed the aggressive, scoring-minded version of Sellers on Sunday, and she responded with 28 points and 13 rebounds — both career highs — to go with five assists.“I’m starting to be able to decipher when to be aggressive and when to start kicking the ball out,” she said. “I feel like that’s beneficial for us ... and the shimmy felt good.”Four days earlier, Maryland (6-3) had one of its best offensive performances in years while cruising to a 114-44 victory over Niagara. It seemed an entirely different team trotted out of the locker room Sunday — because the first half was a disaster. George Mason (7-1) led 42-33 at halftime after Maryland was sloppy with the ball (12 turnovers), got outrebounded by a smaller team, showed questionable shot selection and failed to defend the three-point line adequately. Coach Brenda Frese was not happy at halftime.“I thought we came out flat. They had a lot more energy,” she said. “Seven turnovers in that first quarter were kind of hard to stomach, but not always is every game going to be pretty and flawless. I was really disappointed because we had been preparing that [the Patriots] were going to come in with a mentality that was going to be relentless, confident and being undefeated. We thought we had sent that message pretty clear.”Frese added: “I thought it was a terrific response after halftime … but we can’t wait 20 minutes from tip to be ready to play.”The energy was noticeably different in the third quarter, when Maryland crashed the boards hard and took multiple charges. Maryland ended the period on a 17-4 run for a 59-54 lead. Faith Masonius powered the surge with six consecutive points; she finished with a season-high 15 points and five rebounds in her new role coming off the bench.“I kind of had a slow start,” Masonius said. “I’m kind of trying to just have the mind-set [of] leave everything out there.”Sellers ended the third quarter with a buzzer-beating scoop shot. She didn’t have her most efficient outing (8-for-18 shooting), but she attacked the defense to draw 11 fouls and went 12 for 16 from the line. Brinae Alexander added 12 points after scoring a career-high 29 against Niagara.The Patriots trailed by just three with nine minutes remaining, but the Terps went on a 13-3 run to seal the win. George Mason went 2 for 8 from beyond the arc in the second half after shooting 6 for 13 in the opening 20 minutes.“Their size made it difficult for us to score in the paint, but that’s exactly what they did to counter us,” George Mason Coach Vanessa Blair-Lewis said. “... They were posting up a lot of our small guards. It just really made it difficult for us to get to the basket like we typically are able to do.”Sonia Smith led George Mason with 21 points, and Zahirah Walton posted career highs in points (18) and rebounds (14). Taylor Jameson added 16 points.Here’s what else to know about Maryland’s win:Sophomore Bri McDaniel went down midway through the third quarter with a lower-back injury; she hit the floor hard after driving to the basket. Two staffers helped McDaniel to her feet, but she struggled to stand straight as she was helped to the locker room. She returned to the bench but did not play.McDaniel, who had nine points in 17 minutes, has started the past two games with Lavender Briggs out with a lower-body injury.The Terps were without redshirt sophomore Emma Chardon, who is out for the season after she tore her left ACL on Wednesday. This is the second straight year she has been lost for the season; she tore her meniscus in the first game of 2022-23. Chardon had yet to earn major minutes, but losing a 6-foot-2 forward takes away an option for a Maryland team that is not very big.Freshman Emily Fisher has seen her time on the court rise recently, and her 29 minutes Sunday were a high. She brought a physical presence and grabbed eight rebounds, including five on the offensive end, to go with six points. ESPN ranked Fisher as the No. 80 recruit in the Class of 2023.“In the beginning, I definitely got tired and had to ask for a blow,” Fisher said. “I’m working on controlling when I’m going full speed and then also taking a break. But I think overall I just need to work on my conditioning and hopefully can keep getting these minutes.”",4740,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/maryland-george-mason-basketball-shyanne-sellers/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,control smith center frese espn earn emma happy walton questionable physical celebrate room past stand opening entirely feel return turnover crashed briggs grabbed foot locker board sophomore selection hit make lead power brinae junior brought half kind difficult defense shot shoulder pretty high shoot noticeably surge drive leave relentless floor cruise version rise earlier maryland felt left consecutive cut confident give small sloppy role point rebound counter terrific outrebounded quarter beneficial injury defender staffer run day disaster masonius alexander start presence fourth season remain begin wait caught seal ball straight rally time recruit flip midway faith scoop work lot aggressive terrapin attack definitely hand defend mentality shyanne niagara size fail struggle tore post brenda mason speed break trot career flawless meniscus recently full ready redshirt hard line mcdaniel patriot stomach different away lavender tire charge conditioning court win acl tip response blow basket message zahirah paint offensive chardon year minute slow option major multiple team energy add arc vanessa score terps sunday bri typically adequately teammate efficient foul fisher forward coach guard bench halftime class xfinity emily shimmy lose show wednesday disappointed respond decipher kick game draw trail sonia lackluster victory seller performance include undefeated prepare jameson afternoon ranked finish flat george taylor period,0.9407,0.0,7.110549222797925,0.4407832182832181,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,The four-team playoff’s final grift: A ridiculous stiff-arm for Florida State,2023-12-03 17:15:00,Jerry Brewer,"Illogical upon its inception, the four-team College Football Playoff fell victim to its structural nonsense Sunday. In its final act before expanding to 12 teams next season, it chose to make dubious history.The selection committee omitted unbeaten ACC champion Florida State from its field, marking the first time in the playoff’s 10 years that an unbeaten team from a Power Five conference was deemed undesirable for the prodigiously miniature tournament.“To me, this is a travesty to the sport,” ESPN analyst Booger McFarland declared on the air shortly after the announcement.Like the committee, McFarland was in the neighborhood of right. Others would call that wrong.To me, the whole sport is a travesty of access and competition. In this funhouse mirror, right or wrong is distorted. Fairness gets skewed in the pursuit of entitlement.It isn’t a true playoff if a team from a league the sport characterizes as elite goes undefeated and doesn’t make it. Florida State has a gripe for which it will never forgive those who control college football. But many teams over many eras — from the days of assumed national champions to the Bowl Championship Series to the playoff quartet compromise of the past decade — have felt a similar sting. It’s just that the Seminoles may have the most dramatic case, with the committee docking them because star quarterback Jordan Travis is injured.For their flawless 13-0 records, Michigan and Washington earned the top two seeds. A pair of 12-1 teams, Texas and Alabama, completed the field. It was insufficient for such a loaded season. Seven Power Five squads finished with no more than a single loss. Georgia (12-1), the two-time defending champion, couldn’t get in after losing for the first time in 30 contests during the SEC championship game against Alabama. Ohio State (11-1) was locked out after losing a one-score game at Michigan. Throw in Oregon (11-2) — which appeared as complete as any team in the nation but lost two three-point decisions to Washington — and it would have been a captivating eight-team postseason showcase.Instead, we’re left to debate another beauty pageant rather than an authentic tournament. And Florida State (13-0) was judged as pretty ugly.Blame the leadership that created this structure more than the selection committee. From the beginning, the College Football Playoff was susceptible to chaos and complication. Only a sport with toothless oversight would bargain its way to a system that showed more consideration for the traditional bowl game grift than a sensible playoff. With so many entities vying to protect their turf, this is the best the sport could come up with: four playoff teams, five power conferences, no room for extraordinary circumstances. Exclusion was the motivation, and in their favorite breathless defense, college football loyalists would proclaim this bite-size playoff acceptable because it preserved the value of a season-long journey in which every game mattered.Except now it doesn’t matter. The committee had to make the difficult decision to punish the Seminoles for misfortune, not defeat. The resilience Florida State has shown the past two games while winning without Travis — and, heck, winning the ACC title game over Louisville with third-string quarterback Brock Glenn, a freshman — couldn’t measure up to the assumption that the Seminoles aren’t as good as Alabama or Texas anymore.Sadly, if I were on the committee, I would be forced to make that same assumption. Florida State, which will face Georgia in the Orange Bowl instead, has a phenomenal defense, and with wide receiver Keon Coleman capable of a big play at any moment, this is still a quality team. But I think Texas and Alabama are better under the current circumstances. It’s absolutely stupid to have to make such a critical decision about a team with a perfect record based on the perception of fatal flaws that we have yet to see.“It’s unfathomable that Florida State, an undefeated Power Five conference champion, was left out of the College Football Playoff,” ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips said in a statement Sunday. “Their exclusion calls into question the selection process and whether the Committee’s own guidelines were followed, including the significant importance of being an undefeated Power Five conference champion. My heart breaks for the talented FSU student-athletes and coaches and their passionate and loyal fans. Florida State deserved better. College football deserved better.”Florida State Coach Mike Norvell took the next step in a statement of his own: “I am disgusted and infuriated with the committee’s decision today to have what was earned on the field taken away because a small group of people decided they knew better than the results of the games. What is the point of playing games? ... I don’t understand how we are supposed to think this is an acceptable way to evaluate a team. ... What happened today goes against everything that is true and right in college football.”Let’s not forget that, with rational leadership from the various conferences, the sport could have devised a better initial playoff. This one was created almost out of concession with the hope of expanding it later. The revision came one season too late, partly because the SEC poached super powers Texas and Oklahoma, starting another conference realignment wave before all parties could agree to playoff expansion. In 2021, it led the ACC, Big Ten and Pac-12 to nervously create “the Alliance” — an agreement to work together to save the future of the sport — but that just ended up making it easier for the Big Ten to ransack the Pac-12.Next season, 12 teams will make the playoff, but with 10 of the Pac-12 schools moving elsewhere, the Power Five is down to the Power Four. When the sport was desperate for equity, it doubled down on elitism. With a real tournament finally set to begin, a major conference representing the West Coast has been eliminated.If not for the temporary formation of the Alliance, expansion probably would have been agreed upon soon enough for a 12-team playoff to be held now. So, in a sense, the ACC also failed Florida State with its gullible commitment to a partnership.The players are left to clean up the mess on the field. Even when they do, they still suffer sometimes. Travis took to social media after the playoff announcement to say he was “devastated” and “heartbroken.”“I wish my leg broke earlier in the season so y’all could see this team is much more than the quarterback,” he wrote. “I thought results matter. 13-0 and this roster matches up across any team in those top 4 rankings. I am so sorry.”He shouldn’t apologize. Neither should the selection committee for doing its best with a bad format. This is on the mathematicians and peacekeepers who created a postseason format that guaranteed at least one Power Five conference would always be left out and made it nearly impossible for anyone but independent Notre Dame to enter the championship equation. Over the past 10 years, Cincinnati in 2021 is the only program not in the Power Five or named Notre Dame to qualify.Forty spots, one anomaly — that part of the plan worked out perfectly for the big boys.A boxed-out, big-name undefeated team? Definitely not something college football ever envisioned.To avoid that, the only choices would have been to leave out an SEC team for the first time or overlook Texas, which beat that SEC team earlier in the year. Somehow, Florida State’s exclusion managed to be the most controversial and palatable option.

Washington Post,Alaska Airlines reaches deal to buy Hawaiian Airlines for $1.9 billion,2023-12-03 15:50:00,Lori Aratani,"Alaska Airlines has reached a nearly $2 billion deal to buy Hawaiian Airlines, executives with the two carriers announced Sunday.Under the terms of the transaction, Alaska Air will pay $18 a share in cash, the two companies said, for a transaction value of $1.9 billion.“This brings together two great companies steeped in history — both 90 years in service,” Alaska Airlines chief executive Ben Minicucci said. “We share the same values — connecting communities and connecting people.”Peter Ingram, chief executive of Hawaiian Airlines, said his airline has expanded over the years, adding a hub in Maui and more international flights, but hasn’t been able to offer its customers access to more destinations on the mainland. The deal with Alaska will make that possible.“There is something really unique about this combination when you think about the origins of these two companies,” Ingram said. “There are no two states in the country that are more reliant on transportation than Alaska and Hawaii.”News of the agreement was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.The transaction would be the second airline merger in just over a year and is expected to face close scrutiny by regulators. It comes at a time when the Biden administration has been aggressively challenging such deals in a wide swath of industries that are dominated by a small number of players. A trial challenging a merger between JetBlue and Spirit Airlines is currently underway in Boston with closing arguments expected on Tuesday.Aviation analyst Henry Harteveldt said because of those dynamics, the timing of the announcement is likely to raise eyebrows.“Given the Biden administration’s stated objections to further consolidation in highly concentrated industries, is this really the right time for two airlines to merge?” he said. “In this case, however, I think the Biden administration would have a hard time objecting to the combination of Alaska and Hawaii. Both are very small airlines relative to the four largest carriers. There’s very little route overlap. And we’re not talking about the loss of an ultra-low-fare airline in the process.”Even so, others said the loss of any carrier will be a loss for consumers.“Competition between airlines is the single biggest cause of cheap flights. A merger between these two airlines — whose route maps have dozens of flights that overlap — would result not in more cheap flights for consumers, but fewer,” said Scott Keyes, founder and chief flight expert at travel website Going.com.It remains to be seen how regulators will view the deal. The Justice Department did not comment on the Alaska merger.In addition to challenging a proposed merger between JetBlue and Spirit Airlines, the Justice Department successfully filed suit to block an alliance between JetBlue and American Airlines that was approved in the waning days of the Trump administration.In the case underway in the same federal court in Boston, Justice Department lawyers are arguing that a merger between JetBlue and Spirit should not be approved because it will lead to the loss of an ultra-low-cost carrier with particular appeal to cost-conscious consumers, leading to fewer seats and higher prices that could leave some consumers without flight options. JetBlue, however, has argued that allowing it to acquire Spirit would help consumers, because as a larger airline it would be a stronger challenger to the top four carriers, forcing them to lower their prices.Alaska is currently the nation’s fifth largest carrier but would drop to sixth if the JetBlue-Spirit merger is approved. However, combining with Hawaiian would enable it to retain that fifth spot. The last major U.S. merger in 2017 also involved Alaska, which outbid JetBlue for Virgin America.If the deal is approved, the carriers will have one operating certificate, but will continue to operate as separate brands.“People in Hawaii are very passionate about the brands that have been around here for a long time,” said Ingram. “One of the things that is really going to resonate today is the show of respect that there is for the Hawaiian brand. The team has decided that it is important to maintain that brand going forward. I think that’s going to be important in this community.”Unions representing pilots, flight attendants, passenger service, ramp and other services at Alaska and Hawaiian said they would closely scrutinize the impact the merger would have on workers before deciding whether they would support it.In a statement, the nation’s largest flight attendants union, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 6,800 flight attendants at Alaska and 2,200 at Hawaiian, said it wanted to ensure the merger would improve conditions for flight attendants.The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), echoed similar sentiments.“Our membership at Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines are rightfully proud of the work they’ve done to make these carriers successful,” said Mike Klemm, the IAM District 141 president and directing general chair. “We will use every resource necessary to ensure that their livelihoods are protected during this acquisition.”Minicucci said there will be no loss of union jobs because the carriers are not making any changes to their networks. He said the airlines overlap on only 12 routes. Alaska also will open a “significant” regional headquarters in Hawaii, similar to the ones it operates in Alaska and California, he said.",5470,https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/12/03/alaska-airlines-hawaiian-airlines-merger/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,membership competition large maintain transaction wan big number resonate mainland change operate statement comment acquire origin henry top merge share similar consolidation minicucci american impact steep brings make enable aggressively regional spirit ramp lead dominate timing single air improve service concentrate closely dozen agreement expect association access california high founder leave overlap trump announcement outbid airline transportation force mike country pilot industry close announce give connect small brand company wide hub ingram remains long jetblue propose scott network day biden street underway player today drop president headquarters route retain machinist successfully administration general time unique proud combine news federal certificate attendant talk district work alliance condition community operates buy expand separate expert resource passenger merger suit virgin consumer cheap executive hawaii nation regulator relative analyst challenger aerospace state alaska echoed decide ensure maui argue hard department protect argument successful klemm highly scrutiny closing view history operating court cash combination result carrier chief swath strong involve pay challenge continue term raise year approve option offer value major spot reliant keyes lawyer reach destination represent object iam team union add hawaiian block international appeal case dynamic report significant deal map worker low travel currently job direct trial support forward livelihood customer price boston flight particular great scrutinize website rightfully show seat chair loss wall passionate respect important open objection addition justice harteveldt file billion sixth,0.99365,0.0,11.131271617497458,0.5384999999999998,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,‘Devastated’ Florida State QB apologizes after College Football Playoff snub,2023-12-03 15:25:00,Cindy Boren,"The pain of a promising season cut short last month by a gruesome injury was compounded for quarterback Jordan Travis, who said Sunday that he wished “my leg broke earlier in the season so y’all could see this team is much more than the quarterback” and even felt compelled to apologize after learning his undefeated, ACC champion Florida State team had been passed over for one of the four College Football Playoff berths.“Devastated. Heartbroken,” Travis wrote on social media moments after the College Football Playoff Committee announced its final foursome. “In so much disbelief [right now], I wish my leg broke earlier in the season so y’all could see this team is much more than the quarterback. I thought results matter. 13-0 and this roster matches up across any team in those top 4 rankings. I am so sorry. Go Noles!”Michigan was the top-ranked team and Washington was second while Texas and Alabama, both with one loss, leapfrogged the Seminoles, who fell to fifth. Michigan and Alabama, the No. 4 team, will meet in the Rose Bowl, with Washington facing No. 3 Texas in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1. Florida State will play No. 6 Georgia on Dec. 30 in the Orange Bowl.FSU Coach Mike Norvell did not mince words about his 13-0 team, which is the first unbeaten Power Five conference winner to miss out on the College Football Playoff in the 10 years of the four-team playoff’s existence.“I am disgusted and infuriated with the committee’s decision today to have what was earned on the field taken away because a small group of people decided they knew better than the results of the games,” Norvell said in a statement. “What is the point of playing games? Do you tell players it is okay to quit if someone goes down? Do you not play a senior on Senior Day for fear of injury? Where is the motivation to schedule challenging nonconference games? We are not only an undefeated [Power Five] conference champion, but we also played two P5 nonconference games away from home and won both of them. I don’t understand how we are supposed to think this is an acceptable way to evaluate a team.“I’m hurting for our players who have displayed a tremendous amount of resilience and response this season. What happened today goes against everything that is true and right in college football. A team that overcame tremendous adversity and found a way to win doing whatever it took on the field was cheated today. It’s a sad day for college football.“I’m proud of the work we have put in and the players I have the privilege to coach. We have one more opportunity to define this 2023 team in the Orange Bowl, and I believe in how our team will respond.”Florida State Athletic Director Michael Alford echoed that, saying the decision gave in “to a narrative” that is “destructive, far reaching, and permanent not just for Florida State, but college football as a whole.”“The argument of whether a team is the ‘most deserving or best’ is a false equivalence,” he continued. “It renders the season up to yesterday irrelevant and significantly damages the legitimacy of the College Football Playoff,” Alford said in a statement. “The 2023 Florida State Seminoles are the epitome of a total TEAM. To eliminate them from a chance to compete for a national championship is an unwarranted injustice that shows complete disregard and disrespect for their performance and accomplishments. It is unforgivable.”Jim Phillips, commissioner of the ACC, called the omission “unfathomable.”ESPN’s Booger McFarland said the decision to take Alabama over FSU was “a travesty.”“I understand that we want to look at style points,” McFarland said, “and who are we going to get for the best matchups. But that’s not what this is about. This is about understanding to get the four best teams. One team has a loss. And that’s Alabama. One team doesn’t, in Florida State. And the fact that this committee could take a Power Five conference champion that’s undefeated, those kids that went out there and busted their behind, and not get into the playoff based on the eye test. Mind you, this is the same Alabama team that needed a prayer in Jordan-Hare to beat an Auburn team that lost to New Mexico State. That’s really what has me bothered right now.”",4220,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/jordan-travis-florida-state-devastated/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,washington resilience national base knew unwarranted medium espn mind earn hurt social suppose statement director put motivation acceptable false top michigan call michael power fear moment miss infuriate meet foursome kid quarterback mcfarland leg omission disbelief rise earlier felt mike compel georgia mince continued cut senior accomplishment announce give deserve small nonconference fell match point sugar privilege injury fsu equivalence prayer day jordan learn florida today player season athletic happen champion evaluate matchup compete bother eye proud yesterday auburn test broke work schedule football pain understand committee found quit tremendous alabama gruesome word championship conference college damage unbeaten state field echoed decide render group argument complete destructive away alford disregard opportunity phillips acc bowl win result believe significantly overcame write injustice home response challenge norvell year narrative noles reach compound heartbroken final amount team wish total epitome cheat texas roster winner sorry pass commissioner irrelevant mexico sunday legitimacy sad disrespect promising devastate disgust orange playoff chance coach style decision adversity played matter permanent short apologize play booger fact lose month show leapfrog game define loss eliminate performance beat undefeated seminole ranking travis displayed bust,-0.0133499999999999,0.2843601895734597,6.879907192575406,0.5813448773448774,0,2023-12-03

Washington Post,"Michigan, Washington, Texas, Alabama selected for College Football Playoff",2023-12-03 12:26:00,Chuck Culpepper,"As the proud Florida State fan base began a life of pained rehash and sustained grievance over this indecipherable 2023 season, the four College Football Playoff spots went Sunday to No. 1 Michigan, No. 2 Washington, No. 3 Texas and No. 4 Alabama. This followed the selection committee’s impossible grapple with the harshest puzzle of the four-team playoff era, and it pitted Michigan against Alabama in the Rose Bowl national semifinal, with Washington against Texas in the Sugar Bowl national semifinal, both set for Jan. 1.It also omitted No. 5 Florida State (13-0), and that qualified as loud and landmark. The Seminoles became the first unbeaten Power Five conference team to miss the playoff, after 13 had gotten the nod previously, plus one from the Group of Five (Cincinnati in 2021). Those all happened in seasons clearer than this one with its crowded leader board and infinitesimal margins, and that reality paired with the gruesome leg injury of Nov. 18 to Florida State quarterback Jordan Travis, which limited the Seminoles’ capabilities going forward. With second-string quarterback Tate Rodemaker also injured Saturday night, third-string Brock Glenn completed 8 of 21 passes for 55 yards in his first college start, Florida State’s 16-6 wriggle through No. 14 Louisville in the ACC championship game.Factoring into the odd circumstances were the compelling 12-1 seasons of Texas and Alabama, which won the Big 12 and SEC championships, respectively. While Michigan (13-0) and Washington (13-0) awakened Sunday as sure bets, Texas and Alabama had to hope. The Longhorns had lost only to Oklahoma, which held down the No. 12 ranking last week, while the Crimson Tide had lost only to the Longhorns, a 34-24 thumping in Tuscaloosa on Sept. 9 that jeopardized Alabama’s playoff chances and left it marooned at No. 8 in all five previous rankings this season. As the season progressed with its thick stew of contenders, Alabama’s four wins over ranked teams wound up topmost among the teams in the closing arguments, its win over No. 1 Georgia on Saturday became the stoutest of any team, and its leap into the top four on the closing Sunday tied Texas for the largest in the 10 College Football Playoff seasons.Further shouting the commotion, Alabama vaulted from No. 8 to No. 4, and Texas from No. 7 to No. 3. Previously, nobody had reached the playoff from any further back than No. 6 (Georgia in 2017 and Oklahoma in 2019).Epitomizing those margins, Georgia’s fall from No. 1 to the suburbs of the playoff at No. 6 became the first time a No. 1 team in the next-to-last rankings had not wound up reaching the final four. Alabama’s presence at the back edge of the playoff list meant the imperial SEC has reached all 10 playoffs (with 12 berths total), while the ACC’s absence became its fourth, placing it behind only the Big 12 (five) and Pac-12 (seven) in that dour category.Michigan’s berth became its third in a row and third overall, while Washington will appear for the second time and the first since 2016-17. Texas will appear for the first time, while Alabama will appear for the eighth.Per annual habit since the inception of the four-team playoff concept in 2014, the committee meets weekly near the Dallas-Fort Worth airport during the last six weekends of the season.

CNN,Tiger Woods ‘pleasantly surprised’ with how his body is responding on his competitive return to golf,2023-12-03 07:24:00,Aimee Lewis,"Competing in his first tournament since undergoing ankle surgery, Tiger Woods said he is “pleasantly surprised” with how he has physically recovered after each round at this week’s Hero World Challenge.The 15-time major winner posted a third round one-under 71 on Saturday in Albany, the Bahamas, moving him to level-par overall and tied for 16th after an encouraging performance.Until this week Woods had not competed since withdrawing from the Masters in April with an injury which then required surgery, so interest in seeing how the American would perform over four rounds has been high.Speaking to the PGA Tour after his third round, Woods said: “It could’ve been a little bit better than the score indicates, I could’ve shot something in the high 60s today which would’ve been nice.“I still have game, it’s whether or not the body can do it or not.“I’m pleasantly surprised with how I’ve recovered every day. Like I said, the ankle is fine. I’m a bit sore in other parts, but that’s ok.”“I’m very excited how the week’s turned out,” he added, per the PGA Tour.Woods underwent ankle surgery after enduring “constant” pain across his three rounds at Augusta National during the Masters, which was only his second competitive appearance of 2023.The former world No.1 has had a long list of physical issues in recent years, including severe leg injuries suffered in a car crash two years ago.He told reporters last week that the best, and most realistic, scenario for 2024 would be to compete in one tournament per month.Woods recorded five birdies and four bogeys during his third round, finishing one-over-par on the final nine – an improvement on the previous two rounds when he had struggled on the back nine.Woods is 16 shots off compatriot and world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who leads going into the final day after posting a seven-under 65 on Saturday.

CNN,Why LeBron James’ incredible 360 layup went viral,2023-12-03 07:11:00,Issy Ronald,"For an NBA great like LeBron James, there are small moments on the court that define their greatness as much as any statistic, and when they happen, they tend to transcend the game in which they are moored, becoming emblematic of all their achievements.James enjoyed such a moment on Saturday in his LA Lakers’ 107-97 win over the Houston Rockets, as he pivoted past the defense and pulled off an incredible 360 reverse layup, before falling to the floor where he lost track of the ball.But “the fans let me know that I made it,” he later told reporters. “And then my teammates, by them running on the floor or whatever they did down there, allowed me to see it on the Jumbrotron because it stopped the play because of the technical.”As the team celebrated wildly along with the crowd, some even holding their heads in disbelief, Christian Wood received a tech for coming onto the floor from the bench in his excitement.Social media too exploded with disbelief and awe; one user called him an “artist,” others described it as “unreal” or “insane.” As of Sunday morning, the moment had received more than 1.2 million views on the NBA’s X, previously Twitter, account alone.But for all the disbelief, there was a sense of conforming to normality. After all, even at almost 39 and in his 21st NBA season, LeBron is still LeBron, his presence on the court still able to transform games and generate column inches.And like the true greats, he can transform his image on the court through moments like this, revealing himself to be LeBron the icon with all his glittering achievements as well as simply LeBron the player.“That’s right up there, it’s what you come to expect from him,” coach Darvin Ham told reporters afterwards. “But the most impressive thing is at what stage in his career he’s doing it in. He’s breaking barriers it seems every day.”James added 16 points and seven assists, while Anthony Davis poured in 27 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Lakers to the win.“It was a crazy shot,” Davis said. “At this point in his career he’s done everything that he literally just goes out and tries stuff and sees what works.”James later was embroiled in a tense encounter with Rockets head coach Ime Udoka, who was ejected afterwards.",2236,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/03/sport/lebron-james-incredible-360-layup-viral-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231203044717-01-lebron-james-layup-120223-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,eject transform literally medium crazy nba stop break career transcend impressive celebrate statistic morning glitter past conform tend embroil reporter x view crowd icon wood court win wildly unreal call make generate emblematic receive lead moment davis ime pivot expect defense shot team explode disbelief add floor anthony stage head hold houston moor saturday described encounter small image sunday artist previously jumbrotron reveal fall teammate darvin simply christian coach point rebound bench normality rocket pull great james run million lakers play lose presence column season happen assist game tech enjoy awe barrier twitter define incredible greatness reverse stuff tense account told achievement udoka layup track user lebron,0.94545,0.5366726296958855,7.53764192139738,0.4652713773681516,1,2023-12-03

I’m taking it day by day and I’m just trying to go about my business and see where it takes us.”This was supposed to be the season in which the Browns reaped the on-field benefits of trading for Deshaun Watson and signing him to a guaranteed five-year, $230 million contract. That didn’t happen; Watson’s second season with the franchise following the March 2022 trade with the Houston Texans was cut short by shoulder issues. Watson made only six starts, and just when he began to show promise, completing all 14 of his second-half passes in a comeback victory at Baltimore last month, his season ended because of a broken bone in his shoulder that required surgery.PJ Walker and rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson also have made starts for the Browns this season, but the team signed Flacco last month as an insurance policy. And with Thompson-Robinson in the NFL’s concussion protocol and ruled out, Coach Kevin Stefanski went with Flacco over Walker as the starter. Stefanski said last week he was confident that Flacco had picked up the Browns’ offensive system well enough to be ready to play.“Joe is a pro,” Stefanski said. “I’ve been around pros. He’s right up there. He does his job. … He can talk through it just because he’s been in so many different systems. He’s had so much experience in this league. So I think he leans on that experience, certainly, in a situation like this.”Flacco, 38, will be making his 181st NFL start in his 184th regular season game for his fourth team. He spent one season with the Denver Broncos and three seasons with the New York Jets after 11 seasons with the Ravens. He had been out of the league this season until being signed by the Browns; he made four starts last season for the Jets.“It’s definitely exciting, the idea of it,” Flacco said. “There’s a lot of things about being at this point in my life that make it really exciting, even besides just playing the game of football. There’s so many things that add to it now, having young kids and feeling their excitement about it. And when you are away, it puts things in perspective a little bit. ... You just try to let these opportunities take care of themselves and do your best to be ready for them.”The Browns spent the week based in Los Angeles after losing Sunday in Denver. They hold the No. 6 playoff seed in the AFC at 7-4 and lead the league in total defense, explaining how a team with four different starting quarterbacks can be well positioned for the postseason. They could become the first NFL team since the Texans in 2015 to get at least one win with each of four different starters at quarterback in a season, according to ESPN.The Browns, with their superb defense, don’t need a quarterback to do extraordinary things. They simply need a competent game manager who avoids major mistakes and keeps the offense somewhat functional. That’s not a championship formula. But it could be good enough for the Browns to reach the playoffs. Flacco is the sort of steady veteran who seems capable of filling such a modest role. He is said to have thrown the ball with plenty of zip during practices last week.“My arm feels good,” he said. “I think I did a decent job of keeping it in shape. I’m just trying to make the throws. … I’m worried about being on time, in rhythm and all those things more than I am about how strong the ball is getting there.”Jets’ predicament: Quarterback Aaron Rodgers resumed practicing last week with the Jets and left open the possibility of playing in their Dec. 24 game against the Washington Commanders, if not sooner, as he recovers from the torn Achilles’ tendon in his left leg suffered four offensive snaps into the season opener.But Rodgers, who turned 40 on Saturday, also acknowledged that the Jets will have to remain in playoff contention for it to make sense for him to consider playing again this season, even if he’s physically able to do so.That’s the issue. The Jets have lost four straight and have a record of 4-7 entering Sunday’s matchup with the Atlanta Falcons in East Rutherford, N.J. By some calculations, their playoff chances are less than 1 percent.The Jets face the Texans and the Miami Dolphins after this. Tim Boyle starts Sunday against the Falcons. He’s winless in his four career NFL starts. If the Jets lose again, any realistic notion of Rodgers returning this season perhaps should be abandoned, whether Rodgers actually does so or not.NFC South woes: The league’s most pitiable division is doing it again.All four NFC South teams are below .500 entering Sunday. The Falcons and New Orleans Saints, at 5-6, are in a virtual tie for first place, with the Falcons holding the tiebreaker edge based on a head-to-head victory last week. Those two meet again in the regular season finale in New Orleans.The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are one game behind with a record of 4-7, while the Carolina Panthers have a league-worst mark of 1-10.The Buccaneers won the NFC South last season at 8-9. No division in the NFL has ever had a winner with a losing record in consecutive seasons.Big game in Philly: The Philadelphia Eagles host the San Francisco 49ers in a late-afternoon game, a rematch of last season’s NFC championship game won in lopsided fashion by the Eagles after the 49ers were left with no healthy quarterbacks.In that game, Brock Purdy suffered an elbow injury that required offseason surgery. Now he returns to Lincoln Financial Field as an MVP contender. The 49ers, at 8-3, trail the Eagles, who are an NFL-best 10-1, by two games in the race for the NFC’s top playoff seed.There is some ill will surrounding the game. 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel called Eagles cornerback James Bradberry “trash” following the NFC championship game loss, and Samuel said last week that he had no regrets about that harsh characterization of Bradberry’s play.Tabor’s debut: Chris Tabor makes his debut as the Panthers’ interim coach when they face the Buccaneers in a late-afternoon game in Tampa.Tabor was promoted from special teams coordinator to interim head coach Monday when Panthers owner David Tepper fired Frank Reich after only 11 games.Tabor, who served as the acting head coach of the Chicago Bears for one game during the 2021 season after Matt Nagy tested positive for the coronavirus, is the third interim coach of Tepper’s ownership tenure with the Panthers, which began in 2018. The Panthers have also had three full-time head coaches under Tepper, from Ron Rivera to Matt Rhule to Reich.",7012,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/nfl-primer-browns-joe-flacco/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,guaranteed pass modest frank rutherford finale matt suppose contract store regret insurance york deebo place job simply super ball total afc bradberry division veteran concussion jet start formula realistic leg test sooner contender deshaun excite coronavirus matchup brock surgery rhule rule game sunday chris stefanski rodgers happen healthy policy postseason mistake extraordinary bear nfc fashion rivera baltimore falcon fourth arrives competent brown definitely steady rematch pro defense promise positive excitement kid sign chicago require washington miami tie walker playoff flacco left bit aaron san feel acknowledge thrown xlvii offensive protocol cleveland enter act fill tampa panther signing follow regular carolina serve meet fire dolphin tabor put lincoln team chance rookie kind elbow notion raven philly special suffer conference base possibility tenure watson arm open record strong lopsided abandon loss field samuel issue rhythm shoulder patient denver add business winless interim bone owner lose debut kevin eagle plan james pitiable resume practice throw houston virtual torn functional philadelphia cornerback snap woe hold trading bay offense tiebreaker short seed joe promote buccaneer atlanta lean talk ready trash south play complete unveil accord major consecutive championship race top ron system million contention perspective call reach physically worried winner purdy zip decent career confident manager sort predicament avoids straight news injury inglewood lead boyle tendon broken spent situation away picked francisco benefit position harsh plenty receiver lot coordinator characterization week comeback point day shape tim month young life consider achilles commander b explain football east win mvp orleans wide recovers tepper trade opportunity surround present host begin head reich different trail reaped ram remain angeles starter saint monday experience return time franchise offseason season superb bowl turn show league role texan quarterback edge dorian coach ownership march calculation nfl capable bronco financial saturday make david idea victory mark cut love,0.979,0.0,7.554964438122333,0.4019751474940155,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,"Still without a buyer, Nats enter the winter meetings in a familiar spot",2023-12-03 05:30:00,Chelsea Janes,"As the main event of baseball’s offseason begins Sunday with the start of the winter meetings in Nashville, the Washington Nationals find themselves in purgatory for the second straight year. While other clubs weigh their offseason moves and spending, the Nationals, mired in a rebuild, are instead muddling through continued uncertainty.In April 2022, the Lerner family announced it was open to exploring a sale of the team, and it remains so. But the family is not close to a sale, according to three people familiar with the matter, all of whom indicated that while Ted Leonsis, head of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, remains the likeliest eventual buyer, familiar long-standing obstacles remain.The list of obstacles has always started with the Lerner family’s expectations for a sale price.People familiar with those expectations have long suggested the Lerners hoped to sell the Nationals for something near the $2.4 billion Steve Cohen paid for the New York Mets in 2020, the previous time an MLB team was sold. That number always seemed high for a less established franchise in a smaller market, but the Lerners have seemed comfortable waiting until they received their desired price. Leonsis — who owns the NBA’s Wizards, the NHL’s Capitals and the WNBA’s Mystics — offered more than $2 billion for the Nationals last year, and the Lerners did not take it. Leonsis declined to comment for this story, though he has publicly acknowledged his interest in adding the Nationals to his holdings.“I am not shy to say I want to claim to buy a baseball team,” he said at Sportico’s Invest in Sports conference in October. “I love the sport.”The main complication remains the Nationals’ dispute with the Baltimore Orioles over broadcast rights and revenue. The Nationals’ TV rights are owned by the Orioles through Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN), and the teams have long disagreed over how much Baltimore should pay Washington. As a result, that revenue was tied up in the courts. This year, the sides reached an agreement in which the Orioles would pay the Nationals roughly $100 million in unpaid rights fees for the period from 2012 to 2016. And in November, an MLB-appointed committee ruled the Orioles owe the Nationals an average of $60 million in rights fees annually for the period from 2017 to 2021. But there is still no certainty about the value of the rights going forward.The Nationals still owe roughly $99 million over three years to Stephen Strasburg, who plans to retire, and $15 million annually through 2027 to Max Scherzer, who was traded in 2021. Ticket sales fell as the team’s on-field product suffered amid its rebuild — and the Nationals’ main suitor, Leonsis, has spent years building a Washington sports network and empire — so television revenue clarity has been and will be crucial.Leonsis recently acknowledged the boost baseball could provide an enterprise such as his Monumental Sports Network while he was speaking at Sports Business Journal’s Dealmakers conference.“We want to have year-round programming. That’s what we’re trying to do. That’s certainly what MSG has done, although they don’t have a baseball team,” said Leonsis, who was speaking to an investor in Madison Square Garden Network, home of the New York Rangers and Knicks. “So we want to have that year-round programming.”As a result, Mark Lerner, the Washington Nationals’ managing principal owner, and his tight circle of family partners are still operating the team as if they plan to own it indefinitely, shepherding the franchise through a rebuild they might not be around to see completed while also overseeing a dramatic restructuring of their baseball operations department.General Manager Mike Rizzo and Manager Dave Martinez received multiyear contract extensions late in the season and proceeded to make substantial changes to their supporting casts, including the purge of several longtime special assistants to Rizzo. The team is in transition on the field and off it — and potentially in the owner’s suite as well. The Nationals declined to comment.The most visible evidence of the uncertainty around the franchise might lie in its payroll: As things stand at the start of the winter meetings, the Nationals probably will begin next year with their lowest 162-game payroll since 2012, with just more than $100 million committed to the roster in 2024, according to Cot’s Baseball Contracts. As things stand, the Nationals would start next season with the 19th-highest payroll in MLB.That number is somewhat deceptive because $35 million of that total is owed to Strasburg. Another $24 million is owed to Patrick Corbin for the final season of the six-year deal the left-hander signed when the Nationals were pushing for the World Series. In short, the Nationals have committed somewhere around $40 million to the bulk of their big league roster for next season, and they are not expected to spend much on free agents this offseason, either. For reference, the only team projected to have an Opening Day payroll below $40 million is the Oakland Athletics.The lack of spending on the roster as well as the purge of front-office operatives could reasonably be interpreted as signs that the Lerner family wants to pare down spending to make the franchise more appealing to a potential buyer — or at least make it cheaper to operate while it considers its options. But multiple people with direct knowledge of the organization’s spending decisions suggested that when it comes to the roster, a potential sale is not the reason for the stinginess.Instead, the Nationals’ unwillingness to bid on top-dollar free agents this offseason is largely because they believe they are not one or two stars away from contention — at least not yet. They will be interested in bolstering their starting pitching depth around a young core. They might pursue a first baseman and an outfielder. They are not, Rizzo said at the general managers meetings in November, at the point of seeking to bring in an established star to help turn the team into a winner, as they did with Jayson Werth ahead of the 2011 season.“Financially, that doesn’t come into play. I think it’s, ‘When are you ready to strike, and what player is that guy?’ ” Rizzo said. “Those are the two questions you have to answer. Is this the right year — meaning is the right guy there who puts you over the top?”Then, Rizzo said, the Nationals needed more than on-field help — they needed an overhaul in clubhouse and franchise culture to turn an expansion franchise into a credible winner. Now, he says, the culture is established.",6595,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/nats-sale-update-winter-meetings/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,credible max oakland market agent offer sell martinez jayson instead paid contract york nashville guy purge pay masn madison recently leonsis mlb considers project werth building start unwillingness indefinitely remains purgatory oriole stand mystic empire depth potentially period rule sunday wnba steve boost love multiyear weigh operate entertainment answer april expansion comment oversee overhaul broadcast owe baltimore journal corbin family retire suitor free hop believe big fee fell publicly certainty sign winter washington dramatic tie complication push dave player acknowledge wait roster small assistant value obstacle interpret substantial ticket meeting announce pitch program receive matter operative low pursue ahead put transition longtime claim comfortable team indicate clarity garden unpaid amid star knowledge tight special suffer conference explore close price open home buy field lerner final square add strike sport spend business direct bulk expect operating owner shy meaning plan move tv find pare number mike familiar result suggest sportico roughly manage knicks mets reason decline revenue lie short agreement operation include probably ready enterprise stephen deceptive network commit average high baseball play complete disagreed accord circle opening strasburg top million proceed contention extension general reach bid interested winner annually rizzo lack manager television november straight muddle rebuild clubhouse core national spent patrick nhl partner dealmakers away appeal evidence monumental reference capital world point day desire speak side billion young event year spending establish change uncertainty bring buyer restructuring story shepherd likeliest largely option baseman seek question trade ted cohen financially ranger begin head nba support invest october expectation msg visible decision time court deal provide franchise continued offseason season payroll list long interest league turn principal cast multiple late potential series culture cheaper dispute investor previous cot make organization mire eventual product bolster outfielder mark committee club suite total scherzer wizard,0.99215,0.045489006823351,9.459855653568564,0.420883348475941,0,2023-12-03
ABC,"Michigan vs Alabama, Washington vs. Texas in College Football Playoff; unbeaten Florida St left out",2023-12-03 02:43:00,RALPH D. RUSSO AP college football writer,"Michigan, Washington, Texas and Alabama were selected to the College Football Playoff on Sunday, making Florida State the first unbeaten Power Five conference champion to be excluded from the four-team field.Michigan will face Alabama in the Rose Bowl and Washington will play Texas in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 and the winners will meet for the national championship Jan. 8 in Houston.The final season of the four-team playoff before it expands to 12 next year presented the CFP selection committee with the toughest decision in the 10-year history of the postseason system.“Florida State is a different team than they were through the first 11 weeks,” said selection committee chairman Boo Corrigan, who is also the athletic director of Florida State's Atlantic Coast Conference rival North Carolina State.The Seminoles (13-0) lost star quarterback Jordan Travis to a season-ending injury two weeks ago, but continued to win with a backup and then a third-string quarterback. But the committee is instructed to judge the teams for what they are heading into the playoff and decided FSU without Travis was not among the best four in the country.""To eliminate them from a chance to compete for a national championship is an unwarranted injustice that shows complete disregard and disrespect for their performance and accomplishments. It is unforgivable,” Florida State athletic director Michael Alford said.Travis is a sixth-year player whose development into one of the best quarterbacks in college football has fueled Florida State's resurgence over the last three years.“Devastated. heartbroken,” Travis posted on the social media platform X. “I wish my leg broke earlier in the season so y’all could see this team is much more than the quarterback. I thought results matter. 13-0 and this roster matches up across any team in those top 4 rankings. I am so sorry.”Whichever team was left out had a good argument to get in. That created unprecedented controversy and the committee passed over FSU to pick Alabama, which upset Georgia to win the Southeastern Conference championship, and Big 12 champion Texas, which beat the Crimson Tide on the road in September.The SEC had never missed the playoff. Alabama, which is in for the eighth time, kept that streak alive.Texas would have been just the second Power Five team with only one loss to be left out. Instead, the Longhorns will be making their first appearance in the CFP in their last season as a member of the Big 12. Texas moves to the SEC next year.Texas and Alabama were ranked seventh and eighth, respectively, in the committee's penultimate rankings and are now the first teams to jump from outside the top six in the second-to-last rankings into the playoff field. Georgia became the first team to enter championship weekend No. 1 and fail to make the field.“We had eight really good teams this year, somewhat of a unique year in the last year of the four,” Corrigan said.Big Ten champion Michigan is making its third straight appearance in the CFP, still looking for its first playoff victory. The Wolverines, who have stayed unbeaten amid an NCAA investigation into allegations of in-person scouting and sign-stealing, are the favorites to win the national title, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.Michigan opened as a 1 1/2-point favorite against Alabama.Washington is in the CFP for the second time, breaking the Pac-12's playoff drought after six years, and doing so the year before it leaves the conference for the Big Ten. The Huskies opened as a 4 1/2-point underdog to Texas and former Washington coach Steve Sarkisian. The two played last season in the Alamo Bowl and Washington won.Florida State, which was No. 4 in the previous CFP rankings, appeared to be on the way to its second playoff appearance in mid-November when the trajectory of their season changed drastically. Travis suffered a serious injury in the first quarter against North Alabama and was lost for the year.The Seminoles beat rival Florida last week with backup quarterback Tate Rodemaker. Then Rodemaker missed the ACC championship against Louisville with a concussion. Florida State stayed unbeaten with a strong defensive performance, but scored only one touchdown.ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips, who was among conference leaders who helped slow down the expansion process by a year after the SEC's plan to add Texas and Oklahoma was revealed in 2021, called leaving out the 'Noles “unfathomable.”“Their exclusion calls into question the selection process and whether the committee's own guidelines were followed, including the significant importance of being an undefeated Power Five conference champion,” Phillips said.Georgia's slim hopes of trying for a third consecutive national title also came to an end. The Bulldogs (12-1) had a 29-game winning streak snapped Saturday by the Crimson Tide.___",4846,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/sec-unbeaten-p5-left-final-4-team-college-105339538,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/323f908b-856f-417c-a815-9441f5e701f3/wirestory_8b9db687b7cf159779930298d2f1a388_16x9.jpg?w=992,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,power unbeaten pass title member alford selection instead played penultimate trajectory wolverine concussion tide sarkisian leg seminole scout former pick ranking sunday steve boo hope toughest postseason reveal expansion unwarranted fuel quarter slow big drastically champion create washington travis rival playoff left phillips player underdog favorite disrespect whichever roster ago x enter coast social unique decide follow carolina meet bulldog exclude matter instruct heartbroken controversy significant seventh undefeated broke country team chance fsu star amid ten unforgivable injustice expands sec suffer conference fanduel appearance eliminate open strong loss field final leaf judge add leader jump lose devastate select medium guideline plan louisville move accomplishment ranked result match respectively snap earlier oklahoma platform rodemaker athletic corrigan include post atlantic compete development play complete accord eighth consecutive alabama championship commissioner tate top wish longhorn call break winner investigation chairman exclusion college michael straight director injury upset importance national unprecedented sugar beat leave michigan fail week husky florida disregard resurgence year texas drought change football backup win crimson question defensive present argument head different alamo weekend allegation slim streak cfp georgia decision time committee continued season southeastern bowl show score stayed acc process rise quarterback coach jordan previous road saturday make miss ncaa victory performance north history state,0.4076999999999999,0.2476269087907552,11.148644264194669,0.3814670138888889,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,Capitals can’t match Golden Knights’ vigor and fall to reigning champs,2023-12-03 02:11:00,Bailey Johnson,"LAS VEGAS — For 20 minutes, the Washington Capitals mostly kept up with the defending Stanley Cup champions. But when the Vegas Golden Knights got rolling, there was nothing the Capitals could do to slow them down.On Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena, the Golden Knights were out to exact revenge from the shutout loss they suffered in Washington in mid-November. They did exactly that in a 4-1 win — the same margin as the first meeting, which the Capitals won 3-0, but the opposite result.Washington won the Stanley Cup at T-Mobile Arena in 2018, but in the regular season, it has been a winless building for the Capitals. They are 0-5-1 in six regular season games there since Vegas entered the league.Saturday’s game exposed the differences between the Capitals, a team hoping to stay on the playoff bubble, and the Golden Knights, who are a Stanley Cup contender once again.Even as Washington has racked up wins recently — two in a row before Saturday and five in a row from Nov. 10 to Nov. 22, for seven wins in its past 10 games — the margins have been narrow. In many of those games, the Capitals have been outplayed for much of the night, with airtight goaltending allowing them to eke out a win despite playing against the puck for most of the game. Even against Anaheim on Thursday, a game that featured an offensive outburst from one of the league’s worst offenses for a 5-4 win, the final margin was still just one goal.Goalie Darcy Kuemper made 32 saves on 35 shots Saturday, but Washington couldn’t generate much, if any, offense to support his effort in net.“We really struggled to get pucks to the interior,” Capitals Coach Spencer Carbery said. “Whether that’s a shot, whether that’s looking for a pass, whether it’s looking for a high tip, anything to get a puck to the interior. You’ve got to give them credit. They do a really good job. But at the same time, I think we’ve got some good players too that should be able to get pucks to the interior. We just weren’t nearly good enough at being able to do that.”The first period was fairly even between the two teams, and the Capitals even led in shot attempts, 21-14. The Golden Knights pulled ahead on a power-play goal from Jonathan Marchessault at 8:53, but in a road game against one of the top teams in the league, it was a decent enough opening 20 minutes for Washington.When the puck dropped for the second period, it quickly became clear that Vegas had leveled up and Washington didn’t have another level to reach. Shots on goal were 10-5 in favor of the Golden Knights after the first period. After the second period, it was 27-9.“A lot of turnovers,” defenseman John Carlson said. “A lot of failed, not even turnovers, but failing to execute out of the zone. They’re a good team. They’re tough on pucks. They swarm hard. They make it difficult on you. They’re a good team. We’re capable of executing. When you fall behind the eight-ball against a good team, they kind of get the rollover effect. It’s tough to get out of that, and we didn’t do it.”Added Carbery: “I thought our start was fine. In the second period, they took over, and we weren’t able to generate nearly enough, as we need to, puck possession-wise.”The lone goal Vegas scored in the second period was a breakaway for Jack Eichel; the Capitals killed the three penalties they took in the frame, but spending six minutes on the penalty kill in a single period helped prevent Washington from establishing any sort of momentum.“Penalties are an issue, so then we lose momentum there, but also just the recognition of that,” Carbery said. “You’ve got to find a way to create an [offensive] zone shift. When the ice starts to tilt — we’ve had an issue with this all year, recognizing momentum and finding [how to] change momentum.”Eichel set up Mark Stone for the Golden Knights’ third goal just 49 seconds into the third period. Vegas somewhat took its foot off the gas after that, and the Capitals began to find more success in the offensive zone, but the damage had already been done.Tom Wilson scored to end Vegas goalie Logan Thompson’s shutout bid with 3:14 left to play. It was too little, too late for Washington.“I thought everyone played a lot better once we got down 3-0, but obviously at that point, it’s too late,” center Dylan Strome said. “We left Kuemps out to dry. Just not good enough, nine shots through two periods. We’ve got to reassess and play better coming up on Monday.”",4435,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/capitals-golden-knights-road-trip/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,golden interior prevent job recently played attempt ice reassess night hard building start generate contender exact shift stay dry puck game period tough set save gas marchessault eke swarm minute hop airtight slow champion create jack washington knight playoff quickly left player difficult give zone offensive enter recognition meeting regular defend outplayed goaltending drop lone rollover row ahead fall fairly team stone center past fine success kind strome suffer vega favor turnover darcy recognize loss foot issue final difference wilson add carbery winless pull lose single find jonathan carlson logan struggle opposite offense thursday penalty stanley arena rack high play effort momentum margin kill opening top effect reach bid level decent cup sort kuemps lead goal revenge john lot capital fail point anaheim outburst bubble execute shutout eichel expose spending establish year change roll feature spencer win shot frame narrow begin breakaway despite defenseman support credit thompson monday damage time season tip kuemper tilt league goalie score late coach dylan capable road saturday make mark clear,0.07145,0.2029312288613303,5.96313559322034,0.4088676601176602,0,2023-12-03

""But like Kobe Bryant said, 'the job's not done.'""And with No. 1 Georgia falling to No. 8 Alabama in the Southeastern Conference title game, Harbaugh and the Wolverines are poised -- finally -- to claim the top playoff seed and reach No. 1. Harbaugh became the first coach in conference history to win three straight outright titles and he celebrated by running evasively to avoid getting doused in a Gatorade bath.Michigan also extended its school record of consecutive wins over Big Ten foes to 25. Corum tied Anthony Thomas' school career rushing touchdown mark. Corum, the league's running back of the year, finished with 16 carries for 52 yards. J.J. McCarthy, who was selected the conference's best quarterback this week, was 22 of 30 for 147 yards, and the defense made it all hold up.""My only focus is to come out here and attack and take advantage of every opportunity we have,"" Wolverines defensive back Mike Sainristil, the game's MVP, said on Fox's postgame show. ""Do everything I can to execute the game plan.""For the Hawkeyes, it was more of the same.While the defense held stout -- allowing touchdowns on drives of 5 and 6 yards and four field goals -- the offense produced just 155 yards and became only the second team in Big Ten title game history to be shut out in the final season of the East-West division format. Ohio State opened that era with a 59-0 rout over Wisconsin in 2014.Deacon Hill went 18 of 32 with 120 yards and the Hawkeyes rushed for 35 yards on 24 carries. The loss snapped a four-game winning streak and was the second in three years for Iowa in the title game against Michigan.The difference: The Wolverines capitalized on Iowa's errors; the Hawkeyes could not do the same.Michigan jumped to a 10-0 lead after making a 35-yard field goal on its first possession and Corum powered in from 3 yards out two plays after Semaj Morgan broke free for an 87-yard punt return to set a Big Ten title game record.Corum is the only FBS offensive or defensive player who has scored in every game this season.He scored again early in the second half when a replay review overturned an incompletion and ruled it was a fumble. Michigan recovered and outgoing Iowa offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz compounded the problem by drawing a penalty for unsportsmanlike penalty, moving the ball to the 6. following. That made it 17-0.Michigan closed it out with three field goals, the final one being a 50-yarder from James Turner to set a title-game record.Iowa's best scoring chance came after a 25-yard punt put it at the Michigan 38. Three plays later, though, Jaziun Patterson lost a fumble at the Michigan 30.Harbaugh missed six games this season because of suspension and yet Michigan heads into the postseason undefeated for the second straight year.""Before, he had to lead from the back. Today, he had the opportunity to lead from the front,"" Sainristil said of Harbaugh. ""He's a very big presence on the sideline.""When asked about his feeling on seeding in the CFP and what Michigan could accomplish in the new year, Sainristil added simply that ""this team is focused on winning something bigger.""",3482,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/michigan-wolverines-blank-iowa-hawkeyes-win-big-ten/story?id=105336976,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,crown power anthony problem lose select plan title move james semaj outgo gatorade mike error carry half job snap harbaugh simply ball punt yard hold offense division seed penalty wolverine review fbs play consecutive held alabama rush foe finish top game incompletion evasively rule thomas format reach set celebrate postseason career bryant overturn douse drive shut presence straight lead sideline goal unsportsmanlike free replay defense big michigan coordinator week draw fox execute stout mccarthy tie capitalize playoff year focus extend player feel sainristil ohio win mvp poise outright avoid recover offensive defensive opportunity early patterson hill follow today head kobe back compound fumble suspension front corum possession morgan run school fall attack streak put cfp georgia return claim broke undefeated team time chance advantage jumped ten season southeastern special touchdown postgame league conference rout show score jaziun finally close quarterback hawkeyes record open coach state strong ferentz accomplish loss field make wisconsin iowa produce final turner miss difference mark add brian history,0.83485,0.0,7.900727802037842,0.3642652084757348,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Florida State tops Louisville for first ACC title since 2014,2023-12-02 23:59:00,ANDREA ADELSON,"""I don't think there is a conversation,"" Florida State coach Mike Norvell said during his postgame news conference. ""This is a team that is well deserving. This is a team that has earned it. This is a team that has showed up consistently and proven that they have what it takes to win.""Even without veteran starter Jordan Travis, out for the season because of a leg injury. Even without backup Tate Rodemaker, out for Saturday's game because of a concussion.Without them, Glenn got the start and looked like a true freshman who enrolled in school in January, going 8-of-21 for 55 yards -- the second fewest in a conference championship win over the past 20 seasons. And yet, Florida State overcame injuries to its top two quarterbacks to win its first ACC title since 2014 -- a triumphant moment for Norvell, who took over the program at rock bottom in 2020 and built it all the way back up.The fact that Florida State won this title without Travis -- its team leader instrumental in the program turnaround -- is a testament to the work the entire team has put in to get the program to this moment. As the final moments ticked away, the crowd chanted, ""F-S-U!""""We just beat a top-15 team with a true freshman quarterback,"" Norvell said. ""Like that doesn't matter. I don't care perspective, what people think. We win. I believe in this team. I believe in what they can do. I believe in who they are.""So I don't really care about what everybody else's opinions are. I know who I coach, and they're going to go fight for everything they get because they've been doing it the last four years, and whatever the next opportunity is, I promise you they're going to show up.""Will that be enough for the playoff committee? ACC commissioner Jim Phillips said he believes it should be.""Finishing the regular season undefeated and now winning the ACC football championship game is a historic feat,"" Phillips told ESPN. ""There is no doubt that Florida State is among the best four teams in the country and has earned a place in the College Football Playoff. History has shown that the CFP committee consistently honors Power 5 undefeated champions, like Florida State. It's been a terrific year for FSU and the entire ACC, and we have the utmost confidence in the committee and expect FSU to be recognized as one of the four best and most deserving teams among the playoff participants.""The Seminoles' offense struggled to move the ball Saturday. Its most effective play was the Wildcat run with backup running back Lawrance Toafili, who finished with a game-high 118 yards and a touchdown to provide the spark the Seminoles needed. Norvell said the Wildcat package was added late in the week to try to gain an edge on a good run defense.""I was just trying to be ready for my moment, trying to make it happen if it needed to be done,"" Toafili said.While all the focus will be on quarterback -- and whether Florida State is good enough at that position to merit a playoff spot, although Rodemaker is expected to be 100% healthy for the bowl game -- perhaps the committee will take a look at what the Seminoles did defensively in this game. Florida State was suffocating, overwhelming the Louisville offensive line for most of the game. The Seminoles finished with a season-high seven sacks, 14 tackles for loss, five quarterback hurries and nine pass breakups en route to shutting down one of the best rushing offenses in the ACC.Defensive tackle Braden Fiske -- whom one Louisville assistant during pregame warmups pointed out was the player they were most concerned about -- had nine tackles, a career-high three sacks, 4.5 tackles for loss and two quarterback hurries.""I've just been waiting for my opportunity to come,"" Fiske said. ""I knew it was coming. I was excited for the opportunity, and once it finally happened, it's there.""As for why he believes Florida State should make the playoff, Fiske said, ""13-0 speaks for itself. I've been asked, and that's all I'm going to say. I'll let them make the decision, but if you're going to talk about best teams, 13-0 is one of them.""Florida State has won 19 straight games, second most in the country behind Washington (20).Louisville had its chances but failed to take advantage. Sixth-year starting quarterback Jack Plummer struggled badly, overthrowing receivers while going 14-of-36 for 111 yards and an interception.Twice in the second half Louisville had the ball inside the Florida State 15-yard line. Twice the Cards failed to score a touchdown. The first time, Louisville got down to the 7, but Jamari Thrash was tackled for a 9-yard loss and the Cardinals settled for a field goal. The second time, Louisville was set up in great position after pressuring punter Alex Mastromanno, who couldn't even get the punt off and had to fall on the ground to cover up the ball. Louisville started at the Florida State 12, but Tatum Bethune intercepted Plummer in the end zone to end that drive.The Louisville defense had its opportunities too. Twice on the same drive in the third quarter with the Seminoles up 10-0, Louisville dropped interceptions that would have given the offense prime field position inside the Florida State 30. Jaylin Alderman and Ben Perry had the ball in their hands but couldn't secure it.Florida State has the fewest turnovers in the country this season with five. Even with a freshman quarterback, the Seminoles somehow avoided giving the ball away. Florida State has allowed negative yardage in the fourth quarter of back-to-back games -- the first team to do so in at least the past 20 years.So now, it is a waiting game for the ACC champions. There has never been an undefeated Power 5 champion left out of the playoff. Even with a third-string quarterback, Florida State did enough to finish 13-0 -- with two wins against SEC opponents. Its defense put forward a resounding statement not only Saturday night, but last week in a win over Florida too.""We can stack our defense up against any offense in the nation,"" Florida State athletic director Michael Alford told ESPN. ""And given a month to prepare, our offense will be ready. This is why we play the game. Otherwise, let's just sit around and see who the oddsmakers pick and do away with the committee. Because if they leave out FSU, they will significantly damage the legitimacy of the CFP.""Florida State defensive end Jared Verse put it this way: ""The committee's going to do what needs to be done. We're a Power 5 champion. We just showed we have a defense that can play lights out with anybody in the country. What needs to be done will be done.""As for whether Florida State can compete with anyone who makes the playoff, Verse added, ""Anyone that they put before us is in for a rude awakening.""Behind Verse, Fiske and others, the defense showed its full potential Saturday night, and yet there is concern it might not be enough for the selection committee.",6885,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/florida-state-tops-louisville-acc-title-2014/story?id=105336061,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,power chant overwhelm braden title alford selection secure effective enrol conversation pressure prime perry punter place ball jaylin yard night veteran great start alex forward leg mastromanno excite seminole speaks jared rush finish pick game concern happen alderman healthy set doubt terrific spot shut drive lawrance settle moment negative route fourth sack thrash quarter defensively full believe defense espn promise wildcat concerned champion tatum hurry jack washington travis toafili playoff left phillips player freshman historic light wait yardage zone give assistant offensive knew significantly regular back program matter drop cover opponent fall put undefeated country team past chance crowd fsu warmups legitimacy fight sec conference suffocate instrumental intercept turnover recognize loss field final add leader proven participant overcame ticked pregame expect plummer louisville move rock mike interception work half nation entire line stack norvell struggle jamari package punt offense rodemaker athletic earn hand talk rude ready fact card glenn compete play championship commissioner tate confidence top january perspective feat college michael oddsmakers straight news injury director told honor utmost deserve goal ground beat away inside leave position merit receiver fail week point month florida bottom focus year prepare backup football win fiske verse avoid triumphant opportunity defensive consistently breakup statement run school starter cfp damage cardinal decision time overthrow advantage provide badly season bethune touchdown postgame bowl testament show score acc late potential finally quarterback edge coach awaken spark built resound jordan turnaround saturday make committee history tackle opinion state,0.981,0.130718954248366,7.42917818181818,0.4246887774061686,0,2023-12-02

But on Saban's mind, and many others, was what will happen Sunday when the College Football Playoff committee chooses the four teams that will play for the national championship.Saban said it was pretty simple.""If they really want the four best teams to compete,"" he said, then Alabama will be in the playoff.The comment came after his No. 8 Crimson Tide snapped the Bulldogs' 29-game winning streak with a 27-24 victory at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. It was Saban's ninth SEC title at Alabama and extended the team's winning streak to 11 games since a Week 2 home loss to Texas.It's that loss that has everybody in Crimson, and a few folks in the SEC offices, a tad nervous.Saban didn't go overboard during his postgame news conference, but he left little doubt of his belief that his team is one of the best in college football.""We beat the No. 1 team in the country, and they won 29 straight games,"" Saban said.

Milroe said as he scanned the room full of reporters. ""You beat the No. 1 team. What do you consider us?""At the end of the day, that's out of our reach [the playoff selections].

But since that game -- and since he was given the entire set of keys to Alabama's offense -- he has accounted for 28 touchdowns against just five turnovers.He passed for 192 yards and two touchdowns against Georgia. And it was his play in the fourth quarter that proved to be the difference. The 6-foot-2, 220-pound redshirt sophomore was masterful during a 75-yard touchdown drive that put Alabama ahead 27-17, and his 30-yard run on first down after Georgia pulled within 27-24 was the dagger for the Bulldogs.""The biggest thing about this team is we know there's unfinished business,"" Milroe said.Saban had a little fun with the media as he settled into his seat for his postgame news conference.""I know you're going to ask me, so I might as well just get to it,"" he said with a big smile.

Washington Post,Michigan shuts out Iowa to earn its spot in an uncertain playoff field,2023-12-02 23:37:00,Chuck Culpepper,"INDIANAPOLIS — They started talking about “the worm” after midnight at the Big Ten championship game, and how this putative worm has turned, whereupon Jim Harbaugh mentioned that sometimes the worm gets “pretty slippery” but that the Michigan players he adores managed to put “a hook in it.”How multiple worms have turned as of this first Sunday in December.No. 2 Michigan (13-0), after its wrestling match of a 26-0 win over offenseless Iowa for a third straight Big Ten title, has gone from mere national contender (September) to center of football espionage and behind-the-curtain intrigue with the loud sign-scouting saga (October, November) to the Saturday night lovefest on the field and the interview dais among a reinstated, exhilarated Harbaugh and three elite players (December). Meanwhile, as Michigan stands among only two doubtless College Football Playoff entrants, the other being Washington, the worm of the national season has turned with such dizziness that this selection committee has by far the roughest task of the 10 committees so far in the four-team playoff concept: For its announcement coming at noon Sunday, it must choose two from among Florida State (13-0), Texas (12-1), Alabama (12-1) and Georgia (12-1).There’s no such muddle around Michigan even if its triumph over Iowa ought to have occurred in mud for all its inelegance. Now that the Wolverines have gone from a second-tier program with a storied past for much of the century to an elite program with a storied future for the past three seasons, it’s time to note the worm. “‘Coach’ is probably going to say it,” said Mike Sainristil, the Haiti-born, Massachusetts-raised defensive back and delight who won MVP of Saturday’s game with two forced fumbles and a pass breakup. “I’m going to say it before he says it: The worm has turned around here.”“I was going to say that!” Harbaugh exclaimed while seated to Sainristil’s immediate right, shortly before reiterating for those who didn’t know: “The worm has turned.”It even turned all the way to the trophy presentation, which managed to avoid awkwardness because Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti did not have to hand Harbaugh the trophy four weeks after suspending Harbaugh from the sideline for three games including the Ohio State doozy. That’s because a deft Harbaugh requested that Petitti present it to Zak Zinter, the Michigan offensive lineman horridly injured on Nov. 25 against Ohio State, yet present here days after surgery as a part of the team in a different manner.Within recent years, Michigan has turned this so-called worm from a program that hadn’t won an outright Big Ten title since 2003, a program tucked in whatever tier lies below the elites, to a program with three straight outright conference titles, unprecedented for one coach, and three straight playoff nods. “We’ve kind of changed the narrative, how people view Michigan,” star running back Blake Corum said after rushing for two touchdowns to equal Michigan’s all-time mark at 55. They’ve gone from 49-22 in Harbaugh’s first six seasons to 38-3 in the ensuing three.Then, within this season, Michigan has gone through those magnifying-glass stages, including the one of resentment and Michigan vs. everybody when Harbaugh vowed he would be in court to appeal his suspension. (It never went that way.) Then he viewed from several streets away the wins over Penn State, Maryland and Ohio State while suspended as assistant Sherrone Moore coached, until Saturday night when Harbaugh returned and wound up bustling around the field in the postgame, hugging everybody and his place kicker, saying the word “wonderful” at least dozens of times and saying to Sainristil on the dais, “Congratulations to Mikey.”“Congratulations to you, Coach!” the fifth-year senior said up there. “Welcome back!”“I never left!” said Harbaugh, who technically did coach the practices.Now after holding Iowa’s No. 133-ranked offense to 155 total yards, and scrapping with Iowa’s No. 2-ranked defense for 213, and beating No. 16 Iowa (10-3) with four field goals from James Turner and two touchdown drives covering five and six yards (after Semaj Morgan’s 87-yard punt return set up one and Sainristil’s forced fumble the other), Michigan rests. It rests until it takes its great offensive line (if diminished by the absence of Zinter) and its great turnover margin (24-7) and tries to improve its 0-2 record in these playoffs. By then, the worm may have wiggled again as the sign story floats to the playoff, and whatever lingering questions hover about legitimacy and about what the ongoing NCAA investigation might wind up doing to all of this.Before that, and after midnight, they evoked a grand happiness, another stage in the turning series.“Love you guys,” Harbaugh said to Sainristil, Corum and quarterback J.J. McCarthy.“Love you, Coach,” they said back.He went on about Sainristil, another case of the bridge of sports, a 59-year-old coach born to a coaching family in Toledo talking with intricate knowledge about a 23-year-old player born to a radio newsroom director’s family in Haiti before emigrating. “When a play has to be made,” Harbaugh said, “when the magic has to happen, Mikey makes it happen.” He called Sainristil “a stalwart,” praised his combination of being “a superior athlete and a guy that does everything right,” and said, “He’s just so, so elite.”The feel-great session hit regular choruses, as when Harbaugh spoke yet again about Corum’s father and spoke of “just how proud James Corum has to be,” and said of James, “He’s such a good man, such a great friend.” Harbaugh went on a tale about how after winning the Big Ten in 2021, he went to visit tight end Colston Loveland who hails from Idaho, and Harbaugh lost his wallet, and he felt “kind of bummed I lost my wallet,” but then he would quell that thought with this one: “Big Ten champions.”It all felt like normal again in a season starkly abnormal in Michigan and now wildly abnormal in the nation, as two fan bases are about to begin seething for merely the remainder of their lives, rehashing forever the details that led to the injustice, such as Texas beating Alabama and Alabama beating Georgia and nobody ending up beating Florida State.Near the end of the Michigan talk, though, certainty reigned, and the worm had settled in for at least a bit, and Sainristil went on a block-paragraph soliloquy about Harbaugh and the program, ending it with, “We’re direct reflections of how Coach Harbaugh treats us.”As the news conference moved on to another question, and attention turned toward that, Harbaugh gently poked Sainristil from the next seat.",6634,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/02/michigan-iowa-big-ten-championship/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,immediate soliloquy title newsroom selection word improve guy place offenseless elite remainder harbaugh delight yard born night tucked mention narrative wolverine great start lovefest reinstate nod contender adores stand detail technically wiggle rush exclaim surgery penn toledo treat game sunday wonderful session happen september putative set equal attention drive storied deft settle view sideline occur family inelegance injured dizziness ensue defense big exhilarate absence sign bridge certainty washington playoff note left happiness bit player ohio magic senior outright assistant offensive felt welcome regular back program intrigue shortly recent espionage abnormal cover corum float morgan december wind evoke put team center past part star knowledge ten tight colston kind legitimacy zinter choose lineman injustice conference base hook resentment saga vowed mikey proud moore record street slippery turnover rest field tier iowa kicker wildly future sport direct starkly trophy lose wallet move james hail stalwart semaj mike bum coached worm match nation line manage punt hug hold offense lie entrant forever hand include talk probably task chorus reflection play triumph gently alabama championship tony indianapolis commissioner margin spoke interview hover father wound midnight doubtless call normal blake investigation college wrestling november ongoing straight news request concept muddle lead director loud poked national goal announcement unprecedented reiterate away diminish appeal case beating michigan loveland intricate week day florida doozy praise horridly life sherrone year texas change force football sainristil congratulation story win mvp stage mud avoid question noon scrap roughest grand defensive radio linger suspend present breakup reign begin different suspension fumble century october dozen seat run idaho georgia return time court athlete quell season dais hit touchdown postgame turn presentation multiple maryland quarterback pretty superior coach visit combination seethe awkwardness rehash saturday turner make zak haiti ncaa mark emigrate petitti bustling committee love total state,0.99495,0.1808863430810973,8.537528430629262,0.408619251119251,0,2023-12-02
ABC,Emanuel Miller wins it for TCU despite stepping out of bounds ahead of shot,2023-12-02 23:19:00,ABC News,"But not without some controversy.Replay showed Miller stepped on the right sideline with his left foot just before releasing the ball. Though officials reviewed the play, because they missed Miller stepping out-of-bounds in real time, by rule they couldn't overturn the shot.Jayden Epps sank a pair of foul shots with 2.7 seconds left to give Georgetown an 83-81 lead. On the inbounds, TCU's Micah Peavy ran the baseline and, like a quarterback rolling to the right to evade pressure, threw the ball on a near-straight line to Miller, who caught it, turned, took a dribble and launched it before falling to the floor.Despite the controversial ending, first-year Hoyas coach Ed Cooley said the one play wasn't the sole reason his team lost.""We had three of the best officials in America on our game today,"" he told reporters. ""High-level officials. Final Four officials. Regional final officials. The game is not defined by one play, all right, and that's what everybody is going to talk about.""We had opportunities throughout the game. We missed a lot of free throws, missed a couple of blockouts. Everybody's always going to think of the last play, 'What could've, should've.' Give them credit. They had to throw the pass, the kid caught it and made the shot.""Cooley did say he believes the rule in general should be evaluated.""If they can review it to see if he was out-of-bounds and it could be reversed, then I think we do have to take a look at that,"" he said. ""Not because we're on the other side, what's in the best interest of the game. Not so much what's in the best interest of Georgetown at this point. What's in the best interest of the game to keep the game fair, equitable and even across the board.""If he would have called him out-of-bounds and the ball went in, you can take a look at it and say, 'Well, no basket.' You look at it the other way, you can't make the call because there was no call on the floor. Maybe it's an opportunity for us to open up that and take a hard look at it to see if we can do that.""Miller finished with 29 points on 12-for-18 shooting, JaKobe Coles scored 17 points, and reserve Avery Anderson III had 11 for the undefeated Horned Frogs (7-0).Epps scored 24 points, Dontrez Styles scored 18, reserve Ismael Massoud scored 16 points, and Jay Heath scored 10 points for the Hoyas.The Horned Frogs led 44-36 at halftime and extended the lead to 51-36 two minutes into the second half before Georgetown began its rally.

Washington Post,TCU shocks Georgetown on a wild three-pointer at the buzzer,2023-12-02 20:25:00,Kareem Copeland,"Ed Cooley stood dumbfounded as TCU players sprinted across the court to pile on Emanuel Miller. The Horned Frogs forward had just banked in a running three-pointer from the right wing while falling down as time expired to give the Horned Frogs an impossible 84-83 win over Cooley’s Georgetown Hoyas on Saturday night.TCU, which was out of timeouts, had to go the length of the court in 2.7 seconds after two free throws by Jayden Epps put Georgetown up by two. The officials went to the scorer’s table to confirm Miller got his shot off in time, but replays made clear that he stepped out of bounds before the shot. However, out-of-bounds calls cannot be reviewed in that scenario, handing Cooley’s Hoyas a brutal defeat.“We had three of the best officials in America on our game today,” Cooley said. “The game is not defined by one play. And that’s all everybody’s going to talk about. We had opportunities throughout the game. We missed a lot of free throws, missed a couple of block-outs. Everybody’s always going to think about the last play, what could’ve, should’ve. Give [the Horned Frogs] credit. They had to throw the pass. The kid caught it, and he made the shot.”Cooley did say he thinks the rules for that situation should be reexamined in the offseason.But throughout Saturday’s second half, fans all around Capital One Arena were on their feet, pushing the decibels higher and higher in a sight rarely seen at a Georgetown home game in recent years. The ending was painful, but this was the type of atmosphere Cooley, the Hoyas’ first-year coach, had been seeking since he took the job.With the score tied at 81, Epps dribbled the clock under 10 seconds before heading into the paint and getting fouled. He converted both free throws, leaving him with a team-high 24 points. Dontrez Styles added 18, and Ismael Massoud posted 16.Cooley decided not to call a timeout after Supreme Cook grabbed a defensive rebound with 27 seconds left and the score tied, and he said afterward he wouldn’t have done that differently. He didn’t want TCU Coach Jamie Dixon to have a chance to set up his defense during a timeout. The only thing he considered was having Epps try to miss the second free throw on purpose, which would have kept TCU from having an opportunity to set up an out-of-bounds play.Dixon said the Horned Frogs ran a play they practice routinely for situations with less than three seconds remaining. To that, Miller laughed and said: “Every. Single. Day.”“It’s all about just staying composed in that moment,” he added. “[Micah Peavy] threw the ball — a great pass. It was pinpoint, on the spot. I felt a lot of little push on my hip, but it’s basketball — it’s contact. Just to be able to play through that, stay focused and hit that shot — it’s a moment I’ll never forget, but it happens because of my teammates.”Georgetown (5-3) saw its four-game winning streak end, while TCU remained perfect at 7-0.Georgetown appeared doomed after TCU opened the second half with a 7-0 run that left Cooley visibly frustrated and the Horned Frogs up 51-36. But the Hoyas rallied to grab a 64-63 lead, their first since being up 27-25 in the first half. Massoud made four threes in the second half as Georgetown started hitting shots from all over and the Hoyas’ defense picked up.TCU took a 44-36 lead to halftime thanks to a 16-4 stretch after a fast start by the Hoyas. Georgetown attacked the rim early and got to the free throw line while keeping the Horned Frogs from getting out in transition. That’s exactly what TCU wants to do — it entered Saturday as the No. 1 team in the nation with 30.5 fast-break points per game.The Hoyas’ early success didn’t last: TCU pounded the paint and began to find opportunities in transition, with its 16-4 run capped by a two-handed dunk to finish a fast break by Peavy.With his winning basket, Miller scored a game-high 29 points for TCU, and JaKobe Coles added 17.“That’s a different team than what they played the first five, six games,” Dixon said of Georgetown.Here’s what else to know about the Hoyas’ loss:The Hoyas were the biggest test of the young season for TCU, which entered with six blowouts on its résumé. None of those wins had come against a power conference team.Massoud played his second game in a Hoyas jersey after missing the season’s first six games with a broken hand. The Kansas State transfer came off the bench again but had a huge hand in the second-half comeback. The 6-foot-9 forward scored all 16 of his points in the second half, and he added 10 rebounds.“I know I could bring more to the table than scoring,” he said. “So I knew if I just kept positive and try and lead my team and try to be positive in that way, I knew eventually the game would turn around.”Dixon and Cooley acknowledged the game was physical, with Cooley comparing it to a Big East matchup. TCU’s Xavier Cork was assessed a flagrant-two foul with 16:47 left and the Hoyas trailing 53-41. Cooley said that was a spark for his team.“My kind of game, baby, my kind of game,” he said. “That’s Big East-style right there. Bodies are flying. Cursing’s going on; people upset. That’s my kind of game right there. Did [the flagrant foul] wake us up? Thousand percent. Everybody wants pretty-boy basketball. I want Big East basketball. That’s Big East basketball at its best.”",5319,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/02/georgetown-tcu-buzzer-beater/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dunk power cook step micah résumé hoya played ball great start forward timeouts stretch test emanuel stay frog matchup tcu caught finish rule game capped scorer set spot forget atmosphere moment free reexamine replay defense big positive cork kid rally define tie push left blowout player supreme acknowledge georgetown compose dumbfound give sight curse enter early knew felt decide painful official recent confirm massoud fall put transition expire type team chance xavier percent success purpose kind impossible bank conference frustrate pinpoint sprint kansa open transfer home afterward bench loss foot table add cole contact single find practice throw visibly half style body nation timeout pile grabbed line wing baby flagrant miller hand review talk arena hip post halftime epps high dixon play scenario assess horn laugh call break brutal upset lead broken basket eventually jamie clock situation picked leave lot dribble comeback fast capital couple point thousand young physical consider focus year bring east win decibel shot rebound seek defensive opportunity jersey threw america jakobe today head begin wake fly routinely different trail huge basketball length credit grab run attack streak differently paint remain peavy time court dontrez season stood hit perfect doom turn ran rarely score rim compare foul coach spark jayden cooley saturday make convert miss bound ismael clear state pound,0.9873,0.0564015792442188,6.147275985663082,0.3990804965236783,0,2023-12-02
ABC,"Alabama ends Georgia's 29-game win streak, takes SEC title",2023-12-02 20:09:00,ABC News,"Now, the big question: Is Georgia's bid for a third straight national title over?Iron Bowl hero Jalen Milroe threw a pair of touchdowns and No. 8 Alabama's defense dominated after giving up a score on Georgia's opening possession -- a compelling playoff statement for a Crimson Tide team that lost at home to Texas early in the season.Alabama (12-1) sorted out its quarterback situation and hasn't lost since. The victory over Georgia was the Tide's 11th in a row and may be good enough to push them from No. 8 in the CFP rankings to a prized berth in the final four.""This is a team. These guys here are what you call a team,"" Alabama coach Nick Saban said. ""This is a great team. They play together as a team. They overcame adversity. They showed today and proved that they can win against anybody.""Georgia (12-1) will have to hope its dominance over the past two seasons persuades the selection committee to give it a do-over in the playoffs. That's just what happened two years ago, when the Tide romped to a 41-24 victory over the top-ranked Bulldogs in the SEC title game and both teams advanced.""You're going to tell me, someone is sitting in that committee room and doesn't think that Georgia team is one of the best four teams, I don't know if they're in the right profession,"" Georgia coach Kirby Smart said, when asked about his team's case for a playoff berth. ""It's a really good football team.""Georgia avenged its SEC defeat that time with a 33-18 victory over Alabama in the national championship game, and the Bulldogs made it two titles in a row with a 15-0 season in 2022. Their hopes of becoming the first team in the poll era to win three straight titles is in the hands of others.Georgia closed the gap to 20-17 after a 28-yard punt return by little-used Anthony Evans III set up Carson Beck's sneak into the end zone for Georgia's first touchdown since the opening minutes.But, with a drive for the ages, Milroe hooked up with Isaiah Bond on four completions for 56 yards -- rekindling memories of a week earlier when the two connected on a fourth-and-31 touchdown pass that miraculously pulled out an Iron Bowl victory over Auburn last Saturday.Roydell Williams scored on a 1-yard run that restored Alabama's advantage to 27-17 with 5:47 remaining.Georgia didn't go quietly. The Bulldogs hustled down the field for another touchdown, scoring on Kendall Milton's fourth-and-goal run from the 1 with 2:52 left to again get within a field goal.But Milroe broke off a 30-yard run -- and wisely went down inbounds to keep the clock running -- and Alabama ran out the clock.Georgia marched down the field on its first possession, grabbing a 7-0 lead on Milton's 17-yard touchdown run.But the rest of the half belonged to the Crimson Tide, who outgained the Bulldogs 193 to 55 in total yards after Georgia's opening salvo.Groza Award finalist Will Reichard booted a 43-yard field goal to become the NCAA's leading career scorer with 533 points, breaking a tie with former Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds.Alabama was just getting warmed up.After missing on his first four passes, Milroe found his range. He completed six of eight for 110 yards, including touchdown passes of 28 yards to running back Jam Miller on a busted coverage and a 15-yarder to former Georgia receiver Jermaine Burton with 48 seconds left in the half.Miller's touchdown capped a 10-play, 92-yard drive, giving a huge boost of confidence to the Alabama offense. After Georgia's Peyton Woodring missed a potential tying field goal from 50 yards that deflected off the right upright, Milroe got the Tide rolling again.Malaki Starks was flagged for pass interference, Milroe converted on fourth-and-4 with a 22-yard pass to Bond and Burton hauled in a touchdown pass in the back of the end zone to send Alabama to the locker room with a 17-7 lead.It was only the fifth time that Georgia had trailed at the half since the start of its winning streak.This time, the Bulldogs couldn't come back.",3976,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/alabama-ends-georgias-29-game-win-streak-takes/story?id=105334474,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,pass title selection guy poll yard memory restore boot great tide completion start berth former saban ranking dominate game boost capped happen hope scorer set found drive compelling hooked connect send defense big dominance bust avenge tie playoff navy push left rekindle warm williams give zone ago early carson prove sneak bulldog back haul possession row isaiah milroe broke team past belong defeat burton sec beck milton hustle close starks home rest field persuades jam final jermaine overcame pull anthony lose reichard kendall prize half smart punt earlier offense miller upright deflect hand include coverage pair play complete bond romped alabama championship award flag opening confidence miraculously interference call bid break woodring career sort auburn room straight lead jalen national nick clock goal situation wisely locker case range receiver week point age profession hero year iii texas roll football win evans question crimson threw today statement trail iron huge finalist grab peyton run georgia cfp return keenan time advanced advantage kirby season touchdown bowl show ran adversity score inbounds potential quarterback outgained coach quietly march make convert miss ncaa victory committee total gap,0.99245,0.0754527162977867,8.844915032679733,0.4048552754435108,0,2023-12-02

ABC,No. 8 Alabama knocks off No. 1 Georgia 27-24 for SEC title. Both teams await postseason fate,2023-12-02 19:33:00,PAUL NEWBERRY AP sports writer,"ATLANTA -- After handing Georgia its first loss in nearly two years, Alabama mixed a raucous celebration of its latest Southeastern Conference championship with a whole lot of lobbying for a College Football Playoff spot that no one could've envisioned in September.Jalen Milroe, the quarterback who epitomizes the Crimson Tide's remarkable turnaround from an early-season loss to Texas, posed a pointed question to the committee that will decide who's in — and who's out.“Georgia is number one, right?” said Milroe, who was picked as MVP of a 27-24 victory Saturday that snapped the top-ranked Bulldogs' 29-game winning streak. “We just beat the number one team. What do you consider us?”Alabama would have to make a big leap from No. 8 in both the AP poll and the most recent CFP rankings — and perhaps leapfrog the No. 7 Texas team that beat it 34-24 in Tuscaloosa on Sept. 9 — to claim a spot in the four-team playoff that will be announced Sunday.Another big question: Is Georgia’s bid for a third straight national title over?Coach Kirby Smart bristled at the notion that his team — with two straight national titles on its resume — squandered a shot at becoming the first team in the AP poll era to win three championships in a row.“It’s the best four teams,” Smart said. “So if you go tell me somebody sitting in that committee room doesn’t think that Georgia team is one of the best four teams, I don’t know if they’re in the right profession because we're a really good football team.”After his Iron Bowl heroics a week earlier, Milroe threw a pair of touchdown passes and Alabama's defense dominated much of the way after giving up a score on Georgia's opening possession. It was the 30th SEC crown for the Tide — more than twice as many as any other school.“A lot of people doubted this team,” said Milroe, who was benched early in the season but bounced back to become one of college football's most dynamic players. ""I never gave up on this team. That's the biggest thing.”Alabama (12-1) sorted out its quarterback situation and hasn't lost since. The victory over Georgia was the Tide's 11th in a row and may be good enough to give them a big boost in the selection committee's eyes.“This is a team,” said Alabama coach Nick Saban, who may get a chance to add to his record seven national titles. “I've never been prouder of a group of guys.”Georgia (12-1) will have to hope its dominance over the last two seasons persuades the committee to provide a shot at a do-over in the playoff. That's just what happened two years ago, when Alabama romped to a 41-24 victory over the top-ranked Bulldogs in the SEC title game and both teams were invited to play on.Georgia avenged its SEC defeat with a 33-18 victory over Alabama in the national championship game, and the Bulldogs made it two titles in a row with a 15-0 season in 2022. Their hopes of a three-peat are now in the hands of others.“There's two classes of our kids that haven't lost a game,"" Smart said. ""In life, sometimes you can't get better until you lose.”Georgia closed the gap to 20-17 after a 28-yard punt return by little-used Anthony Evans III set up Carson Beck's sneak into the end zone for Georgia's first touchdown since the opening minutes.But, with a drive for the ages, Milroe hooked up with Isaiah Bond on four completions for 56 yards — rekindling memories of a week earlier when the two connected on a fourth-and-31 touchdown pass that miraculously pulled out an Iron Bowl victory over Auburn.Roydell Williams scored on a 1-yard run that restored Alabama's lead to 27-17 with 5:47 remaining.Georgia didn't go quietly. The Bulldogs hustled down the field for another TD, scoring on Kendall Milton's second touchdown of the game, a fourth-and-goal run from the 1 with 2:52 left to again climb within a field goal.But Milroe broke off a 30-yard run — wisely going down inbounds to keep the clock running — and Alabama ran out the clock.“Georgia's got a really good team,"" Saban said. “But our guys overcame. They proved today they can win against anybody.”After missing on his first four passes, Milroe found his range. He completed six of eight for 110 yards, including touchdown passes of 28 yards to running back Jam Miller on a busted coverage and a 15-yarder to former Georgia receiver Jermaine Burton with 48 seconds left in the half to give the Tide a 17-7 lead at the break.It was only the fifth time Georgia had trailed at the half since the start of its winning streak.This time, the Bulldogs couldn’t come back.THE TAKEAWAYAlabama: After getting shredded by Auburn’s running game the week before, the Crimson Tide held Georgia to 78 yards on the ground. That forced Beck and the Bulldogs to go to the air more than they would’ve liked. “They whipped us up front,” Smart said.Georgia: As was the case two years ago, the second quarter was the Bulldogs’ downfall. In the 2021 loss, they surrendered 24 points to Bryce Young and the Crimson Tide. This time, Alabama took control by outscoring Georgia 14-0 in the period.POINTS RECORDGroza Award finalist Will Reichard booted a 43-yard field goal in the first quarter to reach 533 career points and become the leading scorer in NCAA FBS history, breaking a tie with former Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds.Reichard added a 34-yard field goal and three extra points, boosting his total to 539 points.UP NEXTThat's in the hands of the CFP selection committee, which will announce the four playoff teams Sunday, as well as the rest of the New Year's Six bowl assignments.___Get alerts on the latest AP Top 25 poll throughout the season.

Washington Post,"With new coach watching from afar, USWNT gets a lift from win over China",2023-12-02 19:29:00,Steven Goff,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Five time zones and an ocean away in the cold of London, where her priorities remain until May, Emma Hayes planned to watch a live feed of her future disciples on the U.S. women’s national soccer team play in steamy South Florida on Saturday. It was their first match since Hayes, the longtime Chelsea coach, was appointed the next leader of the sport’s most decorated women’s program.Much of what she saw in a 3-0 victory over China probably pleased her, though the list of tasks remains substantial leading up to the Paris Olympics next summer.Washington Spirit star Trinity Rodman, among the key figures in U.S. efforts to rebound from last summer’s World Cup disappointment, posted a goal and two assists — then met one of her idols, retired tennis star Serena Williams.Sophia Smith and Lindsey Horan also scored as the United States extended its unbeaten streak since the World Cup to five games (with no goals conceded).“I hope she’s sleeping at this moment,” interim coach Twila Kilgore said of Hayes. “One hundred percent, she was watching. She was definitely watching live. I will look forward to talking to her when she’s ready and has time to do that and kind of get her viewpoint, and we’ll go from there.”Until she steps into her new role, Hayes will monitor the transitioning program from afar, collaborating with Kilgore on rosters, lineups and tactics. Hayes met with Kilgore and the players during training camp earlier in the week before returning home Thursday.Although there were not glaring changes to the approach Kilgore used in September and October camps, the players said they noticed greater energy and direction — and greater freedom to express themselves on the field.“Being able to meet Emma was the start of the foundation,” Rodman said. “I definitely feel like we’re starting to create that new identity. ... I don’t know if ‘relief’ is the word, but security of knowing who’s coaching us was a weight lifted off all of our shoulders.”Horan, the captain, said the team is making progress.“There were places and opportunities we could have been better. We could have capitalized more,” she said. “But it has been really nice having Emma for a few days, bringing that energy and presence.”Midfielders Jenna Nighswonger and Olivia Moultrie made their debuts, and center back Abby Dahlkemper returned from a 20-month absence following back surgery.In the second half, the lineup included Moultrie, 18; Rodman, 21; Jaedyn Shaw, 19; and Mia Fishel, 22.“It’s so fun to see people out there I have played [with] together for a long time,” Moultrie said. “The things we would talk about at [under-20 camp], ‘Oh, I hope we’re on the full team together someday.’ That’s super cool, just seeing the turnover and what’s coming.”Added Fishel: “I think we all felt that connection and how we want to play in the future.”The United States went ahead in the eighth minute following sustained possession. Naomi Girma’s long ball out of midfield liberated Rodman gaining separation on the left flank. In stride, Rodman sent a bending cross into the six-yard box, where a sliding Smith beat goalkeeper Xu Huan to the ball.Typically a wing on the national team, Smith started at center forward. The team’s longtime starter, Alex Morgan, was not selected to this roster amid a dip in her international form. Several other veterans also were passed over.Smith, the NWSL’s top scorer this season, enjoyed three additional chances before halftime.“We had some really, really good moments,” Kilgore said, “but we just need to be more clinical in our finishing.”Changes came in the second half. Fishel and Shaw displayed chemistry in the attack. Rose Lavelle, who started on the right side, shifted centrally. Moultrie and Shaw, whose U.S. career began in October, became the first teenagers since 2005 to debut in the same year.The lead grew in the 52nd minute on Horan’s accidental goal. After accepting Rodman’s pass, she chipped a long ball toward Shaw deep in the box. Shaw’s leap froze Xu momentarily. Shaw did not make contact, and the ball took a big hop into the right corner of the net.In the 77th minute, Shaw’s deflected cross fell to Rodman for a tap-in. After the game, Rodman enjoyed a bigger thrill.“I gave one of my jerseys away to a fan, and then I walked across the field, and somebody said, ‘Serena wants to meet you,’ ” Rodman said. “I was like, ‘Serena who?’ They were like, ‘Serena Williams.’ I walked over there, and she’s like, ‘Can I have your jersey?’ I was like, ‘Oh, my God.’ I dug in the dirty bag from the beginning of the half to find mine and gave it to her.”Notes: The third-ranked Americans will finish their 2023 schedule with a rematch against No. 15 China on Tuesday in Frisco, Tex. ...With the U.S. team in transition, Saturday’s match drew an announced 8,768 — the smallest home audience since February 2022. ...",4881,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/02/uswnt-china-friendly/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,unbeaten pass cross lineup step sleep word nice cool place girma jaedyn played ball super steamy flank relief veteran lindsey great start alex priority forward remains lavelle shift teenager hundred express leap ocean form finish game horan lauderdale freedom hope september scorer clinical idol notice moment energy minute concede nwsl retire xu hop definitely full rematch fun camp walk fort big absence fell cold create woman capitalize note left player feel summer sustain roster separation give feed zone small audience viewpoint bag drew felt substantial follow announce meet afar chipped back program weight possession morgan kilgore ahead transition stride longtime american team center chance amid star centrally fishel percent kind accept hayes midfielders security disappointment additional decorate home turnover field dip add future leader sport identity deep huan watch interim twila glare debut select pleased training plan collaborate contact find chemistry match half captain dirty wing earlier dug deflect include talk probably ready task post south tex play froze emma eighth china effort appoint frisco bending top enjoy corner disciple career cup tuesday lead international key national moultrie goal beat away london chelsea nighswonger spirit trinity world week day jenna side florida serena change bring extend dahlkemper rebound olympics direction opportunity united jersey foundation schedule tennis live monitor momentarily lift begin abby shaw liberate figure displayed october smith streak attack remain starter soccer grow return goalkeeper time approach tactic season list connection long assist role score midfield rise box slide olivia coach naomi february saturday paris make rodman accidental victory state,0.9964,0.0,6.749090909090906,0.3679359925788497,0,2023-12-02
Washington Post,Texas routs Oklahoma State to win Big 12 title ahead of SEC departure,2023-12-02 19:26:00,Glynn A. Hill,"Texas routed Oklahoma State in the Big 12 championship game Saturday, sending a firm message to the College Football Playoff selection committee and giving its fans a chance to send their own message to conference commissioner Brett Yormark.The 49-21 victory at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., ended a 13-year conference title drought for Texas, which will depart the Big 12 for the SEC next year. The Longhorns won the Big 12′s inaugural championship in 1996 and spent the past 27 years in the conference.The No. 7 team in the CFP rankings, Texas (12-1) is vying for a place in the playoff but needs favorable results in other conference championship games to have a chance.If Saturday’s win served as a statement to the selection committee, it doubled as a rebuke of Yormark for Texas fans, who seemed not to forget his comments this summer rooting against the Longhorns to a crowd of Texas Tech supporters. He was showered with boos and chants of “SEC! SEC!” during the trophy presentation.“It’s all good, it’s all good,” Yormark said through the jeers.“An incredible season by the Texas Longhorns. You guys with today’s dominating performance deserve a ticket to the CFP for sure.”Led by Ollie Gordon II, the nation’s leading rusher, No. 18 Oklahoma State (9-4) had won seven of its past eight games entering Saturday’s contest.The Cowboys eliminated rival Oklahoma, which will follow Texas to the SEC, from Big 12 title contention when they topped BYU in their regular season finale. They looked to deny the Longhorns in more direct fashion Saturday but surrendered touchdowns on their first four defensive possessions.Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers threw for 452 yards with four touchdowns, including one to 362-pound defensive tackle T’Vondre Sweat, who lined up as a tight end and struck the Heisman pose after reeling in a two-yard catch. Gordon, who came in averaging 137.1 yards, was limited to 34 yards on 13 carries.The championship capped a 2023 campaign that saw the Longhorns break through in Coach Steve Sarkisian’s third season at the school.Texas went 5-7 in 2021 and improved to 8-5 last season. After tallying double-digit win totals in nine consecutive seasons from 2001 to 2009, it had only achieved the feat once since, in 2018.The Longhorns depart the Big 12 with four conference championships, having won the previous three in 1996, 2005 and 2009.

Washington Post,Alabama beats Georgia to win SEC title and complicate playoff picture,2023-12-02 19:24:00,Jesse Dougherty,"ATLANTA — From his left, from his right and in front of his face, Jalen Milroe had defenders closing in, the pocket shrinking into a straitjacket. Alabama, the team on his 20-year-old shoulders, needed a first down in the fourth quarter of the SEC championship game Saturday to bury Georgia with a touchdown instead of giving it late life with a field goal.So Milroe hung in there. He scanned the field in Georgia territory at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. And while those defenders reached for him, he flipped a pass to Isaiah Bond, the ball landing softly in the wide receiver’s waiting hands. Three plays later, eighth-ranked Alabama scored that touchdown to extend its lead to 10, the padding it needed in a 27-24 win that snapped No. 1 Georgia’s 29-game winning streak.In the moment, it meant another conference title for the Crimson Tide and Nick Saban, who has won only 11 of them (nine in Tuscaloosa). But the promise of an Alabama win was always chaos for the College Football Playoff selection committee ahead of Sunday’s decision.Chaos activated, then.“The message that I would send [to the committee] is we won the SEC,” Saban said. “We beat the number one team in the country, which everybody on the committee thought was the number one in the country, and they won 29 straight games. So if we needed to do something to pass the eye test, I guess that probably contributed to it significantly.”Your turn, Kirby Smart.“[CFP executive director] Bill Hancock said it’s not the most deserving,” Georgia’s coach said. “He said, simply, it’s the best four teams. So you’re going to tell me somebody in that committee room doesn’t think that that Georgia team is not one of the best four teams, I don’t know if they are in the right profession.”Before Saturday, Georgia’s last loss was in December 2021, in this very building in this very game. Oh, it was also against Alabama, because who else? But that year, the Bulldogs still made the playoff and won their first of back-to-back national titles. A defeat in the SEC championship game wasn’t the end. In some ways, it was the beginning.This year, though, the path to another playoff berth for Georgia (12-1) is littered with Alabama (12-1), Texas (12-1) and undefeated teams. No. 3 Washington (13-0) beat No. 5 Oregon in the Pac-12 championship game Friday night. One-loss Texas, which won the Big 12 title Saturday, remains in the picture after edging Alabama in September. And Saturday night, as Atlanta turned into Tuscaloosa East, two more undefeated teams were set to kick off with conference titles on the line: No. 2 Michigan in the Big Ten championship game in Indianapolis and No. 4 Florida State in the ACC title game in Charlotte.After Michigan beat No. 16 Iowa and Florida State beat No. 14 Louisville to both improve to 13-0, the committee has some hard choices. Ditch an undefeated conference champion, probably Florida State, to clear space for two of Alabama, Texas and Georgia? Leave out Georgia? Georgia and Alabama in favor of three unbeaten conference champs and the team that beat Alabama head-to-head? Push aside Greg Sankey’s repeated pleas for the SEC, which by Saturday included multiple allusions to a lesson from Sesame Street? (“One of these things is not like the other.”)The SEC commissioner has a point. His conference is the best in the country. But the talent at the top of it — spread across Georgia and Alabama — meant that, at the very least, one blue blood would be cannibalized by the other Saturday. Georgia met the wrong end of that reality, putting its fate in someone else’s hands.When Alabama’s players were asked to stump for a playoff spot, linebacker Dallas Turner deferred to what they did on the field. Milroe took the offer.“No, I got something to say,” he said, leaning into his microphone. “Georgia is number one, right? You beat the number one team, what do they consider us?”When the game was over, when Milroe finished the Bulldogs with a 30-yard run, when Alabama closed the win with kneel-downs, the team ran toward its fans. Their chants and screams nearly drowned out the band, no matter how hard the musicians blew on their horns. That they could yell still, that their lungs could produce so much noise — let alone celebrate at Georgia’s expense — was a minor miracle in itself.In the hours before the gates opened, they cut through the fog, kept their legs moving, killed time in the shadows of a stadium that could cosplay as an airplane hangar. Maybe they visited the big tent selling Georgia gear (with a small sign out front saying Alabama shirts were available, too). Maybe they packed in behind the “College GameDay” set.Or maybe they just walked aimlessly, because all that nervous energy had to go somewhere.And when it was time, they flooded the concourse, the bright red and crimson bleeding into one another. If there were shirts without logos on them, they could have probably been counted with two hands. A pair of older men, both wearing Georgia onesies, slung plastic wrestling belts over their shoulders. A young woman squinted at a concessions stand, crinkled her nose, then reminded anyone in ear shot where they were.“A chicken sandwich?” she said, an Alabama sticker on her cheek. “If I’m going to eat a chicken sandwich, it’s going to be from Chick-fil-A.”Nevertheless, no matter how much the food and stress weighed them down, they all screamed for four hours straight, from when the special teamers jogged out for pregame warmups to when the clock showed zeros in the fourth. In between, Georgia cruised to a touchdown on its first drive, Alabama punched back with a 10-play, 92-yard touchdown drive to take a 10-7 lead early in the second, and the Crimson Tide then widened the gap with a score before the half, when Milroe fit three straight passes into tight windows, the third a 15-yard strike to Jermaine Burton.Burton, a transfer from Georgia, stared at his old sideline before disappearing in a crowd of teammates. His touchdown catch built a 17-7 lead before the break. On the other side of it, the gap slimmed to seven when Peyton Woodring knocked through a 34-yard field goal for the Bulldogs. But Alabama answered, turning a turnover — a fumble recovery deep in Georgia’s territory — into a chip-shot field goal for Will Reichard.That brought the game to the fourth quarter, to Alabama having 15 minutes to defend a 10-point lead and upend Georgia’s season. And after Bulldogs quarterback Carson Beck lunged in from a yard out, making it 20-17, Alabama had to hold on for 10 more minutes. That’s when Milroe rallied his offense, flipping that third-down pass to Bond, going right back to him for 11 more yards, then handing to Roydell Williams for a one-yard score.The last 10-point advantage was enough. It was safe in Milroe’s hands. But the playoff picture — a tidy one, at least — was certainly not.If this game happened a year from now, there would be 12 teams in the upcoming playoff instead of four. Saban and Smart probably wouldn’t have kicked off their news conferences with pleas. Alabama and Georgia would have played for seeding, not to fuel their biggest dreams.The end of something, of the tension and stakes that filled every last inch of Mercedes-Benz Stadium until the final whistle? Saban, kicked back, a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth, didn’t quite see it that way.“I think when we have 12 teams, you all will still make a case for 12 more,” he said to a room of reporters. “That’s kind of your job. Just like the basketball tournament. I mean, how many teams do they put in? Sixty-eight? And then you have a two-hour show on who else should have gotten in or who got in that shouldn’t have?",7668,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/02/alabama-georgia-football-sec-championship/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,miracle meant ditch chant unbeaten sell pass bury scream title selection instead airplane scan jogged noise improve lunge brought dallas repeat tidy closing gear fog job simply played ball yell hancock yard safe night executive hard pad tide building cruise tent leg test remains berth gap stand belt linebacker finish saban game sunday slung defer happen weigh tournament september concession set answer upend spot drive moment energy sandwich sideline contribute fourth minute fuel picture quarter send defender walk big promise champion flood sign hangar sankey washington woman rally disappear playoff push left player stadium food friday williams wait give eat lung small early nose carson fill shrink oregon teammate defend bulldog window available back straitjacket front matter bleeding guess cannibalize logo drown december put ahead isaiah undefeated teamers blue greg wear milroe country team defeat crowd star warmups ten tight kind count slimmed plastic microphone sec lesson packed special beck zero bright whistle conference fate message favor close open street transfer turnover loss field chaos iowa shoulder produce blew final territory onesies strike jermaine deep pregame talent allusion louisville move shadow land number roydell reality half line space smart tension snap kick expense hold concourse offense flip seed atlanta hand include band lean crinkle probably wrong choice pair blood nervous inch champ gameday play bond horn alabama championship cosplay indianapolis commissioner kill eye top corner hour bill red reach celebrate chicken break stake musician woodring college grin tug wrestling room gate straight news director lead widen stump deserve national nick pocket jalen clock goal reporter beat litter leave case path fit michigan receiver point shirt aimlessly side ear florida young activate life consider squint year texas extend football east upcoming win shot wide crimson sesame basketball fumble remind peyton run georgia cfp time cut committee advantage kirby season touchdown mouth recovery turn ran show stress score tuscaloosa acc catch hung late multiple spread punch quarterback edge coach sticker built visit plea saturday turner make minor cheek knock clear state softly,0.99145,0.0782472613458528,6.754879594423315,0.3943690840250473,0,2023-12-02

It is the first time Miami has won 11 games in a season since 2003, and it did so by frustrating a respected Toledo running game that was held to 97 yards on 29 attempts.""Our rush defense is pretty damn good,"" Miami coach Chuck Martin said in his postgame, on-field interview. ""It was a great challenge ... but our offense did just enough to get it done.""The Rockets (11-2) were attempting to become the first Toledo team to win 12 straight games for the first time since 1971.Following a 40-yard field goal by Nicholson at the start of the third quarter, Dequan Finn gave Toledo its only lead of the game with a 3-yard run. Nicholson put Toledo in front for good 16-14 at the beginning of the fourth quarter when he made another 40-yarder, and Amos sealed the win when he ran 10 yards for a touchdown with 2:41 left.Miami took a 10-0 lead on a 32-yard field goal by Nicholson and a 1-yard run by Amos. The scoring run was set up by a targeting call against Kiel Eldridge, who hit Smith on a third-and-13 play from the Toledo 16 with 1:25 seconds left in the first quarter.Toledo scored 9 seconds before halftime on Finn's 13-yard pass to Anthony Torres. The pair also connected on the 2-point conversion to pull the Rockets within two.""The rhythm of the game never got going,"" Toledo coach Jason Candle said.

And even though that may be off the table, and it’s not necessarily something that can be obtained anymore, it was still a goal, and I still worked for it every day. It’s disappointing to lose in a game like this. Obviously, for many reasons, but I just think going into the game, you don’t prepare for losing because that would be a loser's mentality.""So, when it does happen, it just kind of puts you in shock and you just kind of have to think about it. And kind of battle your feelings. Battle those negative thoughts. This is a time to where again, you get knocked back down, and things didn’t go the way you wanted them to. But that is life.

CNN,Lionel Messi says he is focused on playing at next year’s Copa América but doesn’t rule out appearing at 2026 World Cup,2023-12-02 13:19:00,Issy Ronald,"Lionel Messi is focused on playing at next June’s Copa América in the USA, though the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner hasn’t completely ruled out appearing for Argentina at the 2026 World Cup, he told an ESPN/Star+ documentary “Champions, A Year Later.”“As long as I feel good and I can continue to deliver, I’m going to (continue playing with Argentina). All I’m thinking about today is getting to the Copa América and being able to play in it,” he said.“Then time will tell whether I’ll be at the World Cup or not. I’m going to be at an age (39) that normally doesn’t allow me to play in the World Cup.“I will always try to compete to the maximum and I am the first to know when I can be at that level and when I can’t.”Messi inspired Argentina to World Cup glory in 2022 on his fifth attempt, winning the Golden Ball for the tournament’s best player along the way and scoring twice in the final against France.That victory, along with a 2021 Copa América trophy, came after international glory had eluded Argentina and Messi for years, as they lost three major finals in a row – the 2014 World Cup, 2015 Copa and 2016 Copa.“After suffering for so many years, now that we are experiencing a special moment that I have never experienced before, I want to enjoy it to the fullest,” Messi said.“I feel good within the group, which is very united, very strong. A group that enjoys being together. I want to take advantage of all that, without thinking two or three years ahead, which in football is a lot.”Since winning the World Cup in Qatar, Messi has moved across the Atlantic, joining MLS club Inter Miami and prompting a new wave of American interest in soccer.He added that he is “aware” he went “to a smaller league” when he joined the MLS but said “it’s very much a personal thing and the way you deal with it and compete.”Following Messi’s arrival in July, Inter Miami embarked on a club-record 12-game unbeaten run and won its first ever trophy, the Leagues Cup, but ended the campaign without a win in seven games, with Messi missing for some of that time through injury.“Maybe we’ll do well in the Copa América and everything will work out for me to continue. Maybe not. It’s hard,” Messi said.“Being world champion changed me in the peace of mind knowing that, in my job, I could achieve everything.”",2309,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/sport/lionel-messi-future-argentina-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231202112633-lionel-messi-world-cup-2022-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lionel suffer mind ballon unbeaten usa argentina documentary advantage full hard peace group campaign row feel change june wave club copa interest enjoys glory attempt win july ahead american prompt strong focus miami moment miss continue year rule tournament major move inspire final inter deliver add international maximum special winner score aware deal small golden job personal completely messi long elude experience qatar américa run play lose league player today arrival champion embark game ball trophy compete enjoy follow time age ml victory join united world cup told atlantic work level football experienced achieve,0.9903,0.1299263750541359,5.599999999999998,0.426140627049718,0,2023-12-02
CNN,Tiger Woods improves on day two of his long-awaited return to golf,2023-12-02 06:40:00,David Close,"Tiger Woods had a much improved second round at the Hero World Challenge on Friday, shooting a two-under-par 70 as he continued on his golfing comeback.Woods, making his highly anticipated return to golf after a lengthy layoff, got off to a brilliant start on day two and looked to be flying up the leaderboard.The 47-year-old opened the front nine holes with four birdies to move to four-under-par for the tournament.However, like the first round, Woods stumbled towards the back end of his 18 with three bogeys before closing it out with a birdie on the final hole.The 15-time major winner ended the day on one-over par after his second round and in 15th on the leaderboard.“Better than yesterday for sure,” Woods said after his improved showing on day two. “Overall, the round was better for sure. The start was better, the middle part of the round was better.“I missed a couple putts there towards the end, I thought would’ve kept the round going and unfortunately it kind of stalled out a little bit but surely it was better than it was yesterday.”However, Woods admitted his golf game isn’t exactly where he’d like it to be after spending so much time away from the course since undergoing ankle surgery in April.“I haven’t played in six months so things are not as sharp as they normally would be,” Woods added. “There’s some good in there and just got to make sure that the good is more consistent than it has been.”Woods tees off at 11:43 a.m. ET on day three and will be playing alongside talented Norwegian Viktor Hovland.Scottie Scheffler and Jordan Spieth currently sit atop the leaderboard on nine-under-par.",1622,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/sport/tiger-woods-day-two-golf-return-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210602152422-david-close2.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,middle anticipate norwegian round course sharp tiger scheffler tee consistent return away highly closing golfing wood back front make lengthy admit challenge miss improve major spending move kind ankle final shoot alongside add stall stumble putt surely undergo birdie continued winner brilliant surgery unfortunately fly currently atop talented bogey played hole layoff day hero play month jordan show start bit game leaderboard time yesterday viktor world spieth open part couple golf friday,0.9826,0.0,8.604402515723265,0.4732222222222222,0,2023-12-02
Chicago Tribune,Byron’s small-town high school football team faced waves of off-field adversity on the way to becoming historic state champions,2023-12-02 05:00:00,Robert McCoppin,"Five-year-old Ryker Hoppe was watching the rural Byron High School football team at a game this fall when he had trouble with his eyes, which began to misalign. His family took him to an emergency room, which led to a shocking diagnosis: Ryker had inoperable brain cancer.A few weeks later, after hearing the news, the team took a bus to Ryker’s house, where players and cheerleaders got out to cheer on the 5-year-old and give him fist bumps.“I made sure to give him a high-five,” player Carsen Behn said. “I just wanted to make that night very special for him. He was in our thoughts the whole way.”In one game of passing a collection bucket and selling T-shirts, the crowd gathered $12,000 for the boy’s family. A GoFundMe raised more than $100,000 in a week. The team ran out to its remaining home games with a flag that read, “Rally for Ryker,” and the players wore the boy’s initials on their helmets.They would go on to an undefeated season, set an Illinois high school record for points in a season and win the state 3A championship.Their support for Ryker was a reflection of the treatment the players themselves had received from the community through a series of tragedies. No fewer than nine students, seven of them football players, lost parents during their time in school. The deaths were unrelated and generally due to natural causes such as heart attacks, strokes and cancer, but those parents generally had been in their 50s or younger.Byron is a small town, just southwest of Rockford, with a population of about 3,600. Its high school has fewer than 500 students, but receives significant funding from the local nuclear power plant, which was recently saved by a state bailout. Residents say many folks know each other, and when hard times come, they are quick to help one another.“It’s always been a tight community, like most small towns,” Cornerstone Family Church Pastor Randy Snyder said. “Because the team feels like family, it’s more personal. Anytime you go through a tragedy, having people who love and care for you makes a difference.”The football team is a source of pride for the town, having won championships in 1999 and 2021. Its star running back is the son of a former NFL player. Its star quarterback transferred from another school. Top players took positions on both offense and defense, and the team won lopsided victories throughout the season.Coaches credit the players’ focus and work ethic. After they lost in the playoffs last year, the players went right back to training. They hit the weight room regularly at 5 a.m. to get bigger and stronger, and ran acceleration drills to get faster. They’ve played football together since grade school.The goal from the start of the season was to win another state title. The team stresses unity, meeting outside of town in a barn, and having dinner together once a week from local restaurants. After each victory, players tie symbolic shoelaces together and nail another rung onto a 14-step ladder marking each step of the way.But the team has been tested repeatedly off the field by tragedy. Each time a student’s parent has fallen ill, neighbors have rallied to show their support, help with child care and form meal trains to deliver dinners to the families.Among the parents lost was Matt Henkel, manager of the local golf course, who died of brain cancer in 2021 at age 42. His 13-year battle included multiple surgeries, radiation, chemotherapy, headaches, infection and exhaustion, with the cancer disappearing at one point, only to return. But he died with his family by his side.Residents helped the family with meals, support and child care for their two daughters and a son, Ashton, who plays on the football team. Matt’s wife Cammie Henkel wrote a message to the community.“Life may not look like what we planned, but life can still be good,” she wrote. “What happened to Matt and our family has unlocked empathy I would never know, it magnified my gratitude and reminds me daily of the magic in every moment.”“The important thing to remember is through the tragedy life can still be good,” Cammie Henkel added. “Our chapter was hard but boy did we learn about how good the world can be.”Ashton, now a senior, said he and his teammates treasure the memories of the parents they lost.“I feel like we all gained lessons from our parents,” Ashton said. “Every day after work, my father would take me to the baseball or football fields and spend time with me trying to perfect my craft. Even if I had a bad game, he knew it was a part of being an athlete, and he helped me with my confidence.”After he graduates, Ashton plans to either go to college or possibly work as a lineman for the biggest local employer, ComEd.He credits the team’s success to heart.“Every person cared,” he said. “We wanted to do it for each other, and we wanted to go out with a bang.”When Megahn Behn passed away in 2022 at the age of 37, she left a son, Carsen, who has dealt with her loss through playing football, hunting and fishing with his friends.“They’ve all come together as a brotherhood and supported each other,” his grandmother, Kris Hagemann, said. “If one boy is down, another one brings him up. If somebody else scores, they’re just happy for each other all the time.”The school has also faced controversy around the team. In 2019, a former player filed suit against the school, its coaches, administrators and one player, alleging a culture of bullying and hazing. The complaint alleged players were forced to run naked and that one player sexually abused another on the team bus. The case is pending in court.For those who remain believers in the team, it’s been a place of victory through a time of loss. Some of the players are still grieving, but they have each other to get them through it, coach Jeff Boyer said.“No high school kid should have to deal with that,” Boyer said “These kids found a way to get through difficult times and excel at everything they do, in the classroom and on the football field. What I’m most proud of is what great kids they are.”Meanwhile, 5-year-old Ryker continues to get radiation to treat his tumor. Ryker’s aunt, Jennifer Smith, can’t thank the team or the community enough.“There aren’t enough words to truly express our gratitude for everyone’s generous donations to our family,” she wrote on the boy’s GoFundMe page. “Thank you all for your kindness and compassion as we continue this fight.”rmccoppin@chicagotribune.com",6453,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-byron-hs-football-adversity-20231202-bdtqx2qzejdvvld6cbr6c4xoby-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/lDE806teMy0dmZqPMus56uMu7jE=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/LAKOLTGX5ZGYDLOJMOOWLOKELY.jpg,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,controversy smith knew read reflection offense student faster rung happy course big room empathy ethic population bailout feel meeting goal return grandmother complaint rockford ran daughter bullying tight gratitude donation top believer transfer barn back hit brings make focus lead power bus receives neighbor sell folk kid headache generally save tie difficult defense quarterback high deliver gather tumor henkel graduate baseball force stress special left senior success give funding treatment cheerleader small radiation boyer dinner carsen shock plan initial series point megahn week lopsided grieve kindness boy diagnosis express hagemann set life run school day abuse person record training nfl kris player learn start grade begin remain unlocked season happen fist parent mark heart generous rally eye cornerstone train time proud step treat plant news test world hearing work symbolic lesson attack football pastor community remember part randy possibly found father regularly meal treasure rural star ashton brotherhood resident death fishing suit chemotherapy shoelace word championship passing allege college local field state hoppe misalign wore recently drill jeff disappear hard compassion acceleration pride sexually inoperable cheer chapter away place perfect administrator repeatedly athlete crowd exhaustion hunt aunt win memory write anytime home haze spend jennifer strong receive dealt message family gofundme continue raise bucket ladder year cammie tragedy ryker manager wife naked credit natural multiple form team collection page snyder add love watch case culture score pass brain significant deal surgery magic flag night fall illinois personal teammate support playoff cancer nuclear coach craft matt played battle nail great behn town church excel lineman source play position lose pending magnify unrelated show rmccoppin reminds byron southwest game infection age employer classroom victory emergency loss stroke weight quick unity house include important undefeated trouble title due former golf daily child file restaurant,0.98515,0.1394700139470013,7.148947766843296,0.4358516860368713,0,2023-12-02
Washington Post,"Washington beats Oregon in stirring Pac-12 finale, sharpening playoff picture",2023-12-02 00:56:00,Chuck Culpepper,"LAS VEGAS — As two fan bases thundered and season-long fates teetered through a goose-bump Friday night near The Strip, they played a Pac-12 football championship so hypnotic that it almost grew possible to forget the conference’s impending death and the winner’s impending playoff posture. It seemed almost as if a dazzling collection of athletes got done making plays back and forth and then looked up and said, Where do we stand?Here’s where they stood after No. 3 Washington led and then withstood No. 5 Oregon, 34-31: Pac-12 football ended up worth mourning as the league disintegrates in realignment, and the College Football Playoff had its first ironclad qualifier. That would be the Huskies (13-0), whose second three-point win over Oregon (11-2) this season means they’ll join the final foursome for the program’s second time, become the first Pac-12 entry in the four-team playoff since the Washington team of 2016, stand as the first unbeaten Pac-12 team in the playoff era and never forget the night the confetti rained purple indoors.“Wow,” second-year Coach Kalen DeBoer began, soon summarizing, “We did it at home. We did it on the road. We did it in wind. We did it in rain.” They did it foremost with pivotal plays at urgent moments in serial games, such that DeBoer cited “a deep, deep, deep belief in our football team right now that when the moments get tough, we can really home in, guys will do their job and not get overwhelmed.”For this final episode of a season sparkling with purple, they did it in their league’s last football game, before 61,195 in the Las Vegas Raiders’ Allegiant Stadium, in a show of two quarterbacks who have spent the autumn with their names frequenting Heisman Trophy discussions. Both excelled in general Friday night, with Washington’s Michael Penix Jr. steering the Huskies to a 20-3 lead by the second quarter and Oregon’s Bo Nix guiding the Ducks to a 24-20 lead by the third. Yet as the sixth-year transfer Penix finished 27-for-39 passingfor 319 yards with two important little first-down rushes, and the fifth-year transfer Nix finished 21-for-34 passing for 239 yards and one mighty rush, Washington did it with two Penix-led drives in particular, two drives to last a lifetime.The first, straddling the third and fourth quarters, covered 75 yards in 10 plays, ended with Dillon Johnson’s hard running that helped him accumulate 152 rushing yards against the nation’s No. 8 rushing defense — “I could have lost my leg, my arm, my forehead, my feet and I still would have been out there,” he said — provided a 27-24 lead and ended with 9:04 left.Then a crucial third-down stop from Washington defensive end Bralen Trice on a Nix run that looked promising at its outset led to the second drive, a marvel covering 82 yards in 12 plays of the steady and the spectacular, ended with Penix’s third-down flip to tight end Quentin Moore for a two-yard touchdown and Moore’s only catch, took a crucial 6:20, ended with 2:44 left, provided a 34-24 lead and upheld Penix’s instructions to teammates between quarters: “Just look at the guy next to you,"" Penix recollected saying, ""and just trust that he’s going to do his job to win this game.”Still, this game would not let go so easily, and Oregon needed only 25 seconds to narrow it to 34-31 on Traeshon Holden’s stirring 63-yard catch-and-run from Nix, which included the last 45 yards of Holden weaving up the right side of the field. Then, with one last, clinching third-down, six-yard Penix pass to the sideline to Jalen McMillan, who finished with nine receptions for 131 yards, a “shocking end” arrived, Nix said, calling it “one of those things where you want the moment to last longer than what it can.”“All right,” second-year Oregon Coach Dan Lanning began, “this one hurts.”Nix and Lanning and their Ducks reached Las Vegas as the team with the greater hipness, their romp through the schedule since a 36-33 loss to Washington on Oct. 14 pleasing football eyes across the nation, their average win 42-16 in their previous six games. Las Vegas oddsmakers favored them by nine or 10, perhaps a gift to a 12-0 team with technically the higher ranking. The Huskies quickly behaved as if miffed, sharply holding the ball for the first 7:26, hurrying toward that 20-3 lead and a 255-142 advantage in first-half yardage.Yet the game tightened as such games do, as Oregon wrapped three touchdowns around halftime, one before and two afterward, their offense again unstoppable with Nix throwing and even taking off on a 44-yard scramble. The noise in the stadium doubled. Nix threw two yards to Terrance Ferguson for a touchdown on one hairy third-down play, and two yards again to Ferguson for a touchdown on one hairy fourth-down play, and the game started whirling toward who-knows-where.Well, Washington specializes in such junctures, to the point that Nix said, “They battled in a lot of games down the stretch” — 15-7 against Arizona State, 52-42 against Southern California, 35-28 against Utah, 22-20 against Oregon State, 24-21 against Washington State — “and they pulled them all out.” Their latest case of that left Nix saying, “Man, you wish it could change. You wish you could go back and do so many different things.”After so many plays, and so much Washington advantage — 78-54 in offensive plays, 37:08-22:52 in time of possession, 10-for-15 to 3-for-10 in third-down conversions, 481-363 in total yards, 78-17 in fourth-quarter rushing yards — some ultimate winners took the ultimate victory podium, the last of this vivid conference in one of its stoutest seasons. Penix got his MVP award, and his teammates got their chant, “Michael! Michael! Michael!”The quarterback who had dipped ever so slightly across recent weeks had resurfaced ever so impressively just before the credits rolled. He had filled the ending with wowing passes such as the 31-yarder to McMillan toward the first fourth-quarter touchdown, and the 25-yarder and 19-yarder to Ja’Lynn Polk along the way to the second. He earned his congratulations from Nix, and he fulfilled what DeBoer said of him: “He’s got all these experiences to draw upon and knows when to take the risk and when not to.""

Fox News,Knicks star Mitchell Robinson moves in former high school basketball coach after wife’s death,2023-12-01 23:46:00,Chantz Martin,"New York Knicks center Mitchell Robinson did not have much of an impact on the basketball court during the first couple of years of his high school career. It wasn't until Robinson transferred to Chalmette High School in Louisiana that he began to showcase his talent.Butch Stockton was Robison's coach at Chalmette, and it appears the pair have maintained a friendship over the years. On Thursday, Robison learned that Stockton's wife, Dawn, died in September after 31 years of marriage.Robinson then decided to make a heartwarming gesture. He invited his former coach to move in with him in New York, so he would not have to be alone as he grieved.Mitchell Robinson, #23 of the New York Knicks, in action against the New Orleans Pelicans at Madison Square Garden on February 25, 2023, in New York City.

You come to New York with me and enjoy yourself,'"" Stockton told MSG Network. ""Get your mind back straight, because you know how much you loved your wife. I loved your wife.""NBA IN-SEASON TOURNAMENT 'MET ITS INTENDED PURPOSE,' KNICKS HEAD COACH TOM THIBODEAU SAYSRobinson and Stockton bond by watching movies, and the former high school basketball coach even watches the NBA star's dogs when he is away.Robinson expressed gratitude for Stockton's guidance when he was in high school and said he was more than happy to help during his old coach's time of need.According to his bio published on the Chalmette High School's website, Stockton's coaching career spanned more than four decades. He is also a member of the St. Bernard Sports Hall of Fame.""He's a great guy, he helped me get to where I'm at,"" Robinson said Thursday. "" . . . So it works out for the best.

Washington Post,Kevin Durant moves into top 10 on NBA’s all-time scoring list,2023-12-01 23:22:00,Ben Golliver,"Kevin Durant took a pass on the right wing, drove hard to the baseline and banked in a running layup to enter the top 10 on the NBA’s all-time scoring list Friday as the Phoenix Suns star surpassed Hall of Fame center Moses Malone’s 27,409 points.The 35-year-old forward, who has played 1,003 games in his 16-year career, entered Friday’s game against the Denver Nuggets at the Footprint Center in Phoenix needing 17 points to move past Malone. Durant wasted little time with star teammates Devin Booker and Bradley Beal sidelined by injuries, scoring 12 points in the first quarter and making a pull-up jumper late in the second quarter to tie Malone. The 13-time all-star then reached 27,411 points with his layup less than a minute before halftime.Though Durant finished with 30 points, four rebounds and 11 assists, he shot 0 for 10 in the second half and Denver claimed a 119-111 road win. Nikola Jokic led the Nuggets with 21 points, five rebounds and 16 assists.“It’s cool,"" Durant said. “It’s a long journey to be up there to be mentioned with the greats. It takes a lot of work, it takes a lot of preparation and a lot of people to help you get to that point. I’m grateful and thinking about the people who helped me get to this point: all my teammates, coaches, family, and friends that invested [in] me since I was a kid. All of this stuff is cool to do and shows you I’m getting old in this league, as well. It’s amazing to be among the greats. ... I’ve been hearing about [the milestone] all day. I heard it [announced] in the arena as soon as it happened. I’m just grateful to still be playing the game I love.""Durant ranks second among active players in total points behind Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, who became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer last season. James saluted Durant’s milestone on social media.Though Durant’s run up the scoring ladder has been slowed by his 2019 Achilles’ tear and subsequent injuries, he has nevertheless remained one of the most prolific and consistent scorers in league history. Entering the 2023-24 season, Durant had averaged at least 25.0 points in 14 straight seasons, an accomplishment topped only by James’s 19 such seasons. He has also registered two 50-40-90 shooting seasons (50 percent on field goals, 40 percent from three-point range and 90 percent from the free throw line), joining Steve Nash (four) and Larry Bird (two) as the only players to do so multiple times.After a prolific one-and-done season at the University of Texas, Durant was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics with the second pick in the 2007 draft. Though he endured a somewhat rocky 2007-08 rookie of the year campaign as a teenager, Durant emerged as one of the NBA’s top scorers as soon as the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and rebranded as the Thunder in 2008. He proceeded to claim four scoring titles across a five-year span with the Thunder while leading the NBA in total points every season from 2009-10 to 2013-14. Durant, who became the second-youngest player (after James) to reach 10,000 career points at age 24 in 2012, averaged a career-high 32.0 points to win 2014 MVP honors.A foot injury during the 2014-15 season and a 2016 move to the Golden State Warriors slowed Durant’s scoring pace somewhat, though he won two championships and two Finals MVPs during his three-year stint in the Bay Area.The Achilles’ tear, which occurred during the 2019 Finals, probably cost Durant his shot at catching James as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer. After missing the entire 2019-20 season to rehabilitate the injury, Durant has averaged only 46 games played over his past three full seasons because of various injuries. In the 12 seasons before his Achilles’ injury, Durant averaged 1,912 points per season. In his three full seasons since the injury, he slipped to 1,317 points per season.When healthy, though, he has remained one of the league’s most effective all-around scorers, ranking second at 31.3 points per game this season. Durant’s career scoring average of 27.3 points trails only Michael Jordan (30.1) and Wilt Chamberlain (30.1) among players with at least 1,000 games played.“What a unique talent,” Nuggets Coach Michael Malone said during his pregame news conference. “When you look at the size, the length, the skill, the shooting and just the ability to get his own shot — [being able to] raise up and shoot over you whenever he wants has always stood out. The one thing that I admire about him: He’s done it his own way. He hasn’t tried to be anybody other than Kevin Durant and I think there’s a lot to be said for that. When young players come in the league, everybody wants to say that he’s the ‘Next [Somebody].’ Kevin Durant was never the next anybody. He was the first Kevin Durant and you have to respect that about him.”Malone entered the NBA in 1976 after playing two seasons in the ABA. A three-time MVP and 13-time all-star who won a title with the 1983 Philadelphia 76ers, Malone retired in 1995 with a 20.6 career scoring average in 1,329 games over 19 NBA seasons. The NBA does not count Malone’s 2,171 points in the ABA in its record books, leaving his career tally at 27,409 rather than 29,580.“I try to get to know the players from the past,” Durant said. ""YouTube has been such a valuable asset to people. You can always go back and relive those moments. As basketball players, I think it’s our job to go back and know the history of the game and know who paved the way for us to be who we are today. I always respected Moses as somebody who doesn’t get the credit he deserves being a dominant, dominant player in this league for a while and a champion. He was the best player in the league at some point but doesn’t have that narrative around him or the hoopla around him as a player. I’m grateful to be in the same conversation with him.”Durant has a chance to make significant progress up the NBA’s scoring list before his contract expires after the 2025-26 season. This season, he could catch Carmelo Anthony (28,289) for ninth and Shaquille O’Neal (28,596) for eighth.With good health, Durant could then pass Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) for seventh and Dirk Nowitzki (31,560) for sixth by the end of the 2024-25 season. If Durant can average 27 points and play an average of 61 games per season through the end of his contract, he could surpass Jordan (32,292) to move into the top five by the end of the 2025-26 season.As with the ageless James, Durant has remained a top-10 player in the league deep into his 30s and benefited from the modern NBA’s pace-and-space style, which has led to an offensive boom. If he can maintain something close to his current scoring and availability rates, Durant could move past Kobe Bryant (33,643) for fourth if he signed another contract following the 2025-26 season, but challenging Karl Malone (36,928) for third could require Durant to keep playing well after his 40th birthday.",6922,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/01/kevin-durant-top-10-all-time-scoring/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain make anthony championship ageless seattle challenge injury back admire sixth chance nba past league probably consistent significant chamberlain claimed active emerge progress sideline throw pace length slow wilt fourth announce news jokic offensive assist love michael lakers endure shoot modern social fame friend field rehabilitate bryant job forward nikola expires footprint journey star dirk register young total rebranded lot pick proceed occur narrative player sign salute retire title accomplishment nash seventh deserves tally beal relocate run warrior center preparation finish current pregame hall miss stint mvp kid city university valuable texas carmelo lebron champion jordan sun leave raise topped minute full bird healthy ninth larry subsequent ability teammate angeles rebound bay style nugget move win catch history quarter average jumper reach conference scorer drove availability phoenix dominant day score great conversation span steve straight book denver arena half lead line wing free pave shaquille time moses range kobe surpass happen teenager career birthday goal youtube show boom stood draft baseline skill health oklahoma work credit deep size effective philadelphia enter heard age maintain prolific kevin booker nowitzki late layup invest year hard long top follow today basketball require hoopla season achilles aba supersonics mention benefit record game coach campaign bank hearing join stuff rank final karl rate relive rocky state grateful respect unique talent played close waste shot multiple foot slip entire amaze cost contract count asset percent road select neal milestone cool claim list golden bradley point james trail family rookie play devin friday moment ladder tie tear thunder,0.99605,0.1733603004911875,7.186364922206504,0.4138248847926266,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,"Wizards show spark, but can’t keep it lit in another loss at Orlando",2023-12-01 22:49:00,Ava Wallace,"Landry Shamet cocked the ball behind him, lurched his body backward for a step-back three-pointer, then fell into his teammates on the bench as the ball dropped through the net for the first of three quick conversions from deep to start the fourth quarter.Quick-footed and ferocious, the veteran guard provided exactly the type of charge the Washington Wizards needed late to push them across the finish line against the flourishing Magic.The problem? There was only one of him.The Wizards gave the Magic their best shot Friday in Orlando but came away with a 130-125 loss to a more physical, more polished team that closed a tight game with panache. Shamet had 11 points in the fourth quarter, and the Wizards shot 50 percent from the field, but the Magic was more productive. Moritz Wagner had 12 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter and little brother Franz Wagner had 13 of his game-high 31 in the final frame as Orlando worked Washington’s weak defense for the second game in a row to shoot 60.9 percent from the field over the final 12 minutes.The Magic scored 60 points in the paint just two nights after lighting up the Wizards for 66.With the win, the Magic (14-5) extended the NBA’s longest current winning streak to nine games and tied a franchise record. And Washington leaves Orlando with two losses and a heap of frustration.Friday’s game offered many promising moments for the Wizards (3-16) nestled amid the generally poor defense and 14 turnovers. Kyle Kuzma set an assertive tone from the start and led seven scorers in double figures with 27 points. Corey Kispert (15 points) and Shamet (13 points) got hot from the three-point line and showed poise and leadership as crucial role players off the bench.But for as hard as Washington played, it was beaten repeatedly on backdoor cuts and was a step behind Orlando’s zippy offense. The Magic wasn’t hiding its game plan — the Wizards either got lost on defense or couldn’t get between their marks and the basket quickly enough.Orlando’s pair of bruising 6-foot-10 big men did the most damage: Franz Wagner was a handful for the second game in a row and Paolo Banchero added 28 points and 13 rebounds.“That second half in general, some of the offensive rebounding, volume three-pointers in the third quarter, that hurt us a little bit, allowed them to set their defense,” Coach Wes Unseld Jr. said before adding that seven turnovers in the third quarter knocked the Wizards off-kilter. “But in general, I thought the effort, the overall intent was better tonight. The defensive disposition was much better. So you come up short, but I thought that was somewhat of a bounce-back for us.”Friday’s first half was certainly an improvement over Wednesday’s loss.The Wizards started strong, playing high-energy basketball behind Kuzma’s aggressive 12 points in 10 minutes in the first quarter. Shots were falling — they opened the game 10 for 15 from the field — but they were also baiting Orlando into fouls, got a handful of key three-pointers from Kispert and Tyus Jones and were communicating, for the most part, on defense.",3090,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/01/wizards-magic-wagner-brothers/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,amid quarter zippy intent extend assertive pair kispert scorer cocked heap key score polished nba hot poise orlando quick charge crucial away physical team basket volume defensive productive corey figure half lead line landry nestle fourth beaten repeatedly leaf hurt guard wizard offensive set backdoor damage unseld lurch franchise streak show push turnover flourish veteran shoot double paolo work field deep wednesday disposition mark brother open strong ferocious body wes jones effort offense late hard long baiting banchero give general poor handful step bit basketball drop kuzma problem add plan conversion communicate player bench frame record shamet type game kyle cut ball row coach weak lose final defense backward night role finish panache current close played tone shot short knock fall part tight provide tonight fell washington paint percent magic promising aggressive light foul loss quickly point moritz bruising minute franz net offer hiding generally teammate play tyus rebound friday moment start improvement tie win leadership big wagner,-0.8081,0.0,9.138680203045684,0.4533816425120773,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,"Maryland stumbles again on the road, drops Big Ten opener to Indiana",2023-12-01 22:25:00,Gene Wang,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — The road continues to be most unwelcoming for the Maryland men’s basketball team, which fell behind by double figures early in the first half and was unable to gain much traction thereafter in a 65-53 loss to Indiana in the Big Ten opener for both schools.The Terrapins (4-4), who had won three straight, dropped to 1-10 in conference games on the road dating from 2022-23, the first season under Coach Kevin Willard. They also have lost both true road games this season to Power Five opponents by an average of 14.5 points.Among the unsightly statistics for the Terrapins at Assembly Hall: 35.7 percent shooting overall and just 12.5 percent from deep (2 for 16). The Terrapins began the week as the second-worst three-point shooting team in the country. Indiana (6-1) shot 45.6 percent from the field and never trailed.“I feel like it’s physical and mental toughness as a unit,” point guard Jahmir Young said of the Terrapins’ road woes. “Individually, it’s there for some of us, but then some of us as a unit, it’s not coming together. So I’m not sure if it’s a lack of urgency. I’m not sure really what’s going on, but we have to turn that around quick.”Young scored a game-high 20 points but missed six of his seven three-point attempts, one game after making four of seven in Tuesday’s home rout of Rider. Julian Reese added 14 points and eight rebounds and was the only other Maryland player to score in double figures.The Hoosiers placed four players in double figures. Center Kel’el Ware, a 7-foot transfer from Oregon, led the charge with 18 points and 14 rebounds as part of Indiana’s overwhelming performance inside that produced a 40-26 advantage in points in the paint and a 46-30 margin on the boards.The closest Maryland came in the second half was within 10 points in the opening minutes on Young’s jumper. The deficit swelled to as much as 58-35 with 11:24 remaining, and the Terrapins provided little resistance the rest of the way.The lethargy that plagued Maryland in the first half extended into the first few minutes following halftime when the Hoosiers pushed the lead to 46-31 with 16:27 left on the heels of a 6-1 run that forced Willard to call a timeout. Maryland, however, failed to gather itself during the stoppage, instead permitting the Hoosiers to grow the margin to 51-31 with 14:57 to go.“Just get back to work on Sunday,” Willard said. “Day off [Saturday], get back to work on Sunday. Again, this is our second true road game. This is a much better environment than the last one we played at [in a 57-40 loss to Villanova at Finneran Pavilion on Nov. 17].”This time the first half ended with the Terrapins down 40-28 amid breakdowns at both ends of the court. Maryland trailed by double digits for the first time with 13:51 to play and never got closer than seven points during a disjointed first half in which it missed five layups and committed seven turnovers after notching a season-low six Tuesday.Underscoring the shooting travails for the Terrapins was Donta Scott (two points, 1 for 8 from the field) missing an uncontested layup in the closing minutes of the first half. Not long after the wayward shot, Indiana reeled off eight straight points for a 39-24 lead, its largest of the half, prompting Willard to call a timeout, his second to that point.He used his first just 3½ minutes into the game with the Terrapins, apart from Young, misfiring and playing tentatively while failing to counter Indiana’s energy that had the crowd standing for much of the game.The first Big Ten opener between Maryland and Indiana also featured the return of Jordan Geronimo to Assembly Hall after he spent the previous three seasons with the Hoosiers, playing in 82 games primarily as a reserve. Last season the 6-foot-6 forward started six games, the most in his career.The senior’s first game back at the storied arena since Feb. 18 was his sixth start for Maryland.The Bloomington homecoming, however, was forgettable, with Geronimo missing all five of his field goal attempts, committing three turnovers and airballing a free throw attempt in the closing minutes. He also drew a large portion of the defensive assignment on Ware, who proved a mismatch against any Maryland player guarding him.",4248,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/01/maryland-men-indiana-basketball/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain make urgency hoosier extend begin halftime finneran closest back country sixth crowd tuesday spent left reese stoppage physical team defensive jahmir figure throw travail storied rout plague timeout pavilion misfire guard unwelcoming drew push rest shoot grow prove field forward produce opener deficit young environment week kel primarily add geronimo player reel place lose run wayward unit center gather villanova hall miss feature performance permit provide forgettable fell attempt jordan continue minute fail oregon feel counter rebound ten big amid maryland saturday energy average jumper court stand power instead conference mismatch mental home bloomington day score closer disjoint closing overwhelm charge straight prompt arena half terrapin lead toughness unsightly heel free previous time willard resistance goal assignment statistic advantage turnover force digit double rider notch work deep lethargy sunday portion breakdown inside airballing kevin individually early call layup opening opponent tentatively long senior follow lack basketball date traction drop indiana season woe margin game coach large commit scott ware julian assembly unable played shot part return transfer donta swell paint percent road homecoming loss point trail uncontested turn play start reserve,-0.8605499999999999,0.1412429378531073,8.400144057623049,0.2946638655462184,0,2023-12-01

Washington Post,Moore administration targets $2 billion cut to Md. transportation projects,2023-12-01 19:19:00,"Ian Duncan, Erin Cox","The administration of Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is proposing to tackle a multibillion-dollar, long-term budget shortfall by imposing drastic cuts on transportation spending that would slow highway construction, reduce transit service and increase the cost of airport parking, according to a summary of the plans.The six-year plan, expected to be announced next week, calls for an 8 percent cut in the annual budgets of the state’s highway, transit, ports and airports agencies, along with the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA). Construction budgets at most of the agencies would face even deeper cuts, according to the summary, parts of which were obtained by The Washington Post.Maryland faces an across-the-board budget crunch caused by lackluster economic conditions and the expense of key policy goals. But the outlook is worse for transportation projects scheduled to begin in several years, partly because of rising construction costs and declining revenue streams dedicated to paying for them.The biggest proposed cut is a $1.6 billion hit over six years to highway construction that would “defund all major expansion construction projects” not advertised by Jan. 1 and cut by 30 percent the budget for maintenance projects designed to keep roads and bridges in good condition. Transit construction faces a $652 million cut that similarly targets expansion projects.Projects underway or set to begin next year did not appear to be affected, according to the documents reviewed by The Post.The administration has proposed saving money in the short term by reducing transportation-related services, such as having less litter pickup and mowing along state highways.The Maryland Department of Transportation said the proposal reflects the need for the state to both tighten its belt and invest in the future at a time of inflation.“The Moore-[Aruna] Miller Administration has been clear about the challenging budget shortfalls facing Maryland that have long been forecasted to take place,” MDOT said in a statement. “The depths of those structural problems only became clearer over time.”The General Assembly could revise the proposal when it meets in the new year.The plan follows MDOT’s announcement in September of a $2.1 billion shortfall in its six-year construction budget, with revenue forecast to lag spending despite federal funds from the $1 trillion infrastructure law. A recent report by legislative analysts put the shortfall at $2.8 billion.The gap is a reflection of a troubled budget picture that has threatened to imperil the ambitious agenda of Moore, a Democrat finishing his first year in office. The state’s economy hasn’t kept pace with that of several other states. Maryland boasts the country’s lowest unemployment rate, but economists say that figure is fueled partly by jobseekers moving to other states.Moore warned state and local leaders in August that budget cuts might be on the way because “our economic engine does not support our ambition.”A landmark education program designed to equalize and boost achievement, for example, is projected to cost roughly $4 billion annually when fully implemented. By fiscal 2028, however, the state will be at least $1.8 billion short each year, according to recent legislative estimates.Moore promised systemic change that would “leave no one behind,” pledging to end child poverty, expand economic opportunity and rebuild what he described as a hollowed-out state government. Next month, he’ll present a budget he says attempts to do that.Maryland budgets transportation spending separately from the rest of state government and on a six-year horizon, which is why the proposed transportation cuts are being announced separately.Aside from transportation, legislative analysts estimate that Moore also will have a roughly $400 million annual budget hole to close, amounting to about 1.3 percent of other scheduled state spending.Transportation construction has been especially hard-hit by inflation across the country, a factor that Maryland officials have said is partly responsible for the budget hole. At the same time, states are grappling with how to raise money from a growing number of electric vehicle drivers, who don’t pay the gas taxes that fund investments in new infrastructure.The shortfall also complicates Maryland’s ability to take advantage of the federal infrastructure law, which provides the state billions in new money that must be partially matched. Officials said in September that the budget gap could mean tough decisions about how to use federal money.In its statement Friday, MDOT said the plan protects $7 billion in federal investments in transportation.The state’s proposed transportation plan calls for service cuts and increases in fees that would be directly felt across the state, and potentially affect high-profile projects. Its summary says only the planning funds for the Red Line transit system in Baltimore would be maintained. It does not mention the American Legion Bridge connecting Maryland and Virginia but says planning funds for key projects would be protected.The implications of the proposals for the Washington region’s Metro system aren’t clear. The plan’s summary notes the transit system is facing a $750 million deficit as ridership lags in the wake of the pandemic. Officials in Maryland, Virginia and the District, which share responsibility for funding the system, are in discussions about providing more money to help close the gap.The summary of Maryland’s plans includes increasing MVA fees by $40 million a year, while closing two branch offices in Montgomery and Baltimore counties, as well as imposing a hiring freeze. Officials would seek to raise $30 million a year by increasing parking fees at Baltimore-Washington Marshall International Airport and its rail station, while increasing airport drop-off and pickup fees for ride-sharing services.The proposal also calls for eliminating commuter bus service and abandoning a planned expansion of service on MARC’s Brunswick Line. It calls for eliminating or reducing “inefficient” service on other transit lines without affecting core operations in Baltimore. The cuts would delay a transition to electric buses, according to the summary.The summary says a dozen major highway projects would be defunded, affecting a stretch of U.S. 15 in Frederick, a stretch of Interstate 81 in Washington County, the widening of Interstate 97 in Anne Arundel County and a Capital Beltway interchange in Prince George’s County.Spending on airport construction would largely be spared because of restrictions imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the summary.The plans were laid out privately to lawmakers this week, according to people familiar with the briefings, and are expected to be publicly unveiled in the coming days.

Washington Post,Olympic swimmer Klete Keller avoids prison time for role in Jan. 6 riot,2023-12-01 19:09:00,Dave Sheinin,"It was Klete Keller’s Team USA Olympic jacket that made him such an easily identifiable participant in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. It was his status as a five-time Olympic medalist that kept his case in the media. And it was his Olympic fame that, in part, prompted the U.S. government to recommend a 10-month prison sentence, despite his remorse and cooperation, as a deterrent.But it ultimately was Keller’s Olympian background that helped him avoid prison after federal judge Richard J. Leon, citing Keller’s potential influence on young people as a reason, handed him a sentence of six months’ home detention, three years’ probation and 360 hours of community service during a hearing Friday afternoon.“I expect you to succeed,” Leon, a 2002 George W. Bush appointee, told Keller sternly after handing down his sentence.“Thank you, your Honor,” Keller, 41, replied. “I will not let you down.”The ruling brought to a close Keller’s nearly three-year odyssey through the U.S. legal system, including his Jan. 14, 2021, arrest and indictment on seven counts; his September 2021 guilty plea to a felony charge of obstruction of an official proceeding; his months of cooperation with the government in other Jan. 6 cases; and his appearance Friday at courtroom 18 of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington for sentencing.A three-time Olympian with two gold medals, a silver and two bronzes, Keller is best remembered for swimming the anchor leg on the men’s 800-meter freestyle relay at the 2004 Athens Games — a quartet that also included American legends Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte — and out-touching Australian standout Ian Thorpe to secure the gold.Keller’s relatively light sentence was a rarity: Of the more than 200 defendants convicted of felonies stemming from their actions in the Capitol attack, only about a dozen have received sentences of home detention, according to a Washington Post database. In all, more than 1,200 people have been charged in connection with the riot, according to the U.S. Justice Department.A towering presence at 6-foot-6 and 250 pounds, Keller wore a blue blazer, white shirt, dark paisley tie, khakis and brown shoes. He sat mostly expressionlessly during the 40-minute hearing, as assistant U.S. attorney Troy A. Edwards Jr. laid out the government’s case for prison time, and Keller’s attorney, Zachary A. Deubler, argued for probation.While federal sentencing guidelines called for a sentence of 17-21 months, prosecutors were seeking just a 10-month prison sentence for Keller, calling his actions on Jan. 6 “unconscionable” and “a stain on this country’s narrative” — but acknowledging his lack of physical violence during the riot, the remorse he has shown in the aftermath and his cooperation with the government.“We should send a message that … what Mr. Keller did [on Jan. 6] others cannot do,” Edwards argued. A sentence of probation, he said, would send “a message that you can do this and not be punished adequately.”Edwards, however, noted Keller’s cooperation as a witness in other cases and his sense of remorse. “I’ve looked him in the eye many times,” Edwards said. “… I sense what he felt was deep remorse for the damage he has done to institutions he once represented” as an American Olympian.Leon agreed: “Unless he’s the greatest con man of all time … there’s no question about [his being] remorseful.”Even before Deubler spoke on Keller’s behalf, Leon called the case “maybe the most unique” of any of the Jan. 6 cases and said, “If ever a case screamed out for probation, this is it.” When Deubler described Keller as a “flawless probationer” for his frequent and fruitful cooperation with prosecutors in other Jan. 6 cases, Leon said: “True.”Keller also addressed the court, saying, “I have no excuse,” and acknowledging his actions “damaged our electoral process and disgraced our great country.” He apologized to lawmakers, police, family and friends. He also vowed, “I will not repeat the mistakes of my past.”Keller spent about 50 minutes in the Capitol on Jan. 6, leading chants of “F--- Nancy Pelosi!” and “F--- Chuck Schumer!” and at one point yanking his elbow away from a police officer trying to clear the building. While Keller did not commit overt violence, the government argued Keller’s unlawful actions, refusal to obey police orders to leave and “imposing physical presence” constituted “violence and/or a credible threat of violence.”At another point that day, Keller joined rioters in a rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” which he had sung from the podium during the medal ceremonies following his two Olympic relay victories. After finally leaving the Capitol, Keller threw his Team USA jacket in a trash can on the way back to his hotel and later destroyed his cellphone with a hammer.“Klete Derik Keller once wore the American flag as an Olympian,” the government’s sentencing memo began. “On Jan. 6, 2021, he threw that flag in the trash can.”In his attorney’s sentencing memo and in his own letter to the court, Keller sought to link his personal and professional woes — including a separation from his then-wife, the loss of visitation rights with his children, and a period of joblessness and homelessness during which he briefly lived out of his car — to his decision to enter the Capitol with the other rioters.“I felt my relationship with my children was taken from me without any consideration of the facts,” Keller wrote. “I felt similarly with the way election irregularities were seemingly dismissed.”But rather than defend his actions, Keller called them “reckless” and the decision to enter the Capitol “one of the worst … of my life.”In detailing his life since his guilty plea, Keller revealed he had remarried in the spring of 2022 and gotten his job back as a real estate agent at a firm in Colorado Springs.Keller “is genuinely one of the kindest men I have ever met,” read a letter of support, credited to one of his managers at the firm, submitted with his sentencing memo. “He has made a tremendous impact, not only on our business, but on my family and community.” Other letters of support noted Keller has begun offering free swim lessons to kids and has volunteered with a literacy program for prisoners.In weighing the government’s suggested sentence of 10 months in prison Friday, Leon said Keller could be of more use to society by “being out in the community” — speaking to teenagers and youth groups about his learning experiences.“I think that’s a more valuable use of your time,” Leon said, “than having you sit in some jail cell.”",6598,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2023/12/01/klete-keller-sentencing-jan-6-capitol/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,defendant succeed make honor reply convict hour finally begin leon back dozen car troy trash country expect spent stem connection told shirt official judge phelps deubler thorpe blazer disgrace physical team probationer homelessness vowed literacy clear mistake fruitful child swim presence order write similarly action damage reckless michael fact odyssey unconscionable justice courtroom guilty flawless olympic yank offering reveal remarry richard spoke expressionlessly prison fame friend chuck kindest olympian sought cell keller job briefly group chant quartet anchor rioter flag dark overt process volunteer young reason behalf courthouse proceed read medal send participant memo tremendous plea medalist narrative remorse violence electoral freestyle irregularity witness service attorney barrett guideline credible tower elbow relatively zachary stain leg submit kid khaki described easily valuable legend support remember riot leave light minute scream standout firm ian probation visitation officer nancy note hand prosecutor wore receive ruling gold learn laid court impact aftermath sung government relationship bronze building klete seek home arrest edward unlawful legal day relay great appointee identifiable punish personal include repeat ultimately charge community separation away manager blue destroyed acknowledge attack september period bush prompt athens consideration rendition pelosi lead felony ceremony joblessness police free banner sentence time refusal teenager status link show obey white weigh shoe appearance australian message genuinely brown threw credit accord deep indictment constitute enter capitol pound brought avoid society call cooperation question secure year paisley apologize sat seemingly address f rarity prettyman follow lack real election background obstruction lochte institution agent woe george spring federal speak case threat game frequent join hearing commit lawmaker detention lesson agree program recommend sternly state youth cellphone unique impose jacket close suggest system business medium part professional live usa potential argue count influence washington detail american ryan victory despite jail post felt loss point eye database podium family represent derik assistant estate excuse month silver schumer letter friday united defend tie decision life colorado,-0.6053,0.1364049712033949,8.509171102661593,0.4476593052680009,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,Mystics’ Shakira Austin has surgery; Kristi Toliver hired by Phoenix,2023-12-01 17:57:00,Kareem Copeland,"Washington Mystics center Shakira Austin underwent hip surgery Wednesday to repair a torn labrum, a procedure that will keep the former Maryland standout out four to six months, the team announced Friday.That timeline would put Austin, the third pick of the 2022 draft, in danger of missing at least the start of training camp, which opens in late April.Austin’s hip issues began June 25, when she was carried off the court in New York with what was then announced as a hip strain. Austin missed nearly two months, returned for a short spell in late August and then was out for the remainder of the season.General Manager Mike Thibault said Wednesday’s procedure was a success and the team is optimistic she will make a full return. He declined to say when the team knew the strain became a tear.“We’ve known the general gist of the injury from the start,” Thibault said, “but in talking to the hip specialists at the time, there was no reason to act rashly about it. We just took a timely, conservative approach. We eventually just shut her down completely, and then the doctors wanted to wait and see how she did after the season.”The 6-foot-5 Austin, a former All-Met at Riverdale Baptist, averaged 10.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 0.9 blocks in 2023 — all career highs.“I’m just trying to figure what’s best for me moving forward and continue to make the right decisions for my career,” Austin said after the season ended. “I was on a pretty good run, if I must say. I was feeling really good, confident in myself, and I was figuring stuff out. So for me, I still have a lot to prove.”The Phoenix Mercury announced that Kristi Toliver, whose 14-year WNBA playing career includes four seasons with the Mystics (over two tours), will become an associate head coach.Toliver, 36, tore her ACL while playing with the Mystics in September and was likely to miss the upcoming season while recovering. Though she has not announced her retirement, WNBA rules preclude players from also serving on coaching staffs. A person with knowledge of Toliver’s thinking said she intends to retire.Toliver, who was part of Maryland’s 2006 national championship team, also won two WNBA titles — one with Los Angeles in 2016 and one with the Mystics in 2019.She ranks seventh on the all-time WNBA list for career three-point field goals with 651 and 19th in career assists with 1,300.The Mercury named former NBA and G League assistant Nate Tibbetts head coach in October. Toliver has also served two stints working as an NBA assistant — with the Wizards from 2018 to 2020 and the Mavericks from 2021 to 2023.“I'm thrilled for her,” Thibault said. “This is a chance to go to a situation where I think she'll be leaned upon for her knowledge of the league. The fact that she has coached at the NBA level for two different teams and played for three different teams in the WNBA kind of gives her a broad perspective on how things can work, what should work.",2934,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/01/mystics-shakira-austin-kristi-toliver/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,gist make maryland average camp austin court championship begin knowledge knew riverdale injury pretty associate retirement phoenix staff chance broad wnba specialist nba league include manager team remainder approach september level decline figure timeline rule doctor tore announce upcoming time toliver wizard assist august june kristi procedure career fact goal strain coached draft lean head surgery put work field wednesday torn g shakira forward tibbetts act wait open labrum block spell thibault issue serve different late conservative perspective former lot pick reason success general give repair preclude thrill season completely player national tour maverick title coach stuff shut rank seventh run mike center recover person intend rashly situation played short mercury miss part optimistic return stint underwent acl washington kind hip list continue full point eventually training standout baptist assistant feel month mystic timely play confident rebound angeles october start talk danger move decision york carry,0.9528,0.1022494887525562,7.7755782312925135,0.4353442056028262,0,2023-12-01

ABC,No. 4 Florida State QB Rodemaker a game-time decision vs No. 15 Louisville in ACC title game,2023-12-01 17:27:00,The Associated Press,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- No. 4 Florida State might have to turn to third-string quarterback Brock Glenn to start the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game against 15th-ranked Louisville on Saturday night.Tate Rodemaker, who made his second career start in the team’s regular-season finale at Florida, has been limited in practice this week while recovering from a concussion. It's another potential setback at the QB position for the Seminoles, who appear to be one victory away from making the College Football Playoff.Rodemaker left the game briefly in the fourth quarter after getting hit in the head while sliding, a targeting call that resulted in an ejection. He returned a few plays later and handed off to Trey Benson for a game-sealing touchdown run in FSU's 24-15 victory.Seminoles coach Mike Norvell said Friday at a news conference for the two ACC coaches that Rodemaker initial passed on-field concussion tests Saturday night but had symptoms a day later. Rodemaker has been able to participate in some parts of practice, but Glenn has gotten the bulk of the work leading into the game.“That's going to be something that's going to go up until game day and we'll continue on with our process of evaluation and see where it goes from there,"" Norvell said.Rodemaker completed 12 of 25 passes for 134 yards against the Gators. Rodemaker replaced Heisman Trophy candidate and ACC player of the year Jordan Travis a week early after Travis suffered a season-ending injury to his left leg against North Alabama.Now the Seminoles could be switching QBs again.“The game plan doesn't have to change a whole lot,"" Norvell said. “It's the same thing we faced a week ago, going and playing our last regular-season game. We knew that (Glenn) was going to be one play away. He had to be ready for that situation, and he was.""Glenn, a freshman, has played in just three games this season and only completed two passes for 35 yards in mop-up duty against North Alabama. The Seminoles surely would prefer to get Rodemaker back, but he has hurdles to cross before being cleared.“We know the process we have to go through and there's certain benchmarks that we’ll go through and see as we lead up to the game day or to game time, and we’ll see where he’s at,"" Norvell said. “But all those guys are ready and they’re prepared if their number gets called.”___Get alerts on the latest AP Top 25 poll throughout the season.

Washington Post,"With an incoming boss and evolving roster, USWNT looks to reinvent itself",2023-12-01 15:00:00,Steven Goff,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — The U.S. women’s national soccer team, a model of excellence and consistency across decades, arrived in South Florida this week in a state of transition following one of the lowest moments in program history.Luminaries have retired and veterans were left off the roster for a pair of friendlies against China, starting Saturday afternoon at DRV PNK Stadium. A wave of young players swept into training camp and fresh tactical approaches are being implemented ahead of the Paris Olympics next summer.Ah yes, there is also one other major shift taking place: Twila Kilgore, the interim head coach in charge since the post-World Cup fallout earlier this year, is collaborating with her successor, Emma Hayes, who flew in from London to meet the players and begin laying the groundwork for her full-time arrival in May.Hayes, who coaches the Chelsea FC women’s team, was back on a plane Thursday, leaving daily operations to Kilgore and clear messages to the players that things are about to change.“I know it’s the end of the year, but it feels like the start of something new,” midfielder Rose Lavelle said.Hayes’s hiring, amid her 12th season at Chelsea, is a way of “reinventing ourselves and having a new identity and pushing beyond what I think we even have thought was possible,” Lavelle said. “She’s going to bring the whole gamut and bring everybody along.”Several other U.S. players — as well as observers around the world — have commended the hiring of Hayes, who has won six Women’s Super League titles in England and, two years ago, was named FIFA’s world coach of the year.The process of implementing her plans and putting her stamp on the four-time world champions will come with assistance from Kilgore, who will join Hayes’s staff next year.They worked together in selecting 26 players for training camp and, during Hayes’s visit, began formulating tactical strategy and broader direction of the program.The 47-year-old Hayes, who coached youth, college and pros in the United States between 2002 and 2010, met with players individually and spoke to the group at large. She was not made available for interviews because she remains a Chelsea employee, the U.S. Soccer Federation said.“It’s been very natural,” Kilgore said. “There’s been good communication ahead of time and this just felt like another great step. … A lot of excitement and really like a new feeling just having Emma around. She has been focused on player relationships and starting to get to know them.”On-field changes will come about gradually over the next several months. Right away, though, Kilgore said she wants to see improved possession of the ball and “the freedom to try some new ideas.”“I’m looking forward to seeing more bravery,” she said. “They’ve displayed some great bravery but more aggressive going forward.”At the World Cup, the U.S. team not only scored just once in the last three matches but didn’t play with any imagination and was tentative in possession. The round-of-16 shootout defeat to Sweden marked the earliest elimination from a major tournament for the program.Writing for the Telegraph last summer, Hayes said the U.S. team seemed “very stressed.” She said she always admired the team’s “magnificent mentality,” but “mentality alone is not enough to win anymore. Not with the improvements the rest of the world has been making.”The roster selection for this camp, which will also include a rematch with China on Tuesday in Frisco, Tex., was notable for both exclusions and inclusions.Absences include Alex Morgan, Crystal Dunn, Alyssa Naeher, Andi Sullivan and Becky Sauerbrunn. (Megan Rapinoe and Julie Ertz have retired.) Though Kilgore said they remain in the mix, the changes are perhaps a sign of Hayes’s plans to shake things up.Young players in camp include midfielders Korbin Albert, 20, and Olivia Moultrie, 18, and forwards Mia Fishel, 22, Jaedyn Shaw, 19, and Alyssa Thomson, 19. Albert, Moultrie and midfielder Jenna Nighswonger, the NWSL rookie of the year from champion Gotham FC, are seeking to make their senior national team debuts.“There definitely is this kind of strange energy that’s just a bit unfamiliar, and it’s exciting to see where it’s going to take us,” said forward Midge Purce, the MVP of the NWSL championship game, who has returned to the national team this fall after being left off the World Cup squad. “Every time the cycle changes and there’s this much transformation and transition, there’s a new energy, but this one does feel a little different.”What will Hayes bring? She will not discuss her plans until after Chelsea’s season, but some clues could surface Saturday.“Some things we’ve been strategically holding back on are happening now, which is very exciting,” Kilgore said. “And there’s that feeling of just direction that the players have. I think they’re very comfortable. But also it’s just a next step into the evolution of moving in the direction that ultimately we’ll go with Emma in charge.”Fishel is quite familiar with Hayes: She signed with Chelsea this season, in large part because of Hayes. Fishel called her an “amazing person, amazing coach.”Among Hayes’s strengths are communication skills and creating a positive atmosphere, Fishel said.“She’s cracking jokes in meetings this camp, so it’s cool she’s already getting comfortable with the team and showing a little bit about herself,” Fishel said. “She’s also very serious. She has a good balance between being serious and being lighthearted.”Creating bonds at this camp was vital because, given Chelsea’s schedule and her family demands, Hayes probably will not have another opportunity until May. Aside from the English season, the Blues are contenders in the UEFA Women’s Champions League.While Hayes continues her work in London, U.S. defender Naomi Girma said the Americans are on the proper pathway to rebound from disappointment at the Toyko Olympics and World Cup.",5924,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/01/uswnt-emma-hayes-transition-china-friendlies/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain discus make disappointment fishel uefa thursday moultrie championship stamp pair begin jaedyn back marked strange admire pathway staff displayed tuesday clue league excitement probably lay transition employee left definitely strategy girma team arrival paris crystal hire alyssa clear lauderdale ahead becky pnk daily naeher positive college nwsl push imagination rest squad veteran excellence match head spoke albert put low mentality excite visit fresh strength notable group forward rematch process jenna florida fallout young possible contender fifa lot week shake assistance sullivan give sweden joke cup plan player hold sign retire title place meet ball olympics proper possession shootout midfielders operation flew stadium mvp major tactical champion summer kind atmosphere kilgore earlier leave continue shaw interview nighswonger focus swept england roster bond groundwork freedom comfortable magnificent feel morgan gradually gamut rebound federation bravery move win bring defeat fort amid shift tentative saturday energy camp collaborate relationship hayes arrive seek korbin plane great score mix julie vital include model ultimately charge away commend blue olivia approach strategically naomi ago gotham natural time interim wave decade happen crack soccer opportunity ertz cycle show midfielder meeting coached message china skill reinvent elimination work dunn formulate unfamiliar world transformation remains rise woman individually english selection early change identity south call schedule telegraph year exclusion fc surface senior follow thomson megan bit super season available national emma broader observer large game coach drv join implement lavelle familiar program consistency andi person state youth direction afternoon part fall toyko rapinoe return amaze sauerbrunn friendly tournament select cool pro balance american purce aggressive improve felt family training rookie anymore midge communication defender frisco play month evolution twila moment united start improvement create demand successor chelsea step london alex,0.99865,0.050641458474004,8.497410562180576,0.4429193029193028,0,2023-12-01

ABC,LSU's Angel Reese returns after 'long two weeks away',2023-12-01 14:19:00,KATIE BARNES,"""How happy are y'all to see me?"" she said to reporters.Playing for the first time since she was benched Nov. 14, Reese started and had 19 points and nine rebounds in No. 7 LSU's 82-64 victory over No. 9 Virginia Tech. After the game, Reese and coach Kim Mulkey shared a long hug on the sideline.Reese said it felt ""great"" to be back on the court.

I'm back and I'm happy and I'm here and I'm moving forward and I'm going to help take this team as far as I can.""Mulkey also had repeatedly declined to explain Reese's absence, which stretched to four games before her return Thursday. Reese last played for the Tigers (8-1) in their fourth game of the season, a 109-79 victory over Kent State.Reese got off to a slow start, shooting 1-of-4 from the field and 2-of-6 from the free throw line in the first quarter. But she was active on the glass, grabbing five rebounds, including four on the offensive end. She finished the game 5-of-10 from the field and 9-of-16 from the free throw line.She was the second LSU player out of the locker room for pregame shootaround. She jogged out of the tunnel, stopping to bring stadium worker Doretha Bond into a long hug.""I told her, 'Walk by faith, not by sight,'"" Bond said.Before the game, Reese was honored for reaching 1,000 rebounds in her career, which she accomplished during LSU's home opener against Queens University on Nov. 9. Reese walked out to center court to applause from fans at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Mulkey threw the ball up for her to snatch out of the air.It was a joyous and raucous atmosphere at LSU's home court. Students waited in line for multiple hours in the rain to get the best seats in the student section. Some arrived as early as 1:45 p.m. for the 8 p.m. tipoff.Thursday's win gave Mulkey 700 for her career. She became the fastest to reach the milestone as a head coach, in men's or women's basketball.Wearing purple ""Kim Mulkey 700"" shirts as they walked off the court, Reese slung her arm around junior Aneesah Morrow as they approached the student section. They paraded through, collecting high-fives as they went.""Angel is one of the best players I've coached,"" Mulkey said. ""I'm just proud. I'm proud of how she handled herself. She's back to the Angel everybody knows.""Freshman Mikaylah Williams paced the Tigers with 20 points. Morrow added a double-double with 19 points and 15 rebounds.

CNN,Rafael Nadal to make his tennis comeback in Brisbane next month,2023-12-01 08:57:00,not specified,"Tennis great Rafael Nadal has said he will make his long-awaited return from injury at the Brisbane International in January.“After a year away from competition, it’s time to come back,” Nadal said in a video posted on multiple social media platforms Friday. “It will be in Brisbane the first week of January.”Nadal last competed at the Australian Open in January. Entering the tournament as defending champion after winning his 21st grand slam there in 2022, he was hampered by a hip problem and fell to a shock straight-sets defeat against American Mackenzie McDonald in the second round.The Spaniard was initially expected to make his comeback later in the year, but announced during the clay court season that he would miss the Madrid and Rome Masters, as well as the French Open.He had hip surgery in June, keeping him out of action for the remainder of the season.The 37-year-old has posted images and videos of himself on the court in recent weeks as he prepares for a competitive comeback, and the tennis world has been anxiously anticipating the announcement of a return date.The Brisbane International, an ATP 250 event that serves as a warmup for the Australian Open, will mark the beginning of what will likely be Nadal’s last year on Tour.“My idea and my motivation is to try to enjoy and try to say goodbye to all the tournaments that have been important for me in my tennis career during [next] year, and just try to enjoy that, being competitive and enjoying being on the court, something that today is not possible,” he said at a press conference in May.He is also widely expected to make a grand slam return at the Australian Open. In October, before Nadal had officially announced a comeback, tournament director and Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley stated that Nadal would be among the field at the 2024 edition of the competition.Nadal, a 22-time grand slam champion, will have to enter tournaments using either his injury protected ranking or a wildcard entry as a result of tumbling down the rankings due to his absence.He is currently No. 662 in the world.

CNN,Stanley Cup champion Corey Perry ‘deeply sorry’ for his ‘inappropriate’ behavior after Chicago Blackhawks release,2023-12-01 07:16:00,David Close,"Veteran NHL forward Corey Perry apologized on Thursday for the “inappropriate behavior” which saw him waived by the Chicago Blackhawks.The Blackhawks said on Tuesday that Perry “engaged in conduct that is unacceptable” and was “in violation both of the terms of his Standard Player’s Contract and the Blackhawks’ internal policies intended to promote professional and safe work environments.”In a statement released on Thursday, Perry said: “I would like to sincerely apologize to the entire Chicago Blackhawks organization, including ownership, management, coaches, trainers, employees, and my teammates.“As a result of my actions, there has been speculation and rumors. I am sickened by the impact this has had on others, and I want to make it clear that in no way did this situation involve any of my teammates or their families.“Most importantly, I want to directly apologize to those who have been negatively affected and I am sorry for the additional impact to others it has created. My behavior was inappropriate and wrong,” he added.Perry also revealed that he will be seeking professional help in order to tackle his “struggles with alcohol” and that he “will take whatever steps necessary to ensure this never happens again.”CNN has reached out to the Blackhawks and the NHLPA for comment.Perry’s Chicago tenure only lasted five months. He was signed to a one-year deal in July and played in 16 games, scoring four goals and assisting on five others.The 38-year-old was an unexpected healthy scratch for the November 22 game versus the Columbus Blue Jackets – which head coach Luke Richardson described as an “organizational decision” – and had not played since that point.He was waived by the ‘Hawks on Tuesday following an internal investigation.“In the event Mr. Perry clears waivers, we intend to terminate his contract effective immediately,” the team stated.Perry has played in 1,273 NHL games while scoring 421 career goals.

CNN,Dak Prescott furthers MVP campaign with stellar performance in high-scoring Cowboys victory over Seahawks,2023-12-01 07:13:00,Ben Morse,"Dak Prescott continued to further his candidacy for this year’s NFL MVP award after another stellar performance in the Dallas Cowboys’ 41-35 victory over the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday.The 30-year-old quarterback threw almost a perfect game as he masterminded Dallas’ high-scoring win over Seattle, during which the Cowboys overcame two separate eight-point deficits.He threw for 299 yards and three touchdowns – one apiece to CeeDee Lamb, Jake Ferguson and Brandin Cooks – including vital fourth-quarter touchdown and field goal drives to help seal the result.It capped off an excellent month of November for Prescott in which he’s thrown for 1,597 yards, 16 touchdowns and just a single interception and, importantly, played a vital role in the Cowboys’ recent four-game winning streak.After a rocky beginning to the 2023 season, Prescott told reporters, per the NFL: “I’m blessed, I’m super blessed, and I think about that each and every day that I wake up, I’m grateful for that opportunity to do that, and I go and attack the day.“I understand nobody’s opinion defines me, that’s the great part about life and that’s the great opportunity that we all have, that people can say whatever they want, but you know I have the pen, I have the paper and I’m the one writing. So, because I’m playing as well as I am now doesn’t mean I’m going to stop, doesn’t mean I’m going to listen to them now.”Prescott’s performance was the main talking point after what was a thrilling encounter at AT&T Stadium.Both sides provided their fair share of offense, with both totaling over 400 yards on that side of the ball.Seattle, playing on the road on a short week, didn’t look overawed at any stage with quarterback Geno Smith engineering multiple scoring drives to keep his team in the game.More than that, the Seahawks held eight-point leads twice in the second half – with DK Metcalf the standout performer as he finished Thursday’s game with six catches for 134 yards and three touchdowns. The wide receiver ignited the game in the first quarter when he took a Smith pass 73 yards for a touchdown to open Seattle’s scoring.“We’ve played games where the offense has done well and the defense hasn’t, or the defense has had our back when the offense hasn’t done so well,” Metcalf said, per the Seahawks. “So we just have to play a complete game as a team to where we’re hitting on all phases – the offense is executing, the defense is getting stops and special teams is running and hitting. Once we do that, I think we’re going to be a great team.”However, on multiple occasions, Seattle’s defense was unable to slow down Prescott and company.It is the third straight loss for the Seahawks as their playoff push falters. They fall to 6-6 while the Cowboys improve to 9-3.",2762,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/sport/dak-prescott-dallas-cowboys-seattle-seahawks-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231201111312-03-dallas-cowboys-113023.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,paper yard quarter thursday seal dallas begin seattle complete back candidacy opinion lamb single day great score vital told include mastermind special team ceedee touchdown recent straight attack half lead geno slow reporter understand write stage encounter nfl brandin goal opportunity seahawks drive push thrown performer ignite metcalf continued wake threw cook field importantly side open smith ferguson excellent offense wide falter phase year total week apiece cowboy super thrill occasion season pen interception stop fair award prescott dk defines share game defense run role rocky grateful finish unable played listen short part multiple fall mvp performance engineering provide perfect jake dak hit road quarterback bless victory playoff capped improve loss point stellar standout held separate overawe play month receiver talk execute win life november catch overcame,0.9939,0.0,7.481050788091068,0.4637400793650793,0,2023-12-01

CNN,"Meet the Carota Boys, the carrot-clad fan group rooting for Jannik Sinner, Italy’s rising tennis star",2023-12-01 05:12:00,George Ramsay,"Go to a major tennis tournament and it’s hard to miss the Carota Boys, a team of six men decked in full-body, bright-orange carrot costumes. But you might hear them before you see them.The group of 20-somethings are most likely to be found vociferously supporting world No. 4 Jannik Sinner, who, like them, also heralds from northern Italy.It’s only over the past seven or so months that the Carota Boys’ love for Sinner has really blossomed, endearing themselves to the tennis public in the process.“They are more famous than I am, to be honest,” Sinner told reporters during last month’s ATP Tour Finals in Turin, where he was cheered on by his small but dedicated carrot-clad army.The six childhood friends – Lorenzo Ferrato, Francesco Gaboardi, Gianluca Bertorello, Enrico Ponsi, Alessandro Dedominici, and Alberto Mondino – are all from the northwest Italian town of Revello.The conception of the Carota Boys originates with the friends’ tradition of buying tickets for tennis tournaments to celebrate each other’s birthdays. That included this year’s Italian Open in Rome, ahead of which they decided to buy carrot costumes for the occasion.Their inspiration? Sinner had once eaten a carrot (or, in Italian, a carota) during a change of ends at a tournament in Vienna, Austria four years previously, though some drew a connection between the carrots and the tennis star’s orange hair.Either way, the costumes immediately proved a hit.“Before the match and after the match, a lot of people are going crazy with this idea, they’re asking us for a lot of pictures,” Ferrato tells CNN Sport.The fan club wasn’t meant to last longer than a weekend, but after Rome, coffee company Lavazza got in touch and asked about the possibility of funding a trip to the French Open in Paris.Things snowballed from there, and the Carota Boys later found themselves on planes to London for Wimbledon and New York for the US Open, all for the sake of dressing up as carrots and ardently supporting their favorite player. Their year ended closer to home at the ATP Tour Finals, watching Sinner reach the final before losing against Novak Djokovic.“We found a lot of love for Jannik and for us,” Ferrato says about the atmosphere in Turin. During the tournament, they also had the opportunity to meet and play tennis with Sinner.“[There was] some correlation between us,” Ferrato adds. “Jannik and all the Carota Boys are born in a place near the mountains. He loves skiing; for us, it’s the same. He loves family and friends and our team, the Carota Boys, it’s about the friendship that we have.”Gaboardi, who first suggested buying the carrot costumes, agrees: “He’s a guy like us – a normal guy … He has a good mind and I think works a lot towards his future.”Away from the tennis court, the group has also built a sizeable following on social media. They decided to create an Instagram account while traveling by train to Paris for the French Open, and since then have amassed more than 72,000 followers by posting funny, light-hearted videos about their fandom.They also have their own line of merchandise – orange, of course – which includes t-shirts displaying their favorite refrain: “Let’s go Sinner, let’s go!”Now, the Carota Boys are trying to decide what next year will hold. All of them have day jobs and need to take time off work each time they travel to a tournament, but they still have ambitions to make their fan club bigger and louder.“With the Carota Boys, we’ve brought more people to cheer Jannik, so this makes us so happy and proud,” says Ferrato.“It will be very cool to create something like a fan club worldwide, like [former MotoGP world champion] Valentino Rossi, or, I don’t know, in Formula One, for [Max] Verstappen or [Michael] Schumacher, something like this.”Sinner is still only 22 years old, part of a crop of talented young players including Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz and Denmark’s Holger Rune.The past year has been Sinner’s best to date, winning four ATP Tour titles, reaching the semifinals of Wimbledon, and defeating Djokovic in the ATP Finals group stage before the Serb got his revenge in the final.When the pair met again in the Davis Cup last month, Sinner triumphed against the world No. 1 for a second time and went on to lift the trophy with Italy as his country defeated Australia 2-0 in the final.Rangy and fast around the court, but also capable of hitting some of the heaviest ground shots in the men’s game, Sinner has developed into one of the toughest opponents on the ATP Tour.“He’s an all-around player,” Djokovic has previously said. “He hits the ball in the sweet spot more or less on any surface, really, and he’s got a lot of talent. He has proven that he’s the future of our sport.”Expectations are now high ahead of the 2024 season, and you know that the Carota Boys will be rooting for their favorite player throughout.“In Italy, we say that we’ll bring bad luck if you do a prediction,” says Ferrato, before adding: “In our minds, we hope that next year will be the one when he wins a grand slam.”For the fans dressed as carrots, Sinner’s first major title would spark their wildest, noisiest celebrations to date.",5164,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/sport/carota-boys-jannik-sinner-tennis-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231127165513-01-carota-boys.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,meant max friendship title tradition coffee dedicate schumacher wild dress york brought mountain guy cool place austria job plane ball born snowball originates lavazza hard formula carota boy rome jannik former celebration gianluca holger game prediction tournament hope mind toughest found spot mondino atmosphere picture family famous heaviest ponsi correlation honest big champion cnn create club touch player worldwide wimbledon favorite happy serb spaniard valentino costume buying eat small follower date drew social developed alcaraz decide longer prove ticket follow meet closer french funding northwest opponent ahead crop country team past part defeat enrico star group luck possibility semifinal agrees proud open alberto novak home gaboardi buy rossi francesco sweet final add account future company proven triumphed watch trophy talent lose italian medium root carrot vociferously orange skiing suggest work match cheer line trip conception inspiration hold dedominici public include post pair display high play surface major train vienna funny sinner reach normal celebrate cup michael childhood friend told ground reporter away london sake ferrato tour revenge lot hear fast world day month young merchandise year ambition change bring birthday win stage northern australia shot carlos alessandro noisy grand turin opportunity atp italy immediately tennis sizeable lift ardently lorenzo refrain amass course crazy weekend talented herald support davis bertorello expectation blossom previously video time court endear deck season connection hit denmark motogp spark built capable travel paris make djokovic town miss idea love instagram verstappen,0.99805,0.0580945003872966,7.370337078651687,0.454793720335889,0,2023-12-01

I kind of hung through there and I did not finish off my round the way I needed to and consequently it kind of went sideways at the end.”The 47-year-old finished at three-over 75 and in 18th place of the 20-man field. Meanwhile, 2023 Open champion Brian Harman and Tony Finau sit in a tie for first place after a five-under 67 first round at Albany Golf Club.“I’m a little bit sore, that’s for sure,” Woods said after the round. “We got some stuff to do tonight to get ready for tomorrow and then we get back in the gym and get right after it tomorrow and hopefully pull some better numbers.”Woods underwent ankle surgery in April after enduring “constant” pain across his three rounds at Augusta National during the Masters in April.On Tuesday, Woods told reporters his goal for next year is to play once per month.“I think the best scenario would be maybe a tournament a month,” Woods said. “I think that’s realistic, whether that’s – you would have to start with maybe at Genesis (the Genesis Invitational in February) and something in March, near the Players (Championship).“Again, we have set up right now the biggest events are one per month. It sets itself up for that. Now, I need to get myself ready for all that.

After scoring a touchdown, Hill grabbed a camera from University of Miami student Kevin Fitzgibbons on the field sidelines and performed a backflip selfie.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Fitzgibbons said he shared a friendship with Hill, describing him as “one of my best friends.” Fitzgibbons said Hill noticed him standing in the sidelines after scoring the touchdown and “surprised me by grabbing my phone and doing a backflip.”“It was the coolest moment ever, and I ran into the tunnel to send the clip to the NFL,” the student said in his video. Fitzgibbons said he began working for the NFL at Dolphins home games in 2022.Hill was not fined for the incident, but the team received a 15-yard penalty, the NFL said.Fitzgibbons said he was told by the league that whether he knew Hill’s celebration was coming or not, he still had to be disciplined and he should not have jumped on the sidelines.“One of the best moments of my life turned upside down in a matter of seconds,” Fitzgibbons said in the video. “I get why the NFL had to make this decision and wish I could have done something to prevent it, but I am thankful for the memory that Tyreek gave me. This was the greatest job in the world and I never took a day for granted.”CNN has not been able to reach Fitzgibbons for further comment. His post has more than 36 million views and has garnered the support of Lebron James, sports betting website DraftKings and Hill.On Thursday, Hill said he has a long history with Fitzgibbons and spoke with him about his credentials being suspended.“I told him, ‘Don’t let this get to you,’” he said. “’Just hold your head up. You’re still young. Continue to do what you love.’ Me and him are going to continue to work together. I told him I was going to cover his salary, whatever the NFL was going to pay him or whatever. I told him I was going to make sure that I do what’s right and take care of you, make sure you’re not out of a job. That’s my guy.”A source with the NFL confirmed Fitzgibbons’ credentials were “temporarily suspended due to multiple violations of NFL policy.”The source noted Fitzgibbons remains a contracted employee and is welcomed and encouraged to participate in any number of other projects involving off-field league events as well as personal projects with players.The Dolphins are 8-3 so far this season and lead the AFC East, with Hill scoring 10 touchdowns.",2701,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/sport/tyreek-hill-nfl-videographer-credentials-suspended-spt/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210602152422-david-close2.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,suspend make history encourage thursday stand tunnel reach begin matter knew wish event dolphin home day score great told camera league personal employee confirm sport upside memory videographer team thankful comment touchdown notice draftkings cover sideline lead celebration coolest discipline surprised violation penalty salary number afc nfl formerly clip due grab response head spoke cnn describe work field jumped job world phone ran backflip fin remains kevin east website wide young panther long give friendship send season hold perform share game place miami welcome pay bet carolina student multiple grabbed involve contract university lebron support post participate continue james twitter tyreek x garner video prevent turn fitzgibbons incident credential project view note october hill receiver moment temporarily million receive win life decision source,0.9786,0.1110699740836727,7.661544117647058,0.5207556935817806,0,2023-11-30

Washington Post,Air traffic controller’s decision-making spotlighted in Austin near-miss files,2023-11-30 15:22:00,Ian Duncan,"An FAA supervisor and facility manager in Austin called into question an air traffic controller’s decision to authorize a Southwest Airlines jet in dense fog as a FedEx cargo plane loomed close behind, according to interview transcripts released Wednesday by the National Transportation Safety Board.“I cannot for the life of me understand how he thought that was going to work,” air traffic manager Stephen Martin told investigators. “This was just really poor judgment.”As the Southwest Boeing 737 carrying 128 passengers and crew began to take off, the cargo plane was trying to make a landing on the same runway. The FedEx crew noticed the danger with moments to spare, pulling up and circling around to avoid a collision. Investigators have said the planes came within about 100 feet.No one was injured, but the incident was one of a string of close calls this year that has highlighted chronic issues with recruitment and technology upgrades at the Federal Aviation Administration. The new documents show how those problems were at play in Austin: Staff told investigators that they had long-standing concerns about a shortage of air traffic controllers, grueling overtime schedules and the lack of an alerting system that could warn of an impending crash.The NTSB investigation is ongoing and the files do not draw conclusions about the cause of the incident, but they underscore how the near miss was linked to the decisions made by a single air traffic controller.FAA officials said the agency doesn’t comment on open investigations. The agency has previously said the Austin airport would be the first of 95 facilities to receive a new training simulator in January.On the morning of Feb. 4, Austin-Bergstrom International Airport was blanketed in fog. Air traffic controller Damian Campbell couldn’t see the Southwest jet from the tower but cleared it to take off. Campbell told NTSB investigators that the airline’s pilots tended to move quickly, so he expected there was plenty of time before the cargo jet would need to be on the runway.“They were rolling, I assume,” Campbell said. But when he realized he couldn’t hear the sound of the 737′s engines, Campbell said he knew something was wrong.Onboard the approaching FedEx cargo jet, Capt. Hugo F. Carvajal III later told NTSB investigators that he was irritated when he realized a plane was being cleared to take off in front of his aircraft and asked his co-pilot to confirm they could land.Next to him, first officer Robert J. Bradeen Jr. began glancing out the window and spotted a light that didn’t match the runway lights, then soon saw the silhouette of a plane.“I said, ‘Go around, go around, go around,’” Bradeen recalled.Campbell told investigators that looking back, he could have prevented the Southwest plane from departing. “Hindsight being 20/20 definitely could have held them,” Campbell said.Susan Green, the supervisor on duty at the time of the near miss, told the NTSB that Campbell’s handling of the situation “didn’t meet my expectations at all.”“In this scenario, I never would have rolled that departure,” Green said, according to a transcript of her interview.Campbell and Mark Fellner, the union representative who accompanied him to the interview, could not be reached for comment. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association declined to comment on an open NTSB investigation.Fellner, in his own interview with investigators, said he had been asking for more controllers to be assigned to the facility since 2017. He said the airport has become increasingly busy, but “nobody seems to care.”“The data is really just scary and depressing,” Fellner said.Campbell was working an overtime shift at the time of the incident. The controllers’ union says six-day workweeks are common as the FAA struggles to recruit and train enough staff and as traffic levels grow. A panel of experts commissioned by the FAA reached similar conclusions about the problem posed by understaffing.Green told investigators that fatigue and low morale had taken a toll on the facility. Martin said a staffing increase in October 2022 was enough to “stop the bleeding.”In other near misses in Boston and New York, an alert system called ASDE-X provided an early warning of danger. The system is not installed in Austin and Campbell said he thought it was needed five years ago.",4347,https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/11/30/ntsb-austin-fedex-southwest-close-call/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lack international passenger data runway pilot administration moment technology workweek draw union busy toll increasingly ongoing handle fellner make airline engine faa year authorize level traffic roll clear back commission safety green circle panel tend definitely close assume quickly boston expert simulator irritated scenario pull silhouette martin time link system underscore investigator interview transportation officer plane highlight train accord provide accompany call agency move release previously bradeen light capt hugo match meet fog jet iii aircraft october knew morning facility duty decision single land issue approach grueling glance document spot shift association depress departure conclusion question open wednesday supervisor shortage hear receive recruitment expectation expect manager transcript schedule loom fatigue robert instal stop depart controller airport similar notice comment york understand begin southwest plenty front struggle string early national work life training hindsight official investigation sound blanket austin realize ago told mark overtime impend pose carry file recruit tower spare reach miss aviation poor scary upgrade low alert decline show common campbell representative assign play damian problem grow avoid incident fedex held concern prevent air danger carvajal cargo chronic confirm injured federal warn increase ntsb staff dense crew situation boeing window stephen collision,-0.97885,0.20703933747412,10.329088639200997,0.405559352927774,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,Maverick Carter told feds he used illegal bookie to bet thousands on NBA,2023-11-30 15:13:00,Gus Garcia-Roberts,"LOS ANGELES — Maverick Carter, the longtime manager and business partner of Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James, admitted to betting on NBA games through an illegal bookie, according to federal law enforcement records reviewed by The Washington Post.Carter made the admission during a November 2021 interview with federal agents investigating bookie Wayne Nix, who has since pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his role running a sprawling offshore sports-betting ring. Carter told agents he “could not remember placing any bets on the Lakers,” according to an investigative report summarizing the interview.A spokesman for Carter and James confirmed the interview occurred. “In 2021 and before 38 states and the District of Columbia legalized sports betting, Maverick Carter was interviewed a single time by federal law enforcement regarding their investigation into Wayne Nix,” the spokesman, Adam Mendelsohn, said in a statement. “Mr. Carter was not the target of the investigation, cooperated, was never charged, and never contacted again on the matter.”He declined to answer questions about James, saying Carter’s wagering “has nothing to do with him.” In the law enforcement interview, Carter denied placing bets for other people.Carter, 42, is inexorably linked with James, who for two decades has been the largely scandal-free and business-savvy face of the NBA. Childhood friends from Akron, Ohio, they co-own a media company valued at hundreds of millions of dollars and are minority owners in the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool, the English soccer club.The revelation that Carter gambled on NBA games comes as the league and broader American sports industry fully embrace legal betting — including the pending sale of an NBA team to a casino magnate — despite concerns about the integrity of the games.Carter and his attorneys told investigators, the records show, that he placed approximately 20 bets on football and basketball games over the course of a year, with each bet ranging from $5,000 to $10,000. An indictment in the case states that in November 2019, amid the Lakers’ championship season, Nix’s partner Edon Kagasoff told a “business manager for a professional basketball player” via text that he could increase his wagers up to $25,000 on NBA games.NBA policies bar players, team and league officials from gambling on NBA games, but the league does not have purview over business managers or agents. The National Basketball Players Association, the players union, bars agents but not business managers from betting on the NBA. Both the NBA and the players association declined to comment.Nix and his partners had a client list full of athletes and others in sports, according to prosecutors, including former MLB star Yasiel Puig. But Nix had particularly deep connections in basketball, previously unreported records show.Retired NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen also admitted to placing at least one bet with Nix, according to a separate investigative report reviewed by The Post. And Nix golfed in a member’s only tournament at Michael Jordan’s exclusive golf club in Florida, where other participants included multiple NBA team owners, in addition to stars in other sports, Hollywood, finance and the media. There are no indications in court records reviewed by The Post that Jordan, who until recently owned the NBA’s Charlotte Hornets, bet on sports through Nix.Jordan’s longtime agent David Falk declined to comment on what if any relationship Jordan has with Nix. Jordan’s business manager, Estee Portnoy, did not respond to a request for comment. Pippen did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Though Carter and Pippen were not previously identified in public court records, their interviews were referenced in a court dispute earlier this year between prosecutors and Puig. Puig is the only athlete client to be charged in connection with Nix’s operation, accused not of illegal betting but of lying to investigators, which he has denied. In legal filings, prosecutor Jeff Mitchell stated that Carter and Pippen made “arguably” or “technically” false statements during their interviews but then clarified them. Neither was charged. Puig’s trial is scheduled for January.The Justice Department declined to respond to specific questions for this story. After a reporter sought comment from Mitchell concerning Carter and Pippen, the prosecutor filed a motion citing that request and seeking to seal more records in the case “to prevent further dissemination of the identities of other Nix clients.”Nix and several others have been indicted in connection to the betting ring, in which a network of American bookies used a Costa Rican call center and website to place bets. Other than Puig, the indictments refer to but do not identify prominent figures in basketball, football and baseball who were allegedly among the illegal network’s 1,000-plus clients.Nix’s own sentencing has been repeatedly delayed. His attorney, Steven Madison, declined to comment.Carter and Pippen were among dozens of “non-target witnesses” whom prosecutors and agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the IRS interviewed starting in September 2021, court records show. By then, the agents had already searched the homes of several of the bookies, and at least six targets of the investigation had pledged to cooperate.Pippen told the agents in a phone interview that he considered Nix a “good friend” and golfing buddy. He denied knowing that Nix was a bookie, according to the interview report, and said, vaguely, that he believed Nix, a former minor league baseball player, lived off “the fruits of his labor.”Pippen told investigators he “did not recall” placing bets with Nix, including on the 2019 Super Bowl, the report shows. But then the agents confronted Pippen with a specific bet that he placed on that event. Nix had offered Pippen a bet of $20,000 for a risk of $2,500, the report shows — an apparent example of the sort of promotions Nix gave some gamblers.Pippen initially said he didn’t recall that bet, the report states, but then thought about it and remembered it. He told the federal agents that Nix “waived” his loss on that bet.During the interview, one of the agents cautioned Pippen about the federal statute making it a crime to lie to federal investigators. The statute was among the charges levied against Martha Stewart, the report notes, though the agents told the basketball great that they “didn’t foresee Pippen’s answers triggering a violation” of the statute. Still, they “requested that Pippen provide truthful responses to the questions.”The following month, investigators conducted a video interview with Carter, who was a passenger in his own car and joined in the interview by two attorneys. According to a report detailing the interview, Mitchell, the prosecutor, also explained to Carter, as investigators routinely do, the statute making it a crime to lie during such an interview.Agents showed Carter photos of several people involved in the betting operation, according to the report, and he said he recognized just one of them: Nix, with whom he had played cards in Las Vegas on a couple of occasions.Carter said he met Nix in 2017 or 2018 through a friend named Jeff from Ohio, whose last name Carter said he couldn’t remember. But other records shed light on connections between Carter and Nix’s operation.In court and law enforcement records, prosecutors have identified an allegedly “significant client” of Nix’s sportsbook: Joey Schottenstein, son of Jay Schottenstein, an Ohio billionaire who has helmed companies including American Eagle Outfitters. The Schottensteins are major Ohio State University donors, and LeBron James has referred to them as his “family.” James attended the wedding of Joey’s brother, Jeffrey, and he and Carter have helped promote Jeffrey’s clothing label, TACKMA — which stands for “They All Can Kiss My A--”.Court records show that in 2019, Puig settled part of his own gambling debt by mailing Joey Schottenstein two checks totaling $200,000. In addition, Kagasoff, an admitted bookie who prosecutors said “operated the day-to-day functions of Nix’s gambling business,” counts Jeffrey Schottenstein among his friends on the payment app Venmo, which reveals some of the contacts in a user’s phone. (Kagasoff’s attorney did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)The investigative report does not state whether agents asked Carter if the man he knew as Jeff from Ohio was Jeffrey Schottenstein. Carter’s spokesman did not respond to that question from The Post. Jeffrey and Joey Schottenstein did not respond to requests to comment.Carter told the agents that when he was in Las Vegas, Nix would tag along with him and others. Outside of Las Vegas, Carter said, he and Nix talked only on the phone. When the agents asked if he still had Nix’s phone number, Carter said he deleted it after he learned that the government “was looking” at Nix. Carter shared with the investigators his own phone number that he said he texted Nix from, and said that he utilized “no other phones.”Carter acknowledged that he knew Nix was involved in gambling and said Nix owed him money from both poker and football. The 20 bets he placed through Nix were on college football, the NFL and the NBA, Carter told the agents, and he said he would text Nix his bets or place them directly through Sand Island Sports, the Costa Rican website Nix used. Carter said he didn’t know of Edon Kagasoff.Carter said he paid and received winnings from Nix via wire transfers and cash, identifying one of his employees who he said handled the cash drops. The federal agents asked Carter if he had been “truthful and not misleading” in any of his responses, according to the investigative report, and Carter said he was.Agents brought up a different Carter employee, Tramonte Pointer, and Carter acknowledged that Pointer also had done money pickups and drops, the report states. Pointer did not respond to requests to comment. Asked again, Carter said he was being truthful.Then, after the interview, one of Carter’s attorneys, Colin Jennings, emailed the prosecutor, Mitchell. In fact, Jennings wrote, the only person involved in the cash drops for Carter was Pointer, his driver, who is nicknamed “Cheese.” But since Pointer was driving Carter at the time of the interview, Jennings wrote, Carter “did not feel comfortable” discussing him. Additionally, Jennings said that Pointer dealt with Kagasoff “and may have spoken to others associated with him.”Jennings also said Carter “may have communicated” with Nix via another phone, and the lawyer provided that number. Finally, Jennings wrote that while Carter does not recall how much he gambled with Nix, his bets were typically between $5,000 to $10,000, meaning the cash drops were likely around $20,000 to $40,000. “We hope that this clarification and supplementation is clear and if you need any further information please let me know,” Jennings wrote.Four months later, in March 2022, indictments were unsealed against Nix and fellow bookies in his operation. Puig was also later indicted.Prosecutor Mitchell referred to both Pippen and Carter, without naming them, in a filing earlier this year in the case against Puig, who has alleged that he is a victim of selective prosecution because he is Black. A judge ultimately rejected that argument. In response to Puig’s motion, Mitchell described “false statements” by a “prominent Black athlete” — Pippen — and a “Black manager of a prominent Black athlete” — Carter — who were not charged.",11584,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/30/maverick-carter-bet-nba-games/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,shed story partner billionaire company jay union loss outfitter scottie significant indict review check handle florida investigate clear settle medium broader industry directly attorney witness magnate akron sentence recently million boston justice ultimately government baseball statement pledge motion routinely app famer adam detail time count supplementation reference mislead investigator drive interview website texted agent argument provide security brother court call inexorably fully bookie addition filing previously investigative light report gamble wayne associate nfl irs schottenstein recognize identity single particularly puig event repeat drop search golfing basketball childhood apparent false enforcement question minor note vaguely dissemination joey write league record eagle university email additionally red truthful sand text manager allegedly judge played seek owe sox stewart brought finally payment falk believe legalize selective occur victim policy portnoy madison crime soccer communicate pickup target comment stem nickname sort venmo relationship season pointer longtime official waive operate jordan told carter steven conduct largely confront despite cash tournament give business charge plead yasiel live james former risk caution jeffrey promotion refer consider total discuss schottensteins ring foresee wire lawyer remember answer different car mlb user clothing follow decade martha wedding buddy integrity tag championship player costa earlier club value prevent utilized revelation join mitchell kiss multiple estee explain september hope response indication david offshore professional owner federal march hundred sportsbook hall nix liverpool run minority athlete michael information participant delete typically post passenger acknowledge golf illegal separate promote edon tackma jennings american role dispute make center great year poker reporter feel seal lakers part island include initially exclusive spokesman pending regard approximately clarify employee request mr amid team sprawl technically clarification admit arguably link home game course unreported operation prosecutor start paid accord involve trigger hollywood angeles interviewed bowl football spoken deny charlotte share card finance prosecution mail sought november hornet purview client allege bet homeland knew indictment dozen sport association contact learn talk deep accuse photo english kagasoff full number summarize specific money month prominent receive couple network schedule bar fruit violation phone attend fellow connection range reject state function lebron place unsealed repeatedly person washington offer national investigation figure helm identify debt colin embrace file recall donor mendelsohn dealt tramonte label golfed guilty winning friend columbia ohio district nba pippen list wager statute major public decline maverick driver show admission cooperate member law delayed video meaning black rican described respond case casino legal concern star jeff trial lie department levy college fact comfortable confirm increase superstar vega stand reveals dollar super transfer,0.33795,0.1553867403314917,9.941329639889195,0.4270516717325227,0,2023-11-30
ABC,Indiana hires James Madison's Curt Cignetti as head coach,2023-11-30 14:59:00,ABC News,"Indiana fired Tom Allen on Sunday, a day after the Hoosiers completed their third consecutive losing season.Allen, who had led Indiana since 2017, finished 33-49 as Hoosiers coach.

Washington Post,Bronny James cleared to return for USC basketball after cardiac arrest,2023-11-30 14:56:00,Ben Golliver,"Bronny James, the 19-year-old son of NBA star LeBron James, has been fully cleared by doctors to return to basketball activities for the University of Southern California following his recovery from a sudden cardiac arrest he suffered during a July practice, a James family spokesperson said Thursday.“Bronny will have a final evaluation with USC staff this week, resume practice next week and return to games soon after,” the James family said in a statement. “The James family would like to express their gratitude to the incredible medical team, the entire USC community, and especially the countless friends, family and fans for their love and support. Fight On!”The Trojans, who opened their season this month, are off to a 5-2 start without James, a freshman who chose USC over Oregon and Ohio State as a four-star recruit. James was selected as a McDonald’s all-American during his senior year at Sierra Canyon School outside Los Angeles thanks to his outside shooting ability and defense. Projected as one of the country’s top name, image and likeness earners this fall, James has been viewed as a potential first-round pick in the 2024 NBA draft and has accumulated more than 7.6 million Instagram followers.But the start of his college career was delayed by the July 24 practice incident, which led to his hospitalization in Los Angeles after he lost consciousness. James was discharged after a short stay at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and his family sought further medical evaluations by doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey. In August, the James family announced he had a treatable heart defect and would pursue a return to basketball.“The probable cause of Mr. James’s sudden cardiac arrest has been identified,” the James family said in August. “It is an anatomically and functionally significant congenital heart defect which can and will be treated. We are very confident in Bronny’s full recovery and return to basketball in the very near future.”Bronny James is the eldest of LeBron and Savannah James’s three children. The 6-foot-3 guard rose to national prominence early in his standout high school career and has drawn media coverage for both his basketball skills and his professional video gaming associations. James, who remained largely out of the public eye immediately after the incident, has been more visible at USC football and basketball games in recent weeks.The 38-year-old LeBron James, who is in his 21st professional season, has long expressed a desire to play with his son in the NBA, hoping to become basketball’s version of Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr., who were teammates with MLB’s Seattle Mariners in 1990 and 1991. James’s contract with the Los Angeles Lakers includes a player option for the 2024-25 season, which theoretically could help maximize his ability to team up with Bronny James as soon as next summer.At the Lakers’ media day in early October, LeBron James said he would dedicate this season to his son.",3014,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/30/bronny-james-cleared-to-return/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,teammate suffer express month maximize version desire doctor evaluation activity confident image sudden project high functionally drawn shoot draft skill announce significant cardiac practice final coverage center rise country year option sierra school clear state hospitalization visible lebron dedicate medium likeness incredible defect lakers eye gratitude include early season national potential griffey million morristown entire mcdonald minnesota probable accumulate identify statement guard team remain prominence clinic earner california largely recruit instagram especially ken pursue hop child friend spokesperson ohio anatomically game discharge james countless nba freshman bronny start long family july angeles contract football fully community stay public lead mariner love standout delayed return chose video mlb sought theoretically ability pick follow defense lose play usc medical october savannah southern trojan senior career arrest incident short player treat oregon week consciousness star august canyon recovery select association recent congenital heart college professional basketball seattle fight day jersey view mayo staff resume treatable support eldest open top full fall university immediately,0.9553,0.19907100199071,10.103470483005369,0.3384649704037459,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,"Deion Sanders, coach of a 4-8 team, wins SI Sportsperson of the Year",2023-11-30 14:12:00,Matt Bonesteel,"Deion Sanders’s Colorado football team last won a game on Oct. 7. The Buffaloes had one of the worst defenses in the nation, allowing 453.3 yards and 34.8 points per game, and their offense nosedived after a thrilling start, failing to reach 20 points in four of their final five games. That decline coincided with Sanders’s much-criticized decision to take play-calling duties away from offensive coordinator Sean Lewis, who since has left to take the head coaching job at San Diego State. None of their four victories came against a team that finished with a winning record. Only one team in the nation committed more penalties than Colorado.And yet on Thursday, Sports Illustrated named Sanders — the coach of a team that finished 4-8 — its Sportsperson of the Year.This led to a host of jokes about whether the honor had been bestowed by the same artificial intelligence that had written consumer product reviews for the publication, bylined by fake writers. Or whether the honor was decided upon in September, when things were going much better for Sanders and Colorado. Or a combination of both.In the article accompanying Sanders’s honor, SI’s Pat Forde (a real person and highly respected reporter) wrote that the Colorado coach was being lauded for his “paradigm-shifting, precedent-shattering work” and for his galvanizing effect on the school (applications to Colorado have skyrocketed, particularly from African American students, and the Buffaloes sold out every football game for the first time), the city of Boulder (it’s estimated that Colorado’s first four home games added $77.8 million to the city’s economy) and on college football as a whole (until it was surpassed by last weekend’s Michigan-Ohio State game, the Buffaloes’ Sept. 23 loss to Oregon was the most-watched game of the season on television).As for the actual football Sanders is overseeing? It gets one paragraph near the end of the story, mostly laying out how much Colorado improved over the 2022 season, when the Buffaloes finished 1-11 and were one of the nation’s worst and least-relevant teams.Colorado might not have gotten a whole lot better on the field in 2023, but the Buffaloes certainly are more relevant, and Sanders’s methods — namely telling most of the players from that 2022 season that they were no longer wanted and replacing them with 54 transfers — are likely going to be copied by a sizable number of coaches moving forward, even though Colorado and the nation’s other transfer-dependent programs didn’t fare too well this season.As compiled by ESPN’s Tom VanHaaren, Colorado led the nation this season in percentage of games played by transfers (69.6 percent), followed by Texas State (64 percent by 45 transfers) Charlotte (55.8 percent by 46 transfers), Mississippi (54.5 percent by 27 transfers) and Massachusetts (53.3 by 27 transfers). Those five teams went a combined 27-33. Take out the 10-2 Rebels, and they went 17-31.Conversely, transfers played in only 5 percent of Georgia’s games. The Bulldogs have won 29 straight games and the last two College Football Playoff championships.To be fair to Sports Illustrated, the company still is at least marginally in the business of selling magazines (or their online equivalent), and there is a sizable amount of lead time needed to get those hard-copy issues out. What may have looked like a good decision earlier this fall doesn’t look so great after the Buffaloes fell off the map. Still, SI Editor-in-Chief Stephen Cannella said he and the magazine’s editorial leadership were confident in the pick.“There wasn’t much discussion about changing the pick as Colorado’s season went on,” Cannella said in a statement provided to The Post. “We of course were impressed by the Buffs’ performance early in the season — the entire country was. But our choice and the story we’re telling about Deion is about more than wins and losses. The reasons that he’s our pick hold regardless of their final record.”And it’s not like there were a whole lot of other candidates who stood out, though soccer player Lionel Messi (whose move to MLS — coming off a World Cup title with Argentina — caused quite a stir), women’s college basketball stars Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese (whose duel in the NCAA tournament championship game drew the most television viewers in women’s college basketball history), Spain’s World Cup-winning soccer team and tennis icon Novak Djokovic (who won 3 of 4 men’s tennis Grand Slams) would have been worthy candidates.",4494,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/30/deion-sanders-sports-illustrated-2023-sportsperson-of-the-year/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,ncaa point story company improve host duel grand map effect program post nation artificial loss finish final american review buffalo real forward illustrate coordinator espn great oversee reporter viewer surpass worthy forde lionel economy million entire change student history statement choice bulldog team drew reason time deion woman offensive writer honor skyrocket home game course estimate consumer start bestow decide provide compile accompany intelligence clark football city actual move charlotte impressed pat field sell bylined sizable coach method straight highly djokovic coincide duty messi decision nosedive oregon particularly issue slam san sport fell thursday buff basketball weekend tennis editorial write mississippi texas fall record number offense longer win yard confident left caitlin diego played laud percent fake lay publication rebel boulder replace relevant colorado away country performance school penalty state soccer equivalent fare magazine person discussion spain african early georgia season work percentage massachusetts add job cannella candidate fair respect marginally hold victory online tournament business novak reach fail lewis joke angel paragraph world argentina amount combination sportsperson product lead decline head application tom pick follow sander defense lot commit thrill playoff championship reese player copy vanhaaren earlier combine cup star leadership stir september ml television college title stood galvanize article icon stephen transfer,0.98895,0.0,9.132119815668204,0.5269633099141294,0,2023-11-30

ABC,Roger Penske pumps brakes on NASCAR champ Ryan Blaney's Indy 500 ambitions. Larson to attempt double,2023-11-30 13:41:00,JENNA FRYER AP auto racing writer,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- One NASCAR championship down and Ryan Blaney already has his eyes on another prize.The Indianapolis 500.Roger Penske said Thursday that NASCAR's reigning Cup champion had inquired about someday running “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” but “The Captain” pumped the brakes.“It's interesting to me that Blaney said to me that he'd looked to go to Indy,” Penske said Thursday ahead of Blaney and Team Penske's coronation as Cup champions. “I said we're going to have to slow down a little bit. We're going to have everybody coming to Indy.”Kyle Larson will try to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 this May and become the first driver since Kurt Busch in 2014 to attempt to complete both the Indy 500 and NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 on the same day. Five drivers have attempted it nine times, and only Tony Stewart has completed all 1,100 miles.Blaney's interest in doing the double was revealed Thursday by Penske, who said Larson team owner Rick Hendrick approached Penske about running Larson in the Indy 500. Penske said he declined a partnership because Team Penske had to improve its own three-car Indy 500 effort before taking on another driver.Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 last May for Penske's 19th win in the iconic race; Hendrick took the Larson deal to McLaren, which will field a car for Larson this coming May.Blaney admitted Thursday “I've poked around that idea with RP for a couple of years now, and we'll have to see where that goes” about the Indy 500.“I feel like not many people can do the double. It would be neat to just do it,” Blaney said. “I have respect for all forms of motorsports. So I think you want to go experience something like that. At my age it would be perfect to do it. I think the nostalgia of it, being able to say you ran 1,100 miles on one day on the racetrack, is pretty special.""Blaney turns 30 on Dec. 31.Blaney's interest in Indy was news to Larson, who is deep into his IndyCar immersion. But when it comes to doing the double, Larson wants to see some of the IndyCar drivers try NASCAR.“I would love to see a Josef Newgarden come run the Coke 600,” Larson said. “A lot of the guys come from the NASCAR side do it, so it would be interesting to see the other side of the switch.”___",2246,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/roger-penske-pumps-brakes-nascar-champ-ryan-blaneys-105280587,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,news someday run improve win nashville couple double interest kurt champion race bit attempt guy stewart newgarden pumped larson ahead kyle spectacle great year nostalgia captain josef racetrack iconic feel deal motorsports qualify effort tony turn ryan indy eye age blaney respect team form time admit experience coronation immersion poked inquire rp pretty complete reign penske mclaren side driver decline special love car mile field lot rick championship ran partnership perfect cup slow approach idea coke nascar thursday neat owner deep indycar day busch hendrick indianapolis reveal,0.9944,0.1335707925200356,6.887099567099565,0.4620076425631981,0,2023-11-30

Washington Post,College football best bets: Georgia can stop Alabama’s explosive offense,2023-11-30 11:00:00,Matt Bonesteel,"These picks waited until the very end of the regular season to have a bad week, going a dismal 1-3 last weekend. Still, at 27-21 on the season, we have a chance to close things out on a high note with this weekend’s conference championship games.This column will give out four picks per week: the game of the week, a favorite, an underdog and a wild card, which can be anything (another favorite or underdog in a game that might be flying under the radar or a total, for instance). Hopefully we’ll all be in good shape by the time the clock hits zero at the national championship game in Houston on Jan. 8.All spreads were taken Wednesday from DraftKings Sportsbook. All times Eastern.SEC championship gameNo. 1 Georgia vs. No. 8 Alabama in Atlanta4 p.m. Saturday, CBSThe pick: Georgia -5½Alabama’s offense has been extremely reliant on explosive plays, defined here as passing plays that gain at least 15 yards or running plays that gain at least 10 yards. In last week’s escape-act win over Auburn, 73.7 percent of the Crimson Tide’s total yardage came on explosive plays, and Alabama’s plays that were not considered explosive gained only 2.3 yards per snap. It has been like this all season: In the Crimson Tide’s 34-24 loss to Texas on Sept. 9, Alabama gained 90 percent of its yardage on explosive plays, and its nonexplosive plays gained 0.7 yards on average. Alabama’s offense has accounted for 40 touchdowns, with 24 of them coming on explosive plays (60 percent).Georgia’s defense has been pretty good at limiting such plays. The Bulldogs have allowed just 129 scrimmage plays of at least 10 yards (tied for 11th nationally) and 35 scrimmage plays of at least 20 yards (tied for ninth). Opponents have gained at least 20 yards on running plays only six times (tied for fifth), and Alabama runs the ball a whole lot: 60.2 percent of the time, the 14th-highest percentage in the country. Georgia has allowed just nine explosive-play touchdowns in 11 games against Football Bowl Subdivision opponents, and only two of them have come in the second half of those games. I think the Bulldogs will take Alabama’s best shot early and then exert their will late, getting the cover.Big 12 championship gameNo. 7 Texas vs. No. 18 Oklahoma State in Arlington, Tex.Noon Saturday, ABCThe pick: Texas -15The Cowboys needed a certain amount of luck to even get to the Big 12 title game. Oklahoma State has a 26-point loss to South Alabama — which finished 6-6 — on its résumé, then was fortunate to come away with victories in two of its conference games. In an Oct. 14 win over Kansas, Oklahoma State got the ball in Jayhawks territory on each of its last three drives thanks to an interception and two turnovers on downs, helping to seal the victory. In the Cowboys’ 27-24 upset of Oklahoma on Nov. 4, the Sooners came up scoreless on four drives into Oklahoma State territory, and Oklahoma averaged nearly two yards more per play than the Cowboys. Oklahoma State’s postgame win expectancy in that one was just 37.9 percent. That win gave the Cowboys the tiebreaker over Oklahoma in the Big 12 standings after both finished 7-2 in conference play.Texas not only needs a win to keep its College Football Playoff chances alive, but it also wouldn’t hurt to impress the selection committee while doing so. It also needs someone in the top four of this week’s rankings — namely No. 4 Florida State — to lose and hope Georgia doesn’t lose to Alabama, but that’s out of the Longhorns’ control. What is in Texas’s control is the ability to stop Cowboys running back Ollie Gordon II, the nation’s leading rusher at 131.7 yards per game. The Longhorns rank fifth in rushing yards allowed per game, fifth in rushing yards allowed per carry and seventh in success rate against the run. They gave up 110 rushing yards to Texas Tech last weekend — the first time in six games they gave up triple digits on the ground. But the Red Raiders needed 28 carries to get there, and it’s not like it made much of a difference in Texas’s 57-7 win.Oklahoma State has given up an average of 36.3 points in its past three games to Central Florida, Houston and BYU, and none of those teams scare anyone offensively. Texas ranks eighth in offensive SP+, a measure of efficiency, and I think the Longhorns stroll here.Mid-American Conference championship gameToledo vs. Miami (Ohio) in DetroitNoon Saturday, ESPNThe pick: Miami +8The Rockets and RedHawks met Oct. 21, a 21-17 Toledo win in which Miami quarterback Brett Gabbert suffered a season-ending leg injury. I think the oddsmakers are reading a little too much into that.Miami became a much more run-heavy team in the three games that followed that loss, averaging 40.7 carries. (I’m throwing out last weekend’s 17-15 squeaker over Ball State because the RedHawks had clinched the MAC East title and didn’t have to exert themselves too much.) Running back Rashad Amos did much of the heavy lifting, averaging 7.1 yards per carry and rushing for five touchdowns in those three games. The Rockets are weakest against the run, ranking 84th in rushing defense success rate and 83rd in expected points allowed per carry, and they’ve allowed at least five yards per carry in three of their past four games, with Central Michigan averaging six yards per carry against Toledo this past weekend.Led by quarterback Dequan Finn, the Rockets’ offense comes in averaging 15.3 scrimmage plays of at least 10 yards and 5.3 of at least 20 yards, both of which topped the MAC. But the RedHawks’ defense trailed only Northern Illinois in terms of 10-yard plays allowed by MAC teams, ranking No. 19 nationally in that department. If they can continue to limit big plays and get Amos going on the ground against a susceptible Toledo rushing defense, I think they keep this within a touchdown.Mountain West championship gameBoise State vs. UNLV in Las Vegas3 p.m. Saturday, FoxThe pick: over 59The Broncos and Runnin’ Rebels are mediocre defensively, even though neither has had to play many good offenses. Boise State has taken on just three teams that rank in the top 47 in terms of offensive SP+, giving up 9.31 yards per play to Washington, 8.15 yards per play to Central Florida and 7.11 yards per play to Memphis. UNLV has had to play just one top-47 team in terms of SP+ offense, giving up 8.07 yards per play to Michigan. Last weekend, the Runnin’ Rebels surrendered 37 points and 7.3 yards per play in a loss to San Jose State (No. 48 in SP+ offense).Having a defense that regularly allows big plays is part of the problem for both teams. UNLV’s opponents have gained at least 20 yards on 71 scrimmage plays; only five FBS teams allowed more. Boise State has given up 177 plays of at least 10 yards, which ranks 103rd nationally.",6741,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/30/college-football-betting-sec-championship/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point suffer run expectancy dequan susceptible triple amos spread nation luck interception quarterback defensively regularly eighth shot loss finish south fbs make florida passing scrimmage efficiency difference wait fortunate rush back seal rocket mac instance standing part touchdown kansa cowboy exert close ground ninth espnthe auburn rate late sooner résumé offensively digit hit shape bulldog team draftkings time offensive toledo drive game gameboise big continue define bowl gametoledo football clinched card brett hurt unlv ability lose boise tie abcthe past throw gabbert runnin san rashad gordon measure reading oddsmakers weekend note wednesday texas offense tech conference selection win yard tiebreaker squeaker east red expect detroitnoon upset fly michigan bronco high heavy percent subdivision rebel leg limit stop central column ball radar away country west ollie ranking state seventh explosive scare gameno arlington reliant northern illinois washington early extremely georgia season national percentage finn lift nonexplosive topped dismal jayhawks tide cbsthe foxthe victory carry miami underdog give surrender ohio regular rank nationally committee oklahoma injury zero pretty consider total yardage half opponent raider saturday amount weak lead account jose pick wild follow defense mediocre average play lot houston memphis impress problem playoff championship success term crimson longhorn control trail week chance territory favorite postgame scoreless rusher alive hope department clock college title snap byu stroll sportsbook redhawks top turnover alabama,0.4464,0.3560302625723187,7.775462686567163,0.4224414883362251,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,"The Cardinals, clear-eyed about their failings, aren’t wasting any time",2023-11-30 09:27:00,Chelsea Janes,"Disappointment became something of an epidemic for prominent major league franchises in 2023, so the St. Louis Cardinals, who had not endured a losing season in 15 years, were not alone in entering this offseason spurred by unfamiliar desperation.But as the first month of the offseason turns into the second, the Cardinals have differentiated themselves from similar disappointed powerhouses in a few significant ways. One, they have been clear about what they want. Two, they have been aggressive in trying to get it.“We entered this offseason with one simple goal, and that was pitching, pitching, pitching,” Cardinals team president John Mozeliak said this week at a news conference introducing Sonny Gray, the most decorated of three starting pitchers St. Louis recently signed. “So far, so good.”They say titles are not won in November … at least when the World Series ends in October. Specifics aside, the offseason does not necessarily determine much of anything when it comes to the regular season. None of this might change St. Louis’s 2024 fate at all.But the Cardinals were already taking a different approach to their disappointment as early as August, when other teams were still grappling with what went wrong. Even as they were playing out the last days of the most disappointing regular season of his tenure, Mozeliak and his manager, Oli Marmol, were open about what they felt had gone wrong: Their starting pitching was not good enough to carry them to a division title, let alone deep into October. They thought a rotation full of pitchers who induced weak contact would play well with their elite defense and get enough swings and misses to survive. It didn’t. Their starters finished with the fifth-worst ERA in baseball, and three of them have departed: The Cardinals sent Jack Flaherty, once seen as a future St. Louis ace, to the Baltimore Orioles at the trade deadline; dealt reliable left-hander Jordan Montgomery to the World Series-winning Texas Rangers; and saw Adam Wainwright retire.So the Cardinals entered this offseason desperate for starters and everyone around the sport knew it, which meant they had little leverage in potential trade negotiations and little room to hide from agents who might want to drive their clients’ prices up. Plus, the free agent market for starting pitchers is sparse enough that multiple heads of baseball operations called it one of the more competitive they have ever seen. Executives and agents alike assume top options such as Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto will earn nine-figure deals despite Snell’s propensity to walk batters and Yamamoto’s lack of a track record in MLB. Everyone needed innings, and many of the sport’s biggest spenders have been chasing them.Faced with those circumstances, the Cardinals jumped. They signed two veterans with a history of eating innings, Lance Lynn and Kyle Gibson, to one-year deals with club options for 2025. Neither came close to contending for a Cy Young Award last year. Lynn gave up so many home runs that it became something of an uncomfortable joke, one even the sometimes surly veteran made fun of himself. But since 2013, Gibson is sixth among all starters in innings, and Lynn is eighth. Everyone ahead of Gibson is a future Hall of Famer, Cy Young Award winner or both. At this point in their careers, neither Lynn nor Gibson is an ace, though each was an all-star as recently as 2021. But neither Lynn nor Gibson is a risk, either.“We were hoping to be able to sign a couple pitchers we knew we could count on innings for, then if we were able to accomplish that, we were hoping to do something a little bit bigger, longer,” Mozeliak said. “And obviously that’s where Sonny fits in.”Gray, 34, finished second in voting for the American League Cy Young Award after pitching to a 2.79 ERA in 32 starts for the Minnesota Twins. He is a three-time all-star with a similar history of durability to Gibson and Lynn, sitting 14th on that list of innings thrown since 2013. The Cardinals signed him to a three-year deal, meaning he can anchor their rotation for the foreseeable future, and anchors — rather than headliners — seem to be what Mozeliak and Co. wanted to make sure they got this offseason above all else.“You want to talk about changing a pitching culture or creating and establishing a strong pitching culture, I think bringing in Lance, bringing in Kyle, bringing in me — you want to talk about bringing an edge?” Gray said at his news conference. “Bringing an intent and some fire to the guys taking the ball? You’re definitely doing that.”But while Gray pitched like an ace last year, he hasn’t always profiled as an elite starter. If Snell and Yamamoto were the top names on the market, Gray was a tier below them, a little less coveted because of his age, a little less heralded because he has never won a Cy Young or even been the clear-cut ace of his team’s staff. Pairing him, Gibson and Lynn with fellow veteran Miles Mikolas means the Cardinals will start the season with a far steadier, more predictable bunch than they had last season. But it does not necessarily mean they are ready to reemerge as the de facto favorites in the National League Central, let alone a World Series contender. They do not have a clear fifth starter. They do not, one could argue, have the kind of ace around which championship teams tend to be built — though the Rangers were without their aces for most of this year’s postseason and survived because they stockpiled pitching depth.“There’s still two months left in this offseason. We understand there’s still work to do. The offseason is fluid. We’re going to take our time, reassess where we are,” Mozeliak said. “We’ll certainly see if there are ways we can still improve before we get down to Jupiter.”",5780,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/30/cardinals-mlb-offseason-moves/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point news run lack improve fate batter induced eighth leverage finish montgomery significant bit baltimore surly american make wainwright kyle sign snell epidemic year clear deal flaherty voting john intent predictable turn fun tend definitely close assume recently aggressive change decorate baseball history foreseeable inning sixth cy reassess famer team propensity adam reliable rotation time goal blake walk count edge yoshinobu hop home wrong powerhouse drive enter oriole operation mikolas start agent big pitcher unfamiliar simple call executive pair durability pitch mile november sparse grapple lose client steadier lance october jupiter offseason knew profile facto approach spender chase contender august veteran sport contact fire talk deep endure price competitive open full texas market league record winner free specific gibson meant bring conference ready month longer thrown prominent sonny headliner left couple disappoint manager lynn tenure negotiation tier contend ace uncomfortable award guy central gray track future depart ahead fellow ball herald earn option similar reemerge twin franchise president determine understand series kind strong early season national age potential work built minnesota yamamoto mozeliak jordan felt survive swing cardinal carry ranger despite desperate dealt give young necessarily regular miss risk division room jumped introduce joke list argue world differentiate major weak head different meaning mlb anchor accomplish deadline spur defense play circumstance alike eat championship disappointment career week fluid club establish hide favorite postseason multiple marmol disappointed fit starter jack culture stockpile title day bunch louis create staff trade hall top elite covet,0.9867,0.0519031141868512,8.2282332155477,0.4326148822242573,0,2023-11-30

CNN,Aaron Rodgers returns to practice but he says he’s still unsure whether he can play in a game again this season,2023-11-30 07:59:00,David Close,"Just 11 weeks after new New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers had surgery to repair his torn left Achilles tendon, the soon-to-be 40-year-old has now returned to practice.In September, head coach Robert Saleh said Rodgers would be “out for the year” after the four-time NFL Most Valuable Player was carted off the field after just his fourth snap in the team’s season-opener against the Buffalo Bills.However, in a social media clip posted by the Jets on Wednesday, Rodgers was seen taking practice snaps before throwing the ball.“This isn’t so much getting ready to play as much as it is a progression in his rehab,” Saleh said Wednesday.Before he returned to the practice field, Saleh said that Rodgers could participate in limited activities that included throwing to teammates but would not include any contact: “Aaron is not going to do anything to put himself in harm’s way.”Saleh went onto to praise Rodgers and his dedication to a swift recovery, saying it is a “credit to him.”“I think it’s sooner than everybody did,” Saleh told reporters. “It’s a mentality I think young guys should grasp to. He loves this organization. He wants to be with his teammates. He wants to be here. He’s sacrificed so much already for the organization, himself and his teammates. He’s doing it again. I think it’s a testament to who he is as a human.”News of Rodgers’ seemingly miraculous recovery has social media abuzz, with even NBA superstar LeBron James marveling at the quarterback’s return.“Wow!!! Simply INCREDIBLE!! Back where he belong! A-ROD8,” James exclaimed on X, formerly Twitter.On Tuesday, Rodgers appeared on “The Pat McAfee Show” and told McAfee that he is still not healthy enough to decide on whether he could play again this season.“I’m improving steadily, but I’m not at the ability to play at this point,” Rodgers said.Rodgers, who turns 40 on Saturday, is widely regarded as to be making a remarkable, rapid recovery from his injury.The 19-year veteran quarterback spoke about a possible return in December should the team still have a chance to make the playoffs. According to NFL.com, the Jets have 21-day window to evaluate Rodgers in practice while he remains on the injured reserve list.The 4-7 Jets have six games left in the regular season.If cleared to return, the first game the Super Bowl XLV winner could play in would be against the Washington Commanders on December 24 – the Jets’ third-to-last game of the season.Before being traded in the offseason, Rodgers had spent the first 18 seasons of his NFL career with the Green Bay Packers.Rodgers led the Packets to a Super Bowl XLV win in February 2011 and won MVP awards in 2011, 2014, 2020 and 2021, while setting numerous accuracy records over his future shoe-in Hall of Fame career.",2763,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/sport/aaron-rodgers-nfl-return-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point teammate progression news seemingly ready bay improve win activity left widely post belong social quarterback possible cart torn award dedication guy surgery robert valuable practice swift buffalo mcafee december xlv future make year reporter clear back limited remains lebron medium green incredible york turn include washington season regard credit february sooner spoke told miraculous team healthy testament young put formerly packet game regular james nba clip repair mentality praise decide fourth accord bowl marvel saturday lead reserve love simply head achilles aaron pat rehab return show steadily rodgers field sacrifice ability nfl jet play coach tuesday mvp fame offseason playoff abuzz organization player throw career week chance numerous tendon harm set veteran september recovery contact remarkable spent saleh snap grasp wow injured commander evaluate superstar trade x rapid accuracy wednesday exclaim window hall winner record super participate,0.9953,0.1085776330076004,8.164654545454546,0.3334301115551116,0,2023-11-30

CNN,"England captain Owen Farrell to miss Six Nations after taking break from international rugby, prioritizing mental health",2023-11-30 07:30:00,George Ramsay,"England captain Owen Farrell is taking a break from international rugby “to prioritise his and his family’s mental well-being,” club side Saracens announced on Wednesday.The club said that Farrell will miss next year’s Six Nations but will continue to play for and captain Saracens.The 32-year-old led England to a third-place finish at the Rugby World Cup last month and became his country’s record points scorer during the tournament, passing Jonny Wilkinson’s tally of 1,179.He was also the top scorer at the World Cup with 75 points.“Everyone at England Rugby is fully behind Owen’s decision,” England head coach Steve Borthwick said in a statement.“Since making his debut, he has been an integral part of the England set up for over a decade and the demands on elite athletes are extremely challenging. He is an exemplary player, captain and leader and always gives his all for his country.“It is with typical courage that Owen has made this decision to open up in this manner. Together with all of us at England Rugby, I will do everything I can to ensure that he has the support he requires going forward.”Farrell was banned for the first two games of England’s World Cup campaign having been sent off in a warm-up game for a dangerous tackle. The incident became a flashpoint ahead of the tournament after the red card and a subsequent ban were rescinded and then reinstated.At the time, Farrell’s father, Ireland head coach Andy Farrell, criticized the “absolutely disgusting” response to the disciplinary process from the wider rugby community, while Borthwick criticized the “personal attacks” directed towards the fly-half.During the tournament itself, Farrell commented on online abuse directed at England teammate Tom Curry, saying that it “seems to be going more and more like this.”He told reporters ahead of England’s bronze-medal match against Argentina: “You’re dealing with people. You’re dealing with human beings. Just because you’re saying stuff on your phone or behind a computer screen, it doesn’t make it acceptable. It seems to be going more and more this way, and I don’t think it’s acceptable.”Farrell has arguably been England’s standout player of the past decade, ever since he made his international debut in 2012. He has gone on make 112 appearances for England at fly-half and center and has been the captain of the team since 2019.",2366,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/sport/owen-farrell-six-nations-mental-health-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point teammate screen month leader athlete international steve red manner nation flashpoint computer jonny announce finish demand subsequent phone make ahead center passing country year disgust reporter typical captain deal andy require campaign comment part owen scorer borthwick extremely england acceptable appearance told farrell team time online tournament abuse give ireland arguably wider prioritise game stuff miss ban tally tackle continue family ensure world argentina dangerous fully community courage lead side personal curry head absolutely standout card match tom direct rugby play decade mental coach wilkinson criticize disciplinary past player incident decision rescind cup club set response attack exemplary debut saracen process human support integral open top elite challenge record father break,-0.7535499999999999,0.3803888419273034,8.953752711496747,0.384,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Luke Donald to remain Europe captain for 2025 Ryder Cup,2023-11-30 07:02:00,Ben Church,"Following on from a win at this year’s Ryder Cup, Luke Donald will continue as European captain for the 2025 edition at Bethpage Black in New York.The 45-year-old led his team to a 16.5 - 11.5 win in October to wrestle back the title from the US.He will now become Europe’s first repeat captain since Bernard Gallacher manned the helm in three consecutive tournaments between 1991 and 1995.“I’m delighted and honored to have been given the chance to lead Team Europe in the Ryder Cup once again,” Donald said, per the Ryder Cup.“Great opportunities don’t come along very often in life and I’m a great believer that when they do, you need to grab them with both hands. This is one of these moments.”Donald is a popular captain with both European fans and players, and he’s certainly got a successful history with the Ryder Cup.He won the prestigious tournament on all four of his participations as a player and now once as a captain.The former world No. 1 was part of the last European team to win the Ryder Cup on US soil back in 2012.He will hope to repeat such a feat as captain in two years’ time.“The Ryder Cup means so much to me, so to be captain again and have the chance to create more history by becoming only the second European Captain to win back-to-back is exciting,” Donald added.It’s currently unclear who will be captaining the US team opposite Donald when the 2025 edition tees off at Bethpage Black.There had been murmurs that Tiger Woods could take charge of his country’s team, but the golf icon sounded indifferent when asked about it at a press conference on Tuesday.Woods, who makes his long-awaited comeback to competitive golf on Thursday at the Hero World Challenge, now sits on the PGA Tour policy board and is helping shape the future of the game amid the PGA’s controversial merger with LIV Golf.“Right now, there’s too much at stake with our tour to think about a Ryder Cup right now,” he told reporters.“We have to get this done and we have to be focused on this right now.”",2005,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/sport/luke-donald-europe-captain-ryder-cup-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hero indifferent conference win european opposite sits pga press golf excite board future controversial currently make policy country great year murmur captain back gallacher tee part liv feat popular life sound europe helm history edition wrestle told shape consecutive amid team tournament honor give charge focus bernard participation tour delighted game merger former luke hand continue opportunity world comeback lead black tiger follow prestigious donald october successful player believer cup chance bethpage repeat ryder soil hope unclear title wood thursday create stake competitive challenge icon grab,0.9879,0.1496259351620947,7.689779951100245,0.395934620934621,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,One key thing to know about every Week 13 NFL game,2023-11-30 07:00:00,Cindy Boren,"Through the 12th week of the NFL season, four teams in both the AFC and the NFC have at least eight wins, and the playoff picture is beginning to take shape as the critical month of December is about to begin.The AFC has a logjam, with 12 teams having won at least five games. The Denver Broncos are ascending at a convenient time and are tied with the NFC’s Philadelphia Eagles for the NFL’s longest winning streak at five games, while the Buffalo Bills, a preseason pick by many to make it to the Super Bowl, are headed in the opposite direction.In the NFC, there will be clarity after Sunday’s marquee game between the Eagles and San Francisco 49ers.Here’s a look at the AFC playoff standings through Week 12:1. Ravens2. Chiefs3. Jaguars4. Dolphins5. Steelers6. Browns7. ColtsHere’s how the NFC is shaping up through Week 12:1. Eagles2. 49ers3. Lions4. Falcons5. Cowboys6. Seahawks7. VikingsOverall, six teams are tied for the most victories (four) against opponents who have winning records: Baltimore, Cleveland, Jacksonville and Kansas City in the AFC, and Philadelphia and San Francisco in the NFC.Byes: Bears (4-8), Bills (6-6), Giants (4-8), Raiders (5-7), Ravens (9-3), Vikings (6-6)Here’s a look at some interesting facts entering Week 13.All times Eastern.Seahawks (6-5) at Cowboys (8-3), 8:15 p.m., Arizona Prime: Soon-to-be Girl Dad Dak Prescott has completed 71 percent of his passes with 17 touchdowns and two interceptions in his past five games — only one of which was against a team with a winning record at the time. Dallas’s defense under Dan Quinn has scored 15 touchdowns, one more than the Cowboys had over the eight previous seasons.Chargers (4-7) Patriots (2-9), 1 p.m., CBS: New England allowed 10 points in each of its past two games — and went 0-2. How far has this franchise fallen? With a 4-14 showing over its past 18 games, New England appears to be on to the draft, where it may get a top-five pick for the first time since 1994.Lions (8-3) at Saints (5-6), 1 p.m., Fox: Jared Goff fumbled three times in the Thanksgiving loss to Green Bay and completed only 6 of 16 passes when pressured, according to Next Gen Stats, but still accounted for 332 yards and two touchdowns. Detroit has had 11 turnovers in its past five games and has given up an average of 29 points over that span but has an offense that is second in the NFL in yardage (405.5 per game).Falcons (5-6) at Jets (4-7), 1 p.m., Fox: Tim Boyle will again be at the controls of a Jets offense that has seven passing touchdowns through 11 games. The Jets’ losing streak stands at four, but there’s always the chance that Aaron Rodgers makes an ill-advised return.Cardinals (2-10) at Steelers (7-4), 1 p.m., CBS: For the first time since the second week of the 2020 season, Pittsburgh had more than 400 yards of offense and now faces a string of winnable games. After Arizona, it plays at home against New England, at Indianapolis and at home against Cincinnati and could be 11-4 by Christmas Eve.Colts (6-5) at Titans (4-7), 1 p.m., CBS: Indianapolis scored 27 points in a big win over Tampa Bay, helped in large measure by Coach Shane Steichen deciding to go for it on fourth down four times. The Colts converted three of those gambles and went on to score two touchdowns. Indianapolis has converted 11 of 22 fourth-down attempts and plays just two more teams with a winning record at the moment.Dolphins (8-3) at Commanders (4-8), 1 p.m., Fox: Miami won by double digits in its Black Friday game against the Jets but had three giveaways (two on Tua Tagovailoa interceptions and one on his lost fumble). Miami has had two or more turnovers against the Giants, Chargers, Bills and Patriots (in their second meeting) and didn’t top 20 points against the Bills, Eagles or Chiefs.Broncos (6-5) at Texans (6-5), 1 p.m., CBS: Houston rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud passed for 304 yards against Jacksonville, moving past Justin Herbert for the most passing yards by a rookie in his first 11 games (3,266 to Herbert’s 3,224). He’ll face a suddenly stout Denver defense that, after giving up 70 points in Week 3, has allowed 80 over its past five games.Panthers (1-10) at Buccaneers (4-7), 4:05 p.m., CBS: Tampa Bay is only one game back in the NFC South, where three of the four teams are in playoff contention because the division is awful. The fourth team, Carolina, is assured of a sixth straight losing season since David Tepper purchased it in 2018.Browns (7-4) at Rams (5-6), 4:25 p.m., Fox: Kyren Williams, the Rams’ second-year running back, returned after missing four games with an ankle injury and became the first player in NFL history with 140 or more rushing yards, six or more receptions, 60 or more receiving yards and two or more touchdown receptions in a game. His team occupies the ninth spot in the NFC playoff picture.49ers (8-3) at Eagles (10-1), 4:25 p.m., Fox: This NFC championship game rematch is the first of two games in which the Eagles’ opponent is coming off extra rest created by playing on Thursday. In three games since acquiring defensive end Chase Young before their bye, the 49ers have 15 sacks, with at least four in each of those games.Chiefs (8-3) at Packers (5-6), 8:20 p.m., NBC: Green Bay has won three of its past four games and is only one spot out of the NFC playoff picture.

CNN,Mystery still swirls around LSU forward Angel Reese’s absence as star is set to play high-profile game Thursday,2023-11-30 06:18:00,David Close,"LSU women’s basketball head coach Kim Mulkey said star player Angel Reese will return to the defending national champion’s lineup on Thursday against No. 9 Virginia Tech.Reese has been mysteriously absent from the team since the Tigers faced Kent State on November 14.Even before sitting down for her scheduled Wednesday press conference, Mulkey boasted:Mulkey did not explain why the seventh-ranked Tigers’ marquee forward hasn’t even made the bench for LSU’s last four games. Reese didn’t travel with the team this past week for a high profile, two-game set against Niagara and Virginia at the Cayman Island Classic.“She’s coming back after not being with the team,” Mulkey said. “We’ve moved on.”On the court, Reese is one of the best players in the country.She was named the 2023 Final Four Most Outstanding Player after the Tigers beat Iowa 102-85 in April’s NCAA national championship game. The first team All-American averaged 23 points and 15.4 rebounds last season.Off the court, Reese is one of the most popular athletes in the country with over three million followers on Instagram, X and YouTube.As speculation flooded social media as to why the superstar was not with the team, Reese posted on X, formerly Twitter, on November 19: “Please don’t believe everything you read.”When asked if Reese was going to play against the Hokies with just one or even no practices before tip-off, Mulkey said, “Angel is available to play tomorrow. But if you want to know, Angel has been practicing.“Do you wanna know how many hours? How many days? Specifics? She is not going to show up tomorrow and play a game.”Mulkey said she didn’t expect Reese to be rusty in her return.“I really think Angel will just be like Angel. I mean she has just been good, really good in practice.”The head coach was repeatedly asked about Reese’s high-profile, two-game set absence.Mulkey told the gathered media that there was a “sacredness” to a locker room. “What’s in that locker room stays in that locker room,” she said.“Angel is back and we are happy, happy, happy.

CNN,Manchester United on the brink of an early Champions League exit after chaotic draw against Galatasaray,2023-11-30 05:48:00,Matias Grez,"Manchester United is on the brink of an early Champions League exit after twice throwing away a two-goal lead in a chaotic 3-3 draw with Galatasaray.Erik ten Hag’s side started the match well, clearly unperturbed by the famously hostile atmosphere inside Istanbul’s RAMS Park, and took the lead through Alejandro Garnacho after only 11 minutes following a wonderful flowing move.Captain Bruno Fernandes doubled United’s lead with stunning long-range strike just seven minutes later, before Hakim Ziyech’s free-kick wrong-footed Andre Onana and halved the deficit after half an hour.Scott McTominay restored United’s two-goal lead just 10 minutes into the second half after a swift United counterattack, but Onana’s nightmare for his new club continued as the Cameroon international inexplicably diverted Ziyech’s cross into his own net to make it 3-2.The goal galvanized the players and the home crowd as Galatasaray went in search of an equalizer.They didn’t have to wait long as substitute Muhammed Kerem Aktürkoğlu fired a blistering strike past Onana to draw his side level less than 10 minutes later.Both teams had plenty of chances to win the match in the final 20 minutes but, in the end, had to settle for a share of the spoils.After the match, ten Hag said he was happy with the team’s performance but lamented another night of errors that cost his team dearly.“We should have taken three points,” the Dutchman told TNT Sports after the game. “But also like in other games, home against Galatasaray and away in Copenhagen, we played so good, so I have to give a big compliment to the team.United has now conceded 14 goals in just five Champions League group matches, the most by an English club after five games in the competition’s history, according to Opta.United is now bottom of Group A on four points, with Copenhagen and Galatasaray one point ahead in second and third place respectively. Bayern had already qualified for the knockout stages ahead of the team’s 0-0 draw with Copenhagen on Tuesday.While United’s form in the Premier League has improved, winning five of its last six matches to climb to sixth in the table, the team’s performances have remained largely turgid and uninspiring.The 3-0 home defeat to Manchester City only served to hammer home just how far away United currently is from competing with the top teams in England and Europe, despite spending vast sums on player transfers.The team was also emphatically dumped out of the League Cup by Newcastle after another 3-0 home defeat, leaving the FA Cup as the only realistic chance of silverware for the Red Devils this season.The team’s only chance of reaching the Champions League knockout stages is to beat Bayern Munich at Old Trafford in the final group game and hope that Copenhagen and Galatasaray draw.",2796,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/sport/manchester-united-champions-league-galatasaray-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,aktürkoğlu point inexplicably stage table munich strike deficit international win improve red leave compliment divert cross double played night draw champion alejandro bruno hag bayern united final swift cost silverware inside mctominay restore halve currently make ahead away climb performance tnt wait respectively level lament hostile vast dumped settle nightmare qualify place ziyech counterattack substitute plenty happy early minute compete galatasaray england blistering bottom sum europe history told sixth atmosphere serve copenhagen beat team form remain fernandes kerem largely goal despite give competition manchester home muhammed spending flow game reach wonderful crowd knockout cameroon onana start long big accord half emphatically trafford dutchman lead side city share turgid ten net match istanbul ram stun andre follow realistic past player throw chaotic cup club chance devil group exit unperturbed search defeat hope continued sport famously garnacho error fire newcastle english galvanize brink concede park hammer top premier hakim league,0.9497,0.1072961373390558,10.813567251461986,0.443703065641841,0,2023-11-30

Chicago Tribune,Mount Carmel High School celebrates 15th football state championship,2023-11-29 17:50:00,Hank Sanders,"Mount Carmel High School celebrated Wednesday the school’s 35-10 victory Saturday over Downers Grove North to claim the state title in Class 7A football.This is title number 15 for the Mount Carmel Caravan football program and the second in two years. School leaders spoke about the sacrifices made by the athletes and their families during the rally at the all-boys Catholic school in Chicago’s Woodlawn neighborhood.“We spent more time with your kids than you guys do yourselves,” head coach Jordan Lynch said as he looked at the parents in the front row. “We demand a lot from your kids. Thank you guys for sending your sons here to Mount Carmel.”Mount Carmel’s success came in large part due to the efforts of junior Darrion Dupree, a four-star running back who has committed to play football at the University of Wisconsin—Madison.The football team lost once in the last 28 games, which is tied for a school best over the course of two complete seasons. As the one loss record from this season was referenced, several of the players shook their head in frustration as they recalled dropping a game to Loyola Academy.“We have the best coaches in the state of Illinois, even the country,” said Lynch, a Mount Carmel alumnus, Heisman Trophy finalist and Chicago Bear. “I’d take this group over everyone.”Also in attendance was 5th Ward Ald. Desmon Yancy, who represents Mount Carmel and the neighboring community.“They’ve figured out something around success. I’d love to be able to replicate and support,” said Yancy, who was elected this year and is an alumnae of Kenwood Academy High School in Kenwood, just north of Woodlawn.“We’ve got another high school just a couple blocks away that looks very, very different from Mount Carmel,” she said in reference to Hyde Park High School. “So if there is a way to be able to share resources ... I think we got a great opportunity to do that here.”Mount Carmel Principal Scott Tabernacki reminded students on and off the team about the hard work and determination that brought the students the trophy they held as the pep rally drums commenced.“All those days in the summer, in the heat, having to get up at 5 a.m., that’s the work,” Tabernacki said. “That has to continue. That’s also what you need to be as proud about as ... you are about that trophy.”hsanders@chicagotribune.com",2330,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-sta-mount-carmel-championship-pep-rally-st-1130-20231129-wuyawggig5dezevjpqxeol3mg4-story.html,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,run leader alumna athlete darrion couple program class high elect dupree loss guy demand brought determination rally make away country grove great year shook parent school back state finalist hard large effort lynch part resource yancy represent block illinois send catholic front season work trophy north frustration hsanders student figure spoke jordan kid alumnus academy team junior kenwood woodlawn hyde heisman victory time recall due reference row remind game course chicago downer ald complete continue opportunity family saturday football celebrate desmon tabernacki share love head different pep sacrifice loyola claim lose carmel play lot coach proud commit replicate tie scott summer success player attendance ward held principal neighbor bear caravan group drop mount spent title heat day support park wednesday drum record number university,0.97525,0.0,7.727420042643921,0.4000705467372133,0,2023-11-29
Chicago Tribune,Construction companies fined in connection with worker’s death at Green Bay Packers’ Lambeau Field,2023-11-29 16:35:00,not specified,"Federal labor inspectors have levied fines against two construction companies in connection with a worker’s death at Lambeau Field, home of the Green Bay Packers, earlier this year.Joshua Shaw, a 27-year-old carpenter with Mavid Construction, died in June after he was struck by a dumbwaiter car while working inside one of the football stadium’s video scoreboards, WLUK-TV reported Tuesday. The work was part of a project to replace the stadium’s two video scoreboards and renovate concession stands.WLUK reported that it obtained documents that show the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued citations against Mavid and the project’s general contractor, Miron Construction on Nov. 15. The citations call for fines of more than $15,000 against Mavid and almost $19,000 against Miron.According to OSHA, the companies’ employees and subcontractors were exposed to “pinch-point hazards” associated with the dumbwaiter and didn’t ensure employees and contractors were qualified to operate the device.The companies have time to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA officials or contest the findings.Mavid is working to set up a scholarship in Shaw’s name, the company said in a statement. It said the company has been in communication with OSHA and is committed to workplace safety. Miron officials also said that they are working with officials and are committed to safety.",1424,https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/green-bay-packers-stadium-20231129-5gmo76jumvcuzbl2grsyphbt3u-story.html,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lambeau home conference bay fine company general project administration carpenter ensure football call health comply inside worker show replace contractor connection obtain video car report renovate occupational field associate scoreboard safety green tuesday commit qualify struck construction inspector part labor concession earlier issue work june expose set employee official operate contest document request department levy statement communication informal packer federal subcontractor citation shaw mavid osha dumbwaiter hazard stadium time miron scholarship workplace death,0.42955,0.2106741573033708,12.291935483870963,0.45,0,2023-11-29
USA TODAY,Deion Sanders' three biggest mistakes and accomplishments in first year at Colorado,2023-11-29 11:10:23,Brent Schrotenboer,"Eternal optimist Deion Sanders seems to say stuff like this all the time: ""We’re really going to be good."" ""We’re gonna win. We’re gonna win. We’re gonna win."" ""You gonna be pleased with what’s coming. I promise you that."" He talked that way before the season, after he was hired to coach a Colorado football program that finished 1-11 in 2022. Then he talked that way after the season, when his team lost six consecutive games to finish 4-8. So why should we believe him now? Here are his three biggest failures and successes in 2023 − and how they show he may be right, or wrong, about being on the verge of a breakthrough in 2024: Deion Sanders and his staff overlooked the maintenance of this position, one way or another – through recruiting or retention during their massive roster overhaul before the season. Five offensive linemen from last year left the team after the April spring game, including Jake Wiley, who went to UCLA, and Jackson Anderson, who transferred to Texas-San Antonio. Wouldn’t some of those players have come in handy this season for Colorado, which ranked second nationally in quarterback sacks allowed with 56? Last year, the Buffaloes only allowed 23 sacks during a 1-11 season. This season, the lack of protection from the line ended up costing the health of quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who ended the season with a fracture in his back. Last week, on his Colorado Coaches Football Show, Sanders acknowledged “we built it differently” by bringing in skill position players without as much focus on linemen on the inside. He also said it’s being fixed. ""We built from the outside-in,"" he said. ""So the skill positions were established. Now the internal (line) is gonna be established. Because we already had the skill and we got skill coming from everywhere trying to get in now. You’ve got the phones jumping off the hook for the bigs (linemen) because they see a lack thereof. Therefore, you’ve got a multitude of bigs … who want to block for Shedeur."" Sometimes a loss is so bad it can alter the trajectory of a season. At halftime of this game on Oct. 13, the Buffs were 4-2 and leading at home 29-0. Then after losing this game in double-overtime, 46-43, the Buffs never won again. Deion Sanders admitted he sensed “complacency” in his team at halftime. So why didn’t he do more about it? Anything to stop the bleeding could have avoided it: more aggressive play-calling on offense, a trick play to shift momentum, a key stop on defense. It’s up to Sanders to help facilitate that so the roof doesn’t keep caving in a game like this. If the Buffs had survived this one, they could have built momentum toward the minimum six wins required to become eligible for a postseason bowl berth. It could have changed the whole narrative of this season’s obituary. Colorado lost five games by seven points or fewer. How many would the Buffs have won without so many unforced errors? Many of these mistakes relate to discipline and management, which all goes back to coaching. The Buffs ranked second nationally with 107 penalties committed, behind only New Mexico (4-8), which rang up 119 penalties. One coaching blunder against Oregon State Nov. 4 ended up being the difference in the game. Down 7-3 with 49 seconds left before halftime, the Buffs got the ball on their own 4-yard line. If the Buffs had run the ball and run out the clock, that would have been the score at halftime. Instead, they got cute despite failing to move the ball all game before that. They attempted passes that fell incomplete on first and second down, stopping the clock and giving Oregon State just enough time to get the ball back to extend its lead to 14-3 with a touchdown right before halftime. Deion Sanders blamed himself for the gaffe. Colorado lost, 26-19. Another head-scratcher came in their final game last week at Utah, when the Buffs lost 23-17. Utah got the ball with 7:25 left in the game and then ran out the clock with a 12-play possession that ended on the Colorado 31-yard line as time expired. In other words, the Utes milked the clock for half a quarter by practically sitting on the ball to keep the Buffs from getting another chance to win at the end. How is that even possible? One reason is the questionable use of timeouts. Colorado had burned two of its three timeouts in the third quarter, including one with less than two minutes after halftime. Sanders said he used one to avoid a five-yard penalty. It was described as the biggest story in sports after the Buffs started 3-0 in front of sellout crowds and national television audiences on Fox and ESPN. This was a credit to Sanders’ coaching ability – getting his players to believe they had it in them to beat TCU in the season opener and then carry it over two more games after that, against Nebraska and Colorado State. But they couldn’t sustain that belief, apparently. It almost seemed like the fire burned too hot, too soon and then burned out. Why? Sanders said it was because they lost the necessary “attitude.” Last week, Sanders still promised to get back the magic. Next year, the Buffs’ first three games are at home against North Dakota State Aug. 31, then at Nebraska Sept. 7 and at Colorado State Sept. 14. They then play in the Big 12 Conference after leaving the Pac-12, where they went 1-8 in 2023. ""The climax we gave you early on, we gonna get you back there because I know you liked that ride, didn’t you?"" he said. ""We gonna get you back there."" Shedeur Sanders, son of the coach, was the best quarterback at Colorado since Kordell Stewart in 1994. Two-way star Travis Hunter was the best all-around player in Boulder since the 1930s, when Byron “Whizzer” White played offense, defense and kicker. Both are set to return in 2024, along with Colorado’s best talent in the defensive backfield since the Buffs won two Jim Thorpe Awards for the nation’s best defensive backs in 1992 and 1994. The depth chart there includes Hunter, safety Shilo Sanders (another son of the coach) and Cormani McClain, the No. 1 cornerback recruit in 2023. What happens next year after a year of improvement, better blocking and a better supporting cast? The Buffs only had 11 scholarship players who were in their final year of eligibility in 2023 out of a scholarship limit of 85. The transfer portal heats up again Dec. 4, and Sanders plans to target a “plethora” of players from it. Critics have taken jabs at Deion Sanders for his habit of being followed around by video cameras and fanning the flames of hype. Let’s be honest about that, though. Those critics are jealous. Sanders is a marketing tour de force made for the age of YouTube and social media. The advertising value of the attention the Buffs received after hiring Sanders last year through their first four games of 2023 was $249 million more than the same period a year earlier, according to Cision, the university’s media-monitoring service. What coach wouldn’t want that? A spotlight that bright helps attract recruits, sell tickets and move merchandise. The Buffs sold out every home game this year for the first time ever and played in front of sellout crowds in 11 of their 12 games. On television, the Buffs entered their final game of the season as the most-watched team in America with 54.3 million viewers, not counting games on the Pac-12 Network, where the viewership wasn’t reported. According to Sanders, now it’s just a matter of using that spotlight to go shopping for players and bring home the ingredients the team needs. ""We right on schedule with the plan,"" he said last week. ""The plan is improve every dern thing we touch. Did we sell out every game? Did this team get better? Is hope instilled? What’s the problem? Somebody tell me what’s the problem."" Follow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

ABC,Luke Donald to return as European captain for 2025 Ryder Cup,2023-11-29 08:19:00,MARK SCHLABACH,"Donald will be the European team's first repeat captain since Bernard Gallacher did so in three straight matches from 1991 to 1995.""Great opportunities don't come along very often in life and I'm a great believer that when they do, you need to grab them with both hands -- this is one of these moments,"" Donald said in a statement. ""I've been fortunate as a player to have had many amazing times in the Ryder Cup over the years and so to add being a winning captain to that, to form bonds with the 12 players like we did in Italy and to get the result we did, was very special indeed.""Donald, a former world No. 1 golfer, guided the Europeans to a 16½-11½ victory at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club. The Englishman had replaced Sweden's Henrik Stenson, who was stripped of his captaincy in July 2022 after joining LIV Golf.When Donald was asked about returning as the European team captain at a postmatch news conference at Marco Simone, he said, ""I haven't been asked yet.""European star Rory McIlroy quickly added, ""I think everyone sitting here would be very happy to have him again.""U.S. team captain Zach Johnson is not expected to return to his role in 2025. There is speculation that 15-time major champion Tiger Woods is in line to replace him, but Woods was noncommittal when asked about the possibility at the Hero World Challenge on Tuesday.Woods, who recently joined the PGA Tour policy board, said he was too busy to think about the next Ryder Cup, which is scheduled for Sept. 26-28, 2025.

CNN,‘To see that people really hate us just because of the color of our skin’: Why Juventus duo are talking about mental health,2023-11-29 08:10:00,Matias Grez,"“It was definitely heartbreaking to see,” American soccer star Timothy Weah says of a moment which, even 10 years on, he can still clearly recall.In January 2013, Ghanaian forward Kevin-Prince Boateng led his AC Milan teammates in walking off the pitch during a friendly match after he was racially abused by opposition fans.As a 12-year-old, it was the first time Weah – son of legendary Liberian soccer great George Weah – had seen racism in sport.“I think that was a moment that really … shook me as a young man,” the 23-year-old Weah tells CNN Senior Sport Analyst Darren Lewis. “To see that people really hate us just because of the color of our skin. I feel like he did the right thing walking off the field.“I feel like, if we’re in a situation like that, there’s no need to play. If we’re not accepted here, there’s no need to play. Period.”The idea of players walking off the pitch if they’ve been racially abused is still being talked about, and racial abuse is one of the many ways the mental health of young players is being impacted, Weah and Juventus teammate Samuel Iling-Junior say.As well as talking to CNN Sport, the pair – two of Europe’s most promising young players – discuss mental health and the support offered to players on Juventus’ “Stories of Strength” podcast and insist that being open about feelings and emotions is the best way for players to deal with any difficulties they are experiencing.While there is a club therapist to talk to, they also say they can share their thoughts with teammates.“I see these guys every day,” Weah says. “I’m with Sam every day, so he’s someone that I can definitely confide in and speak to in a personal way.“It [the podcast] was a great experience. Now that I’m getting older, I just feel like it’s very important to get your feelings out and express how you feel in order to continue moving forward.”While conversations around mental health have increased over the years, some stigmas remain; that admitting vulnerability or seeking help is a sign of weakness, perhaps because the soccer industry is so competitive.Weah says that his family is “super in tune with their feelings and their emotions,” but he understands that there still needs to be more discussions around mental health.“My mom made it really easy for me to express how I felt. The communication in my household was amazing,” he says.“It was always good, but I felt like it’s definitely something that needs to be worked on in our community, especially as Africans.“I feel like we don’t see our parents, especially our fathers, express how they feel a lot, so it’s definitely something I think we can work on,” adds Weah, talking more generally about Black male masculinity.Iling-Junior, too, says he comes from a family where being open and honest about your emotions was encouraged and supported.“I’ve always been really lucky that from my background and my culture we’ve always found it quite easy to talk to each other,” the 20-year-old Illing-Junior tells CNN Sport.Weah and Iling-Junior agree that not spending much time with family is one of the most difficult challenges young soccer players face, especially those who move abroad, as they both did.Despite coming from close-knit families, both players said they sometimes struggled to adapt after leaving home.Weah, who plays for the US Men’s National Team and moved abroad to Paris Saint-Germain in 2014 when he was just 14, says he was absent from some of his younger cousins’ landmark moments.“They’re all grown up now and I’ve missed everything. Family time, family reunions, birthdays,” adds Weah.“You kind of just feel distant from everything. And I think that’s really the big thing. But, in general, I think me and Sam know that there’s a bigger goal and we’re just fighting every day for our families. And I think that’s the beautiful thing that’s in it.”Iling-Junior came through Chelsea’s youth ranks but left his London home for Turin, Italy when he signed with Juventus in 2020. He says “constantly playing” makes it difficult for players to see their families.“I came away from home; I’m a London boy and I’m in Turin. So I look to see my family as much as possible. We try and find a routine to make that work,” he says.Weah stresses that while soccer players are seen as heroes and idols by many, it’s important to remember that they’re “just human.”The American says that the perception of a “beautiful lifestyle” or a “beautiful car” doesn’t necessarily equate to happiness.“When you really get to know a lot of the players, you might find out some interesting stuff about them,” Weah says. “Everyone has their own separate lives. We all live a different life. Everyone has their own needs.“And I think, in mental health, that’s important to understand because I think there’s going to be a time where a lot more footballers are going to come and speak out about their mental health.“Obviously, people when they see us, they see the money’s good, the lifestyle is good, but for some of us we don’t value the money as the most important aspect of our lives.”",5067,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/sport/juventus-timothy-weah-samuel-iling-junior-mental-health-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story hero lucky express leave racially friendly separate moment possible idol color health american make reunion sign forward important great year opposition feel deal milan industry stigma routine order analyst definitely mom timothy europe strength grown landmark team remain time goal walk especially george insist admit youth london home equate cnn chelsea find male big birthday continue ghanaian samuel family community personal move share pair match pitch impact generally italy discus easy stress mental amaze darren perception legendary confide encourage hate sport sam idea boateng feeling talk found weakness open challenge father abroad teammate vulnerability paris money juventus left racial liberian seek difficult interest guy promising away shook household parent skin soccer therapist understand kind discussion struggle offer turin national work life heartbreaking add weah accepted racism conversation communication felt difficulty podcast beautiful agree young abuse necessarily live experience spending general honest background rank stuff miss boy lewis cousin distant remember lead january different car black aspect adapt understands play lot lifestyle footballer senior emotion player club ac value star absent constantly culture fight increase day support speak situation super,0.99225,0.0592066311426879,6.8624554826616695,0.5464005602240898,0,2023-11-29
CNN,Soccer set to trial sin bins for dissent and ‘tactical offences’,2023-11-29 08:04:00,George Ramsay,"Soccer is set to trial sin bins at the higher levels of the game in a bid to improve player behavior towards match officials – a move that has drawn a mixed response.The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the sport’s lawmaking body, announced on Monday that sin bins should be trialed “for dissent and specific tactical offences” having been successfully implemented at a grassroots level.Unlike a red card, this would see player leave the pitch for a set period of time and return to the match later on, similar to the 10-minute sin bin successfully introduced to rugby more than 20 years ago.As part of further measures aimed at improving player conduct, the IFAB also supported a proposed trial for only team captains to approach the referee “in certain major game situations.”Speaking at the IFAB’s Annual Business Meeting in London, former referee Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of global governing body FIFA’s referees committee, said: “The trial was very successful in grassroot competitions. We are now talking of bringing it to a higher level.“That was a great experience, but an experience with kids. Now, we are talking of a higher level – very probably professional, or even high professional football.”The announcement has been supported by Ref Support UK, a charity representing the interests of match officials, which called the changes “positive.”It added: “This is a major positive step forward in addressing poor behaviour in our game. Well done to all involved.”Meanwhile, former England and Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, now a pundit for Sky Sports, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: “I’ve never been a fan of sin bins before, but we are watching too many games that have cards & for me it ruins the game … Totally for only allowing the captain to talk to the referee, I do know that’s very hypocritical coming from me!!”But not everyone is in favor of sin bins. Former Chelsea captain John Terry wrote on X: “I personally don’t like it because the level of tolerance and inconsistencies from referees will differ every week.”Terry added that he could see teams becoming more defensive after being reduced to 10 men, making a match less entertaining as a result.Others pointed to the fact that, given the controversy around handball and video assistant referee (VAR) decisions, the sport would only be adding another layer of complexity to its laws with the introduction of sin bins.“Considering football can’t decide what is clear and obvious from one week to the next, sin bins and the threshold for being banished to one have no chance,” CNN Senior Sports Analyst Darren Lewis wrote on X.Speaking at Monday’s IFAB meeting, Mark Bullingham, the chief executive of the English Football Association, explained how sin bins would be awarded for “a foul that prevents a promising attack” when a player “does it consciously knowing that they’re going to get a yellow card,” as well as for dissent.He continued: “The success of sin bins in the grassroots game has been prevention, rather than cure. You get to a point where players know the threat of sin bins and therefore don’t transgress.”The IFAB said that any proposed changes to soccer’s laws will be considered for approval on March 2 next year, and those that are approved will be incorporated into the laws from July 1.",3311,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/sport/soccers-sin-bin-trial-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,liverpool point international improve pierluigi threat leave announce yellow make forward great year cure level clear grassroot grassroots john assistant part personally represent analyst trialed reduce hypocritical collina change announcement prevents team ref incorporate consciously time competition formerly implement ruin bid propose london game cnn chelsea prevention decide behavior entertain pundit football call address executive move threshold foul card match pitch darren successful aim decision probably terry approach controversy set monday meeting sport association attack continued measure talk tactical approve english write x specific bring banish mixed red defensive dissent high drawn interest award board promising chairman similar captain soccer handball global differ england step add introduction official tolerance period mark layer inconsistency kid conduct complexity annual totally give business bullingham experience sky lawmaking approval former committee lewis introduce consider successfully charity poor july twitter defender major obvious positive return video law rugby success carragher senior player fifa week offence favor chance uk trial chief body explain govern fact professional ifab march support speak jamie behaviour referee watch,0.89455,0.0906070673512534,8.922835130970721,0.3908304853041694,0,2023-11-29
CNN,Elite women’s sports tipped to generate over $1.2 billion next year,2023-11-29 07:20:00,Ben Church,"Elite women’s sports will generate revenue of $1.28 billion in 2024, according to financial analysts Deloitte, up 300% from three years ago.The predictions are based on three main revenue streams – matchday, broadcast and commercial – and forecast that soccer and basketball will be the two most valuable sports, bringing in $555 million and $354 million respectively next year.“Over the last few years, we have seen exceptional growth in women’s sport across the globe, driving a significant uplift in its commercial value, which in turn has led to growing interest from investors,” Jennifer Haskel, insights lead for Deloitte’s Sports Business Group, said.“Crucially, women’s sport is increasingly being viewed as a unique product that is becoming ever more distinct from men’s elite sport.”The forecast comes at an exciting time for women’s sports, which have generally been on an upward trajectory in recent years.The FIFA Women’s World Cup, for example, was a roaring success which brought soccer to a whole new audience.However, such tournaments have also shone a light on where improvements are needed, and where women still face discrimination in sports.Spain’s World Cup win, for example, was overshadowed by the unwanted kiss controversy involving former Spanish soccer federation boss Luis Rubiales and Jennifer Hermoso, which triggered a crisis in Spanish soccer and sparked condemnation in Spain and across the world.Deloitte’s predictions forecast that valuations of women’s teams and leagues will continue to rise, with broadcast deals becoming increasingly lucrative.And, while women’s sports in Europe continue to reach new levels, North America is predicted to remain by far the most valuable geographical market. Deloitte predicts the region will bring in $670 million next year, 52% of the market.“Broadcasters, streamers and social media platforms will have an important role to play in showcasing major events that capture the interest of new and existing fans, while creating an experience that is memorable and impactful,” Paul Lee, global head of technology, media and telecoms research at Deloitte, said.“The next step will be maintaining habitual viewers who loyally tune in to watch their favorite players, teams and competitions across the season.”",2277,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/sport/elite-womens-sport-deloitte-revenue-spti-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bring insight discrimination loyally condemnation predict win billion america habitual federation region growth social technology interest excite significant valuable brought hermoso forecast increasingly impactful role investor rise spark important year broadcast respectively level prediction viewer deal soccer medium rubiales deloitte turn global analyst spain bos haskel season platform base step north million uplift trajectory europe predicts broadcaster research shone generate team commercial remain unique woman time tournament maintain competition business experience roar lee drive jennifer reach former exist paul accord involve trigger continue distinct overshadow improvement matchday world financial unwanted major product lead light head luis generally showcasing play memorable success grow player fifa telecom cup value exceptional favorite controversy kiss event group capture spanish sport globe recent crucially basketball revenue upward crisis create view valuation elite market streamer league geographical stream watch,0.9873,0.1317523056653491,11.249856459330145,0.4436252771618625,0,2023-11-29
CNN,"After firing third coach in four years, Carolina Panthers owner wants next coach to be able to eulogize him",2023-11-29 06:16:00,Ben Morse,"David Tepper’s time as the owner of the Carolina Panthers hasn’t been wrought with much success.Since taking the reins in 2018, the team has had a 30-63 record and has missed the playoffs every season.And on Monday, Tepper fired his third head coach in his five years in charge, with Frank Reich being let go after a 1-10 start in his first year at the helm.Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Tepper rejected the notion that his impatience has led to the carousel of coaches which in turn has resulted in a feeling of uncertainty within the organization.“I do have patience,” Tepper told reporters. “My reputation away from this game is one of extreme patience. There’s no reason why that doesn’t come here, too – it does.“Now, that patience comes with good performance and things that you want to see. Progress being made in different aspects. As I said, I would like to have somebody here for 20, 30 years. I would like to have somebody that would say a eulogy at my funeral.”The team’s record since he replaced former Panthers owner Jerry Richardson in 2018 is the second worst in the NFL in that span.Tepper said that the shifting sands within the franchise wouldn’t hamper his ability to find the perfect long-term appointment.“Look, things are constantly evolving, and they’ll continue to evolve,” he said. “Try to make things better is what you always try to do.“Obviously, that record is not good enough. There’s no hiding it. It is what it is like everything in this sport. Everything is left on the field. Everybody knows what it is every week. That record is that record. Like I said, it is not good enough. We’re going to self-reflect to make it better.”A key factor in Reich’s firing was the inability to provide a platform for the 2023 NFL Draft’s No. 1 overall pick, Bryce Young, to have success in his rookie season.The former Alabama star has struggled since he arrived in Carolina, with the Panthers slumping to a league-worst record through Week 12.In his first 10 NFL starts, the 22-year-old quarterback is completing 61.7% of his passes for 1,877 yards with nine touchdowns and eight interceptions.What makes Young’s struggles even more stark is the success of the No. 2 pick in this year’s draft, CJ Stroud, with the Houston Texans. Stroud has had a historic start to his rookie season, setting records for passing in his debut campaign, with Houston in place to make a playoff run in his first year in the NFL.When asked by reporters whether the organization has any regrets over choosing Young over Stroud, Tepper said they were “totally confident in that pick.”“Now, it’s been reported, and we’ve talked about it, originally, we were going to go with the No. 2 pick, and we thought we’d get CJ because we thought the Texans were going to pick Bryce,” Tepper said. “Listen, we preferred Bryce. He was our No. 1 pick.”",2840,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/sport/carolina-panthers-david-tepper-next-coach-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,cj run yard confident left pass listen sand wrought impatience quarterback draft notion make replace slump away passing tepper year carousel reporter performance arrive regret reject feel result medium reich rein place campaign originally franchise turn touchdown struggle season extreme platform stark frank reputation told choose team reason rookie time totally young charge factor game panther former evolve miss find inability start complete continue provide texan lead head uncertainty different richardson report field hiding aspect ability pick nfl coach tuesday houston playoff success organization patience perfect progress week carolina jerry stroud star eulogy constantly set monday prefer david shift sport historic key hamper debut owner fire talk record alabama bryce,-0.31095,0.0,6.174399999999999,0.4143518518518518,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,"Even in lost season, Aaron Rodgers isn’t ready to abandon comeback bid",2023-11-29 06:00:00,Mark Maske,"Prudence dictates that any notion of quarterback Aaron Rodgers playing for the New York Jets again this season should be abandoned soon.The Jets are 4-7. They are 15th in the AFC, ahead of only the New England Patriots. They are two games out of the conference’s seventh and final playoff spot. They have less than a 1 percent chance to reach the postseason, according to the New York Times’s NFL playoff simulator.Rodgers is not entirely abandoning his bid, however, to return late this season from the torn Achilles’ tendon in his left leg that he suffered four offensive snaps into the Jets’ opener.“Once I’m healthy,” Rodgers said Tuesday on “The Pat McAfee Show,” “and then that’s where we’re at, [it’s]: Are we alive? Are we in it? Can I help the team and not hurt the team by being back out there? Can I protect myself? Can I move around, do all the things I want to do? If the answer’s yes, then we move in that direction. If the answer is no, then I’ve got to listen to my body.”Rodgers said he has not progressed to the point in his recovery at which he can make a decision about playing again this season. He spoke of participating in individual drills soon during practices as his next step.“Whether or not I come back this year, it’s been a lot of lessons and a lot of things I’m thankful for in the midst of some really frustrating and sad times,” Rodgers said.Rodgers underwent a surgical procedure designed to speed his recovery and has taken an aggressive approach to his rehabilitation. If he plays, he reportedly could target the Dec. 24 game against the Washington Commanders in East Rutherford, N.J. The Jets have said Rodgers must be cleared by doctors to return.Rodgers turns 40 on Saturday. He and the Jets would be wise to proceed gradually and cautiously during offseason practices, with an eye toward having him healthy for next season. The championship dreams for this season are long gone. Having Rodgers play during what’s left of this lost season and put himself at risk for being injured again imperils next season as well.The Jets have lost four straight games. They’ve benched Zach Wilson in favor of Tim Boyle, who’s winless in four career starts and managed to throw an interception that was returned for a touchdown on a Hail Mary pass during Friday’s loss to the Miami Dolphins. The Jets face the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. That is followed by games against the playoff-contending Houston Texans and the Dolphins. There’s a good chance the Jets will be 5-9 or 4-10 entering the Christmas Eve game.The Buffalo Bills played at a championship-contender level Sunday in Philadelphia. They amassed 505 yards. They converted 13 of 22 third downs. They had just one turnover. Quarterback Josh Allen threw for 339 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 81 yards and two touchdowns. If the Bills had performed like that all season, they would be right back in the Super Bowl-contending mix.Unfortunately for them, they have not. And even more unfortunately, their opponent Sunday was the NFL’s top team. The Eagles tied the score with a 59-yard field goal by Jake Elliott in soggy conditions with 20 seconds remaining in regulation. Then, after the Bills got a go-ahead field goal in overtime, the Eagles crafted a masterful touchdown drive to prevail, 37-34, on Jalen Hurts’s 12-yard quarterback keeper.According to ESPN, the Bills were the 40th team since the 1970 merger to have at least 500 yards and at least 10 third-down conversions in a game with a positive turnover margin. They were the first of those 40 teams to lose the game.The Bills are facing an uphill climb to make a fifth straight postseason appearance. They are 10th in the AFC. That’s only a half-game out of the seventh and final playoff spot. But they face the Kansas City Chiefs and the Dallas Cowboys in their next two games.It has been a season filled with injuries suffered by prominent quarterbacks. Rodgers may not play again this season. The Cincinnati Bengals’ Joe Burrow, the Minnesota Vikings’ Kirk Cousins, the Cleveland Browns’ Deshaun Watson and the New York Giants’ Daniel Jones suffered season-ending injuries. Indianapolis Colts rookie Anthony Richardson had shoulder surgery that probably ended his season.But the quarterback who had the greatest injury-related uncertainty entering the season plays on. Tua Tagovailoa has remained healthy and in the lineup for the Dolphins, establishing himself as an MVP contender in his fourth season.Last season, Tagovailoa did not play again after suffering his second diagnosed concussion of the season during a Christmas Day game against the Green Bay Packers. He missed the Dolphins’ final two regular season games and their opening-round playoff loss to the Bills. Some wondered if his career could be in jeopardy.Tagovailoa had missed two games earlier last season after being diagnosed with a concussion. He was taken from the field on a stretcher and transported by ambulance to a hospital after a hit during a late September game in Cincinnati. Tagovailoa sat out two October games. Four days before the game in Cincinnati, doctors had cleared Tagovailoa to return to a game against the Bills after the quarterback stumbled following a first-half hit.Amid intense public scrutiny, the NFL and the NFL Players Association conducted a joint review. They concluded the concussion protocol was followed “as written.” But they also acknowledged that the outcome was “not what was intended” and agreed to a modification of the protocol that eliminated an exception that allowed Tagovailoa to reenter the game against the Bills.Tagovailoa has stayed out of harm’s way this season, leading the Dolphins to an 8-3 record. He is the NFL’s fourth-rated passer and could sign a lucrative contract extension in the offseason.Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper made an in-season coaching move for a second straight season Monday when he fired Frank Reich and elevated special teams coordinator Chris Tabor to interim coach. The Panthers have a league-worst record of 1-10 and are 30-63 since Tepper purchased the franchise in 2018.“Obviously that record’s not good enough,” Tepper said at a news conference Tuesday. “There’s no hiding it. … We’re going to self-reflect and make it better.”Tepper is about to hire the fourth full-time head coach of his tenure. The Panthers also have had three interim coaches during Tepper’s ownership. Even so, Tepper said he does not believe he will have difficulty convincing a top-quality coach to take the job.“My reputation away from this game is one for extreme patience,” Tepper said. “There’s no reason why that doesn’t come here, too. It does. Now, that patience comes with good performance. … I would like to have somebody here for 20, 30 years. I’d like to have somebody that would say [the] eulogy at my funeral in 30 years — okay, maybe it’s 40 years.”Tepper said it was unanimous among Panthers coaches and scouts to use the No. 1 selection in this year’s draft on quarterback Bryce Young, and Tepper supported that choice. He remains “totally confident” in that decision, he said, even with Young struggling in his rookie season.Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson was believed to have been a strong candidate for the Panthers in their head coaching search following last season. But he opted to remain in Detroit, and the Panthers hired Reich. Johnson is being mentioned again as a top candidate in Carolina. But he could be in demand during the offseason, and it’s debatable how attractive the Panthers’ job will be in comparison to other potential vacancies. Eagles offensive coordinator Brian Johnson also could be a target for the Panthers.Two head coaches, Reich and the Las Vegas Raiders’ Josh McDaniels, have been fired this season. Some expect there could be as many as 10 vacancies leaguewide by the time the hiring cycle commences in the offseason.There has been plenty of speculation about the job security of the Chargers’ Brandon Staley, the Commanders’ Rivera, the Chicago Bears’ Matt Eberflus and even Bill Belichick, the six-time Super Bowl winner for the Patriots. Mike Vrabel is under contract to the Tennessee Titans but has been mentioned as a potential successor to Belichick in New England.With every team in the NFC South below .500, Reich might not end up being the only coach fired in that division. Sean McDermott has had plenty of success in Buffalo, but the Bills have struggled this season. New York’s teams have a combined record of 8-15, although the Jets’ Robert Saleh and the Giants’ Brian Daboll could be safe.“I think most people would guess it’s going to be very active,” one agent who represents coaches said.When the Packers traded Rodgers to the Jets in April, they were motivated in part by the desire to clear the way for third-year quarterback Jordan Love. And though there have been the expected ups and downs for the 2020 first-round draft choice, things could be trending in a positive direction.Love was superb in the Packers’ victory in Detroit on Thanksgiving, throwing for 268 yards and three touchdowns. He has five touchdown passes and no interceptions over the past two games. The Packers, at 5-6, are only a half-game out of the seventh and final playoff spot in the NFC.It doesn’t seem crucial for them to reach the postseason in Year 1 with Love as the starter. There’s little chance they would be a threat to make a run deep into the playoffs. Rather, the issue is Love establishing himself as a reliable starter. And he’s making progress in that regard.He has been inconsistent. He has thrown too many interceptions. He is only the NFL’s 20th-rated passer. His 10 interceptions are three off the league high.But he is demonstrating, more and more, that he is capable of being the centerpiece of a promising team. If the Packers emerge from the season with a positive feeling about Love, that will have been a success.The Cowboys are doing it again. They are raising hopes that they are capable of being a Super Bowl team. But they are a long way from proving they are capable of beating good teams in the NFC playoffs to get there.The Cowboys’ 45-10 triumph over the Commanders on Thanksgiving continued a season-long trend: The Cowboys are 8-1 against teams that currently have losing records and 0-2 against teams that currently have winning records. Their losses came to the San Francisco 49ers and the Eagles.The Cowboys have joined the Eagles, 49ers and Lions among the top NFC contenders. They are an excellent team with a top-notch defense. Their pass rush is ferocious, and cornerback DaRon Bland set a single-season NFL record with five touchdowns on interception returns. Quarterback Dak Prescott is the league’s second-rated passer and perhaps should be more prominent in the MVP conversation. CeeDee Lamb is a legitimate No. 1 receiver.But unless the Cowboys can overtake the Eagles in the NFC East, they are looking at the prospect of going on the road for the playoffs. And they probably would have to win two games while facing some combination of opponents from among the Eagles, 49ers and Lions. Perhaps the Cowboys can pull that off. But they probably don’t deserve the benefit of the doubt.As the Patriots’ season continues to crumble, it appears quarterback Mac Jones’s game may be broken beyond repair.Jones was dreadful again Sunday, and Belichick benched him again. The 2021 first-round pick threw two first-half interceptions while completing 12 of 21 passes for 89 yards. Belichick went to backup Bailey Zappe in the second half. Zappe was only marginally better, throwing an interception while connecting on 9 of 14 passes for 54 yards. He at least got the Patriots into the end zone as they lost to the Giants, 10-7, at the Meadowlands to fall to 2-9.All of that came after a week in which Belichick refused to name his starting quarterback until game day, following a long and miserable bye in the aftermath of a defeat to the Colts in Germany in which Belichick benched Jones late in the game.",11993,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/29/aaron-rodgers-jets-return-playoffs/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point suffer news josh scout pass uphill interception draft inconsistent torn loss south demand prevail review mcafee afc prescott espn coordinator aftermath rush clear back imperils tagovailoa green mcdaniels sunday procedure turn represent kansa eye active cowboy extreme late chris cornerback threw atlanta regulation anthony remain reason time goal patriot rivera april drive merger opt craft enter panther jalen agent long eberflus complete security passer contract motivate city wonder move cautiously pat hurt nfl jet lose score purchase coach tie straight october offseason entirely ran elevate charger vrabel throw probably issue harm direction search staley nfc prudence continued fire triumph capable intend miserable league exception record eagle bryce scrutiny bland desire selection confident tennessee east expect emerge played hospital surgery practice lamb currently believe away wise ownership excellent lion daron seventh target york franchise connect brown christmas stretcher brandon strong plenty protect raise watson colt season england potential sad refuse conclude minnesota design candidate appearance jordan frank bailey overtime difficulty speed friday conduct totally viking eve zach protocol regular brian chicago miss risk thankful centerpiece injury intense cousin dictate opponent raider saturday combination positive lucrative answer special head achilles giant uncertainty return gradually hiding follow play houston tim championship success underwent stumble career player progress backup earlier combine ceedee bear chance establish leaguewide stayed burrow eulogy join broken chief overtake alive september hope david starter prove reportedly snap interim owner deserve mike support trade jake top turnover frustrate run bay outcome listen titan threat acknowledge fill bye quarterback commences hire ups falcon final dallas drill buffalo elliott masterful lineup comparison notion make sign amass great year tepper level dream feel cincinnati guess mac dreadful part touchdown matt thanksgiving jones aggressive daniel perform rutherford johnson spoke hit choice team beating pull reliable offensive proceed mention road bid hail bench joint game dolphin crucial surgical start extension accord continue speculation cleveland bowl reenter texan love zone demonstrate rodgers field successor tabor mcdermott past patience diagnose eliminate decision convert attractive carolina vacancy approach tendon san contender set monday spot association zappe funeral deep commander abandon philadelphia rehabilitation fall modification francisco winner conference dak thrown doctor prominent yard win left tenure wilson deshaun percent midst daboll leg robert promising joe ahead unanimous climb performance remains bill reich superb shoulder washington struggle convincing job boyle margin reputation conversation concussion packer marginally healthy kirk rookie detroit victory miami winless agree young put trend reach debatable division meadowlands bengal lesson fourth half conversion public crumble lead show aaron transport richardson benefit pick defense germany ambulance lot sat tuesday belichick mvp playoff unfortunately cycle week favor legitimate postseason individual recovery prospect defeat saleh injured mary day ferocious condition manage soggy vega indianapolis super participate,0.9951,0.025014591845243,8.557464177160224,0.5140385290385291,0,2023-11-29

CNN,Stanley Cup champion Corey Perry waived by Chicago Blackhawks for ‘unacceptable’ conduct,2023-11-29 05:46:00,David Close,"The Chicago Blackhawks have waived veteran forward Corey Perry on Tuesday following an internal investigation.The NHL team said Perry “engaged in conduct that is unacceptable” and was “in violation both of the terms of his Standard Player’s Contract and the Blackhawks’ internal policies intended to promote professional and safe work environments.”The Blackhawks did not reveal any details surrounding the alleged conduct.CNN has reached out to Perry for comment.A spokesperson for the NHLPA said the players union was “reviewing the matter.”Chicago signed the 38-year-old to a one-year deal in the summer to help lead an inexperienced, young roster. He played in 16 games, scoring four goals and assisting on five others.Perry has not played since being an unexpected healthy scratch for the November 22 game versus the Columbus Blue Jackets. Head coach Luke Richardson told reporters after the game in Columbus that it was an “organizational decision” to not feature Perry - who at the time was the team’s third-leading scorer with nine points.On Saturday, ‘Hawks general manager Kyle Davidson said the right winger was “away from the team” and would be for the “foreseeable future.”The Blackhawks stated: “In the event Mr. Perry clears waivers, we intend to terminate his contract effective immediately.”Perry has played in 1,273 NHL games while scoring 421 career goals.

CNN,‘How on earth has he given that?’: Newcastle denied famous win over PSG after controversial VAR penalty decision,2023-11-29 05:28:00,Matias Grez,"Newcastle United was denied a famous away win over Paris Saint-Germain after the French side was awarded a late penalty following yet another controversial VAR decision.Trailing 1-0 to Alexander Isak’s 24th-minute goal, PSG swarmed the Newcastle goal throughout the second half but without any success.Then, in the fifth minute of injury time, Ousmane Dembélé was halted as he tried to get past Tino Livramento inside the Magpies’ box, leading to huge penalty appeals from the PSG squad.Referee Szymon Marciniak – usually considered to be among the elite of European officials – immediately went over to the pitch-side monitor to check the replays, which showed Dembélé had kicked the ball into Livramento’s chest from point-blank range, before it ricocheted onto the Newcastle defender’s arm.It’s likely that most fans watching will have expected Marciniak to run back onto the pitch and wave away the PSG appeals, but instead he signaled for a penalty kick.“He’s given it, I can’t believe it,” TNT Sports commentator Darren Fletcher said. “How on earth has he given that?”Co-commentator Ally McCoist added: “That is a shambles. A shambles. Honestly, it’s not on.“If that’s a penalty kick, we might as well give the game up. That’s nonsense. Nonsense. If he’s the best ref in the business – and he probably is – how can he give that?”Kylian Mbappé converted the penalty emphatically to earn PSG a huge 1-1 draw – a loss would have meant the Parisians’ destiny was out of their hands – and break the hearts of Newcastle’s players and the thousands of fans that had traveled to Paris.After the match, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said he was “still coming to terms” with the decision to award PSG a spot kick.“I feel really flat, but at the same time very, very pleased with what the players have given today,” Howe told TNT Sports after the game. “We rode our luck at times, but I think we deserved that and we sort of ran out of luck at the end because I didn’t think it was a penalty.“What you’re not taking into account watching the replay is how quick that ball is live and it’s hit his chest first – I think that’s the key thing. If it hits is hand first, I still don’t think it would be a penalty because of the close proximity, but I think you can make more of a case.“I don’t think there is a case when it hits another body part first and his hands are low.”Bizarrely, Marciniak didn’t award PSG a penalty earlier in the match when the ball bounced up off Lewis Miley’s leg and hit his arm, highlighting not only the lack of consistency across matches, but also in the same match.Following a UEFA meeting in April this year, European football’s governing body put a number of suggestions forward to the International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body that determines the laws of football, which included not penalizing players for handball if the ball has previously deflected off a player’s own body.The current IFAB rule book doesn’t mention deflections off a player’s body, but does say a penalty should be awarded if a player “is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger [with] the position of their hand/arm.”CNN has reached out to UEFA for comment.Borussia Dortmund’s 3-1 win over AC Milan secured its place in the knockout stages, but with just two points separating PSG, Milan and Newcastle, all three teams can still reach the last 16, though a Paris win would ensure Mbappé and Co. make it through to the knockouts.Dortmund hosts PSG in Group F’s final gameweek, while Newcastle welcomes Milan.",3535,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/sport/newcastle-psg-handball-champions-league-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point stage run lack international host penalize luck separate draw kylian loss united final chest inside check make forward miley year back feel milan halt part include fletcher earth minute close late howe hit ref huge famous team ally time goal commentator marciniak mention april today game knockout f cnn highlight hand big ensure football deny honestly side pleased previously french match pitch suggestion current quick darren swarm past ran kick decision probably convert magpie welcome secure signal mccoist spot sport meeting nonsense association livramento monitor newcastle szymon dortmund number break meant paris rule win european consistency expect arm manager instead proximity award alexander leg board controversial destiny believe ball earn away bounce tnt unnaturally range deflection penalty book handball place ousmane shamble sort gameweek bizarrely add isak official wave travel told dembélé box give put business mbappé live reach appeal injury lewis flat consider replay emphatically half rode determines deflect defender lead show ricochet account law follow case term player psg parisian earlier ac eddie group thousand body key govern heart uefa position ifab deserve tino elite immediately watch,0.9746,0.1697312588401697,7.43561643835616,0.4483695652173913,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,"Commanders’ struggles won’t last forever, but neither do NFL careers",2023-11-29 05:05:00,Candace Buckner,"That sound echoing over the final weeks of the Washington Commanders’ season? It isn’t just a death knell but also the chorus of voices guessing who might become the team’s next head coach.The prospect of something novel, something different, might dominate the thoughts of the fan base and probably those of owner Josh Harris. But the move for new should also provoke fresh sympathy for mainstays such as defensive tackle Jonathan Allen, wide receiver Terry McLaurin and, yes, even the punter, Tress Way. (Punters can suffer, too.)If and when Harris wants a do-over and fires Coach Ron Rivera, the clock will reset for the franchise. That’s great news for a fan base starving for a winner at FedEx Field. And yet the hands keep moving for three longtime players. Allen, McLaurin and Way have spent the entirety of their careers stuck in this turbulence, and they don’t get a do-over.A month before Allen, who won a national championship with the Crimson Tide, was drafted into this franchise in 2017, the overlord in charge at the time fired the general manager, who was treated to a smear campaign on his way out of town. Uhhh, you’re not in Alabama anymore, Jon.Usually, when a star wideout signs an extension, the news conference is all rainbows and unicorns, just pomp and fluff abounding as the player and coach dream about a rosy future and then wear big smiles for the cameras. But in the summer of 2022, when McLaurin had his moment to trumpet a three-year extension worth more than $70 million, the announcement arrived with a congressional investigation still looming over the team. Really, who wouldn’t want to re-sign with the House Oversight Committee’s favorite football franchise?And Way, at 33 the resident lifer in the locker room, has experienced just one nine-win season in his 10 years in Washington. That’s a lot of time spent flipping the field and doing his job well enough to be considered among the best in the NFL, only for his efforts to aid his team to a .411 regular season winning percentage.“Whenever the game is done, it is definitely a solid afternoon and evening of just a blank stare. You replay everything in your head: ‘What in the world?!’ ” Way said, explaining how he processes a loss. And I have to imagine how Way and the others might have stared out the plane windows Thursday night, following that 45-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, watching blurs pass by. Just like their best years as professional football players.But …“That next time you sit down to watch film and game-plan for the next team, it’s gone,” Way continued. “It’s like a visual trigger. I know that sounds crazy. … You better do that, or you’re going to get left in the freakin’ dust. But that’s what I would say makes it much easier to move on from that stuff — you’re with guys you love, doing what you love, and you just want to do everything you can to win.”Though they’ve tried to stabilize this franchise into a winning operation, the “C” these players wear on their chests has represented Chaos. They’re the captains drifting away at sea, in need of life vests as their primes waste away without winning a thing. These company men may soon have more tenure than almost everyone else in the building — including the legion of new owners and a revamped front office and coaching staff.They’re the Commanders who didn’t get away, unlike old buddies Taylor Heinicke, whose Atlanta Falcons sit atop a weak NFL South, and Chase Young, who gets to pursue a Super Bowl with the San Francisco 49ers.It’s hard not to feel a measure of sympathy for them. Especially for a Pro Bowl lineman like Allen, soon to be 29. Allen gave us a peek into his frustrations as they boiled over following the first of two losses to the New York Giants. On Oct. 22, Allen spoke for himself but truly anybody clocking hours in a dead-end job when he said: “I’m f---ing tired of this bulls---. It’s been seven f---ing years of this same s---.”And how can you not have mercy for a wideout like McLaurin, who possesses that “overlooked” reputation only because he has been toiling for 1,000-yard seasons while catching passes from a carousel of quarterbacks? Ten starting signal-callers in 4½ years? The man deserves a hug for enduring the Kyle Allen era. Now running routes for second-year pro Sam Howell, McLaurin, 28, is posting career lows in yards per game, yards per catch and touchdowns per game.McLaurin said something interesting ahead of the Dallas game: “Losing sucks. Especially when you lose back-to-back, but at the same time, nobody’s going to feel sorry for where you’re at in the season.” But you’ve got to feel something for McLaurin, Allen and Way.“Thank you,” Way said with a smile. “But I promise you we do not take a step back and look at that at all.”None of these players is asking for our tears. And, please, don’t get me wrong: They are well-compensated professionals playing a game and living a dream that millions of wannabes and washouts would love to have.“Those are truly the guys I feel sad for,” Allen said. “Guys who legitimately could’ve been stars in this league but for whatever reason never had an opportunity.”Allen shared this with me recently, as teammates lounged in leather-bound recliners, playing cards, and radio-friendly pop hits blasted over the speakers. After practice, the players even get little cups of Italian ice. More refreshing than orange slices, I’d bet. So, yes, life in the NFL has its perks. Still, while a new regime might re-energize the fans, it won’t give back the years endured by these most loyal Commanders.“I try to focus on what I can do to get better because I know I haven’t been perfect this year. There’s some opportunities that I’ve missed,” McLaurin said. “And so I don’t really focus a lot of the time on what everybody else got going on, but it definitely is challenging when you haven’t quite been on the winning side consistently. We’re competitors, you know what I mean? … But at the same time, you just have to continue to work your butt off and try to be part of the solution.“Obviously, you don’t want to become a consistent loser,” McLaurin continued. “But at the same time, I don’t think stuff like this will last forever.”Technically, that’s true. The Commanders’ irrelevance may not last into eternity, but neither will the windows for Allen, McLaurin and Way. That’s why, when change happens — a new coach on the sideline and new players in the locker room — it will be a reminder of how little success the team’s standbys have enjoyed.Despite the cushy chairs and delicious post-practice treats — and, of course, the zeros attached to their paychecks — Allen, McLaurin and Way have not experienced the best part of playing in the NFL: winning.",6720,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/29/commanders-franchise-reset/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,suffer news josh run company punter lifer pass post delicious revamped quarterback moment draft loss chorus south echo falcon final solid dallas chest abound make kyle sign ron great arrive year carousel refresh voice paycheck back stare dream feel guess lounge smile pomp orange part represent touchdown include blank cowboy definitely dominate experienced recently million fluff change freakin announcement waste spoke hit turbulence eternity atlanta promise team reason hour ice time dust especially technically rivera focus wrong stabilize game standby course plane operation f imagine start hand tackle big blast extension trigger continue pro bowl reset oversight football recliner move side share heinicke love trumpet ten card sideline field camera posse nfl easy lose butt catch coach speaker resident bet summer perfect probably terry wannabe italian san chase mclaurin deserves continued sam legion measure spent unicorn thursday fire mainstay office commander endure wide stuck challenge irrelevance league francisco winner tress drift worth chaos teammate knell conference month win attach yard left mercy defensive manager howell tenure boil lineman sorry night interest pop fresh visual loom slice guy practice reminder future ahead jonathan away harris rosy unlike tear captain hard locker effort campaign york franchise starve front washington season national work sad base overlord life frustration wear longtime step job house building sound loser investigation reputation hug afternoon town living film competitor tide uhhh give young pursue anymore death charge blur bull flip general wideout regular aid stuff committee prime miss room entirety zero consider replay opportunity taylor tire world sympathy overlook low weak atop regime consistent head giant different follow play perk lot buddy crazy vest rainbow championship success legitimately player career crimson peek smear fedex treat week cup provoke star favorite chair route toil congressional explain prospect loyal clock professional owner process consistently suck window washout alabama cushy receiver watch super,0.9885,0.0892857142857142,6.1964095371669,0.4521331966644467,0,2023-11-29
USA TODAY,Mark Cuban in serious talks to sell significant share of Dallas Mavericks to Adelson family,2023-11-29 02:19:49,Jeff Zillgitt,"The Adelson family is in serious discussions with Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban to purchase a significant share of the NBA franchise, a person familiar with negotiations told USA TODAY Sports. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal. Miriam Adelson, the widow of Las Vegas Sands Corp. founder Sheldon Adelson, and her family in an SEC filing dated Tuesday said it is selling $2 billion of LVS stock and “they currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, along with additional cash on hand, to fund the purchase of a majority interest in a professional sports franchise pursuant to a binding purchase agreement, subject to customary league approvals.” Cuban would retain shares of the team and remain the governor, the person said. Cuban on Monday announced the 16th season of 'Shark Tank' will be his last. He bought the franchise for a valuation of $285 million in 2000. While the exact purchase price is not yet determined, Mat Ishbia purchased the NBA’s Phoenix Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury for a $4 billion valuation a year ago. Earlier this year, Adelson’s son, Matan Adelson, bought Hapoel Jerusalem of the Israeli Basketball Premier League. Cuban has been one of the league’s most prominent owners in the past two decades and one of the most fined, racking up nearly $4 million in fines — and that doesn’t include $10 million Cuban donated to women’s groups following an investigation into a toxic work environment, including sexual harassment and workplace misconduct, within the Mavericks’ organization. The Mavericks have made two Finals appearances under Cuban, winning the 2011 title against the Miami Heat and LeBron James. As noted in the SEC filing, a sale is subject to approval by NBA owners.

Washington Post,"Lakers, Celtics, Bucks headline NBA in-season tournament knockout round",2023-11-29 01:31:00,Ben Golliver,"LOS ANGELES — LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jayson Tatum are among the stars whose teams remain alive in the NBA’s inaugural in-season tournament.The eight-team field for the knockout round was finalized Tuesday night, with the Boston Celtics, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks and New York Knicks advancing from the Eastern Conference and the Los Angeles Lakers, New Orleans Pelicans, Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings qualifying from the Western Conference.Those quarterfinalists survived an opening round in which the league’s 30 teams divided into six groups of five. Each team played the other four teams in its group once. The six group winners automatically qualified for the quarterfinals, and the final two spots were filled by a wild card from each conference.Several teams punched their tickets to the quarterfinals with victories Tuesday: Milwaukee defeated the Miami Heat, 131-124; Boston blew out the Chicago Bulls, 124-97; New York topped the Charlotte Hornets, 115-91; and Sacramento beat the Golden State Warriors, 124-123. The Pacers and the Lakers were the only teams to clinch their spots before Tuesday.The knockout round will begin next week with single-elimination quarterfinal games hosted by the top teams from the group stage: The Pacers will host the Celtics and the Kings will host the Pelicans on Dec. 4, while the Bucks will host the Knicks and the Lakers will host the Suns on Dec. 5.The winners of those four games will advance to the tournament semifinals, which will be held at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Dec. 7. The East semifinalists will play the West semifinalists, guaranteeing an East-vs.-West matchup in the Dec. 9 championship game, which will also be held in Las Vegas. Each player on the winning team will earn a $500,000 bonus, and each player on the runner-up will earn $200,000. The NBA also will announce an in-season tournament MVP and an all-tournament team.The Pacers and Bucks posted 4-0 records to win East Group A and East Group B. The Celtics went 3-1 to win Group C, topping the Orlando Magic (3-1) and Brooklyn Nets (3-1) on a tiebreaker. The Knicks, who went 3-1 to finish second in East Group B, claimed the wild-card spot over the Cleveland Cavaliers (3-1), Magic and Nets thanks to a point-differential tiebreaker.The Lakers won West Group A with a 4-0 record, the Pelicans won West Group B with a 3-1 record and the Kings went 4-0 to win West Group C. The Suns (3-1) claimed the wild-card spot over the Minnesota Timberwolves (3-1) on a point-differential tiebreaker.The defending champion Denver Nuggets finished with a 2-2 record in West Group B and were eliminated, while the reigning Eastern Conference champion Heat fell short of the quarterfinals with a 2-2 record in East Group B. The Washington Wizards lost all four of their tournament games and finished in the East Group B basement.Tuesday’s dramatic results — including nail-biting wins by the Bucks and Kings — lived up to the NBA’s hopes that the in-season tournament would become an early-season “tent pole” event capable of increasing fan interest and television viewership before its annual Christmas showcase and All-Star Weekend in February.All in-season tournament games, with the exception of the championship game, will count as part of each team’s 82-game regular season schedule.

NPR,"Mark Cuban working on sale of NBA's Mavericks to Sands casino family, AP source says",2023-11-29 01:12:00,The Associated Press,"Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is working on a deal to sell a majority stake in the NBA franchise to the family that runs the Las Vegas Sands casino company, a person with knowledge of the talks said Tuesday night. The agreement would be in the valuation range of $3.5 billion and take weeks for the league to process, according to the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details weren't being made public. Cuban would retain control of basketball operations in the deal. NBA reporter Marc Stein was the first to report the potential sale. The company controlled by Miriam Adelson, widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, announced earlier Tuesday it was selling $2 billion of her shares to buy an unspecified professional sports team. Cuban said almost a year ago he was interested in partnering with Sands. He has been a proponent of legalizing gambling in Texas, an issue that didn't make it out of the state Legislature in a biennial session that ended earlier this year. The 65-year-old Cuban, who just announced he was leaving the popular business TV program ""Shark Tank"" after a 16th season next year, rose to fame quickly after buying the Mavericks in 2000. Dallas was one of the worst franchises in pro sports in the 1990s, but turned into one of the best under Cuban, with a lot of help from star forward Dirk Nowitzki. Miriam Adelson is the controlling shareholder of Las Vegas Sands Corp., a publicly traded Las Vegas company that built the Venetian and Palazzo resorts but now only has casino operations in Macau and Singapore. Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire founder and owner of Las Vegas Sands, died in 2021 at 87. The company revealed the sale of $2 billion in stock in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing identified Adelson and the Miriam Adelson Trust as sellers but didn't specify a team, league or location. If the entirety of the $2 billion goes toward the purchase, it would mean Adelson could be acquiring at least 57% of the NBA team â€” based on the $3.5 billion valuation. The 78-year-old Adelson, who is a medical doctor, will retain 51.3% of company shares following the sale, according to the filing. The family also owns Nevada's largest newspaper, the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""We have been advised by the selling stockholders that they currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, along with additional cash on hand, to fund the purchase of a majority interest in a professional sports franchise ... subject to customary league approvals,"" the company said in the SEC filing. The vetting process for new owners in the NBA typically takes at least several weeks, and then approval must be granted by the league's Board of Governors. Cuban also said late last year he wanted to build a new arena in downtown Dallas that would also be a casino resort, if Texas does legalize gambling. Supporters of legalized gambling in Texas hoped to get a constitutional amendment to voters during the most recent session, but the measure didn't get far in the legislative process. The Republican-controlled Legislature doesn't meet in regular session again until 2025. Cuban isn't likely to disappear from the spotlight since he will retain control of basketball operations. In fact, efforts to legalize gambling in Texas could end up raising the profile of a billionaire who has been highly visible in sports, business and finance for nearly 25 years. A self-professed basketball junkie who graduated from Indiana University, Cuban is almost always courtside for Mavericks games. He has always been outspoken, too, compiling millions in fines as owner. Many of his tirades were directed at officials.",3709,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/28/1215747661/mark-cuban-working-on-sale-of-nbas-mavericks-to-sands-casino-family-ap-source-sa,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,amendment partner billionaire run company typically leave program press vet announce dallas make rise forward year reporter legislature retain commission visible offering deal specify agreement buy magnate sheldon interested turn legislative quickly million acquire late spoke biennial macau team detail disappear hop fine game shareholder operation trust spotlight stock unspecified hand accord pro compile family security buying filing newspaper shark share finance report gamble meet associate sell voter direct additional purchase medical supporter fame indiana highly profile location issue advise sport measure tirade basketball talk governor valuation dirk intend majority texas session league university marc anonymity nowitzki founder doctor billion knowledge subject sand tank constitutional night interest seller sec board miriam palazzo currently grant legalize range proponent state large effort downtown franchise person raise popular season work potential tv built base exchange official identify ago mark publicly cash business approval regular adelson graduate nba entirety build public maverick widow net follow lot tuesday cuban proceeds courtside outspoken resort arena casino control earlier week star customary recent nevada fact professional owner process stein condition singapore stockholder junkie stake venetian trade vega reveal fund,0.98785,0.0808843354003774,9.188866571018648,0.4379533500687346,0,2023-11-29

Washington Post,"Ahead of its Big Ten opener, Maryland romps to a third straight win",2023-11-28 22:33:00,Gene Wang,"The Maryland men’s basketball team had its final tuneup Tuesday night before it begins Big Ten Conference play. Not long after tip-off at Xfinity Center, the proceedings resembled a scrimmage, with the Terrapins surging to an all-but-insurmountable lead in the first half and then coasting to a 103-76 triumph against overmatched Rider.Behind 22 points apiece from Jahmir Young and Julian Reese, Maryland (4-3) scored its most points of the season and won its third straight heading into Friday night’s Big Ten opener at Indiana. Maryland also moved above .500 for the first time since it beat Mount St. Mary’s in the season opener.The Terps extended their winning streak in College Park to 15 games, the eighth longest in the country, thanks in part to making 33 of 57 field goals (57.9 percent). Their previous top shooting performance was 49 percent against the Mountaineers.“Just coming off three wins, [we’re] going on the road with the mentality that we’re just trying to build on those wins and catch our rhythm,” Young said. “I feel like we’re doing that now.”Young shot 6 for 10, including 4 for 7 on three-pointers. The fifth-year point guard, a former standout at DeMatha in his second season with the Terps after three at Charlotte, added five assists and two steals with one turnover in 29 minutes.While notching his fourth double-double of the season and the 11th of his career, Reese compiled the majority of his points at the free throw line, where he went 14 for 17. The junior finished with 12 rebounds to reach double digits for a third consecutive game.Jordan Geronimo contributed his most efficient performance since joining Maryland following three seasons with Indiana. The 6-6 forward finished with 15 points on 6-for-6 shooting; he has made 13 of 17 shots (76.8 percent) over the past three games.“We just went out there and wanted to get after it,” Geronimo said. “... Playing with a lot of energy leads to defensive stops and easy buckets. That was kind of the main goal.”Also encouraging was the Terps committing just six turnovers, the first time they have been in single digits this season. Maryland, which had committed 27 turnovers in its previous two games, came in averaging 13.8, the second most in the Big Ten.Maryland forced 15 Rider turnovers (11 of which came on steals), held a 23-11 advantage in points off turnovers and went 8 for 20 (40 percent) from behind the arc for by far its best showing of the season. Mervin James led Rider (1-5) of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference with 28 points on 10-for-15 shooting with eight rebounds. He was among three Broncs to foul out.A 17-2 run allowed Maryland to forge a 54-27 halftime lead while sending a cavalcade of players to the free throw line. The Terps went 21 for 32 on foul shots in the first half, including Reese going 8 for 10.A stretch of five consecutive free throws gave Maryland its first double-digit lead, and the margin grew to 39-18 when DeShawn Harris-Smith made 1 of 2 from the line followed by four straight from Reese and Young. The lead ballooned to 29 points later in the half.Given the lopsided score, Coach Kevin Willard had the luxury of substituting liberally in the first half. Eleven players logged minutes in the opening 20 minutes, allowing his starters and top reserves to enjoy extended rest.Harris-Smith, the reigning All-Met Player of the Year from Paul VI, provided an early spark with three straight assists, including two that led to three-pointers by fellow freshman Jamie Kaiser Jr. Kaiser, a Burke native, finished 2 for 3 from behind the arc after making 3 of 23 tries in the first six games.",3626,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/28/maryland-basketball-rider-jahmir-young-julian-reese/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point conference xfinity run win defensive mervin contribute double night eighth percent shoot shot advantage finish halftime overmatched maryland final willard stop julian athletic balloon center make fellow spark enjoy forward notch scrimmage country year performance force feel jahmir begin part coast kind atlantic stretch substitute include send minute early season add efficient margin tuneup guard digit cavalcade streak consecutive eleven beat team junior terrapin friday time goal bronc young give road steal lopsided game assist reach james burke former apiece opener mentality paul build terps long big fourth rider half compile provide surge bucket native liberally kaiser rhythm reign lead move charlotte reserve show head ten standout foul field previous follow score easy average catch play lot coach tuesday commit straight indiana past resemble grow reese career throw player single held freshman kevin encourage deshawn line join energy arc starter mount proceeding college geronimo forge basketball triumph free luxury mary dematha extend rebound park top majority turnover metro opening jamie,0.99045,0.0,8.800286123032901,0.3362519201228877,0,2023-11-28
Washington Post,Mark Cuban agrees to sell majority share of Mavericks to Adelson family,2023-11-28 21:22:00,Ben Golliver,"Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban agreed to sell a majority stake in his NBA franchise to Miriam Adelson, widow of billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, and her family, multiple people with knowledge of the agreement confirmed to The Washington Post on Tuesday.Cuban, a 65-year-old entrepreneur and reality television star who co-founded broadcast.com, purchased the Mavericks for $285 million from H. Ross Perot Jr. in 2000. Under terms of the sale to the Adelsons, which is subject to approval by the NBA’s board of governors, Cuban will retain an ownership stake and maintain control over basketball operations. The Associated Press reported that the agreement would be in the valuation range of $3.5 billion. Marc Stein and the Athletic previously reported the deal’s terms.Sheldon Adelson founded Las Vegas Sands, an international gambling company that included the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas and properties in Asia. He died at 87 in 2021. Miriam Adelson, 78, and her family remain major shareholders in Las Vegas Sands, and the Israeli-born physician and newspaper publisher is the fifth-richest woman in the United States with a net worth of $32.8 billion, according to a recent estimate by Forbes.In an SEC filing made public Tuesday, the Adelson family announced it was selling $2 billion worth of Las Vegas Sands stock to “fund the purchase of a majority interest in a professional sports franchise pursuant to a binding purchase agreement.”Cuban, whose net worth is estimated at $6.2 billion, said last year that he was hoping to “partner” with Las Vegas Sands to build a new arena and resort complex, according to the Dallas Morning News, though sports gambling is not legal in Texas. The Mavericks have played at American Airlines Center in downtown Dallas since 2001.An NBA spokesperson declined to comment on the agreement Tuesday night. The Mavericks referred questions about the agreement to the Adelson family, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Mavericks, who missed the playoffs every year from 1991 to 2000, were transformed by Cuban’s arrival. Hall of Fame forward Dirk Nowitzki led Dallas to its first championship in 2011, and the team has made the playoffs in 18 of the past 23 seasons.While Cuban has incurred a long list of fines as owner for everything from complaining about the officials to overseeing a late-season tanking effort, he has been credited with modernizing the Mavericks by improving team facilities and focusing on amenities that appeal to players. Dallas acquired franchise guard Luka Doncic with a draft-day trade in 2018, traded for all-star guard Kyrie Irving this February and entered Tuesday’s game against Houston with a 10-6 record. For much of his ownership tenure, Cuban has starred on ABC’s “Shark Tank,” but he announced Monday that he will leave the show after its upcoming season.NBA franchise values have skyrocketed over the past decade, and the agreement between Cuban and the Adelson family follows several other recent transactions. Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam agreed to purchase a stake in the Milwaukee Bucks in April. NBA legend Michael Jordan agreed to sell a majority stake of the Charlotte Hornets to Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin in June. In July, the Qatar Investment Authority acquired a 5 percent stake of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the ownership group that oversees the Washington Wizards, the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and the NHL’s Washington Capitals.In an interview with Showtime Basketball last week, Cuban expressed reservations about the NBA’s long-term financial picture, given the changing media landscape from traditional television to streaming services.“In 2010, remember, with New Orleans, no one would buy [the franchise] and the league had to take it over,” Cuban said. “I’m not saying it’s going to be like that, but the point is that it’s not automatic that everything always gets better.”",3931,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/28/mavericks-sale-mark-cuban-adelson-family/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point partner billionaire news express company international michael improve asia leave post modernize press milwaukee traditional pursuant announce doncic united american dallas make center airline forward oversee year retain deal legend medium oversees agreement buy magnate sheldon nhl include amenity million credit haslam change request acquire mystic property guard picture team remain woman maintain skyrocket hop focus april spokesperson fine game interview enter shareholder operation estimate wnba luka stock long accord family cleveland filing newspaper shark charlotte previously report gamble associate sell hornet purchase perot fame plotkin past schnall morning showtime facility entrepreneur monday sport basketball found governor valuation dirk question complex majority texas league record marc stream incur worth nowitzki billion adelsons knowledge subject sand tank tenure entertainment orleans played night percent interest sec board miriam complain athletic reservation ownership transform range monumental state wizard effort comment downtown franchise brown publisher washington buck june official february ross landscape jordan mark binding qatar agree give arrival approval adelson miss nba appeal build refer kyrie list july remember investment major financial public lead authority decline maverick widow reality show net follow transaction abc decade upcoming tuesday cuban houston rick respond playoff championship arena term resort casino player control week physician legal value star group multiple jimmy recent television automatic confirm professional owner stein irving stake venetian trade hall vega immediately fund,0.986,0.0,10.70092050209205,0.2504978354978355,0,2023-11-28
Washington Post,"Georgia, Michigan, Washington, Florida State are atop CFP with one week left",2023-11-28 19:43:00,Chuck Culpepper,"Georgia remained at No. 1 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings Tuesday night despite a big push from Michigan, which rode its win over Ohio State to replace the Buckeyes at No. 2. As Ohio State slid to No. 6, three teams advanced: No. 3 Washington (12-0), No. 4 Florida State (12-0) and No. 5 Oregon (11-1).These were the fifth of the six sets of rankings from the 13-member CFP selection committee, which has faced the gnarliest puzzle of any of the 10 committees in the four-team playoff era. As it approaches its final rankings coming at noon Sunday, which will determine the four berths for the national semifinals at the Rose Bowl and the Sugar Bowl, the committee had a neat array for its penultimate list: four unbeaten teams in the Power Five and four once-beaten teams.Those eight teams, including No. 7 Texas (11-1) and No. 8 Alabama (11-1), maintain realistic hopes of appearing in the College Football Playoff.Georgia (12-0) held on to the top spot after its 31-23 win at Georgia Tech, while Michigan (12-0) nibbled just behind after winning, 30-24, over Ohio State in Ann Arbor. The Bulldogs have three wins over teams that remain in the rankings — No. 9 Missouri (10-2), No. 11 Mississippi (10-2) and No. 21 Tennessee (8-4). The Wolverines have two — over No. 6 Ohio State (11-1) and No. 10 Penn State (10-2).Moving up to No. 4 was a relief for Florida State, which won at Florida, 24-15, one week after it lost quarterback Jordan Travis to injury. The Seminoles play in the ACC championship game Saturday night against Louisville (10-2), which slid from No. 10 to No. 14 after it lost, 38-31, at home to Kentucky (7-5).Two of this week’s conference championship games feature battles from within the top eight: No. 1 Georgia vs. No. 8 Alabama in the SEC, and No. 3 Washington vs. No. 5 Oregon in the Pac-12. While Washington holds wins over Oregon, No. 15 Arizona (9-3) and No. 20 Oregon State (8-4), Oregon gained a first ranked victim when it beat Oregon State, 31-7, on Friday. The committee kept the Beavers among its top 25 teams because of the caliber of their conquerors over the past two weekends: Washington and Oregon.No. 22 Tulane (11-1) held down the top spot among the Group of Five and should clinch the coveted New Year’s Six bowl spot from that tier if it can win the American Athletic title Saturday at home against SMU (10-2). No. 24 Liberty (12-0) moved up a notch as it awaits a visit from New Mexico State (10-3) in the Conference USA title game.The full rankings:1. Georgia (12-0)2. Michigan (12-0)3. Washington (12-0)4.

Washington Post,The Caps are slumping on offense. They’re trying not to get frustrated.,2023-11-28 19:01:00,Bailey Johnson,"LOS ANGELES — Hockey players aren’t very good at hiding their frustration. On any given night in the NHL, players can be found smacking their sticks or the boards after a missed scoring chance or slamming the bench door after a less-than-ideal shift.The Washington Capitals are hardly immune from those difficult moments, and there have been a few instances this season when their frustration has bubbled over. But for the most part, they have maintained an even keel — even when they feel there’s nothing more they could have done.During Monday night’s 2-1 loss at lowly San Jose, Washington outshot the Sharks 34-23 and generated 60 shot attempts. But the Capitals’ lone goal was deflected twice before the puck found the net — it was far from the kind of highlight-reel tally many of Washington’s players are used to producing, and it was just the latest in a string of weak offensive outings that the Capitals have trudged through despite a strong start in the standings.“I think there’s been a lot of games throughout the year where they’re one-goal games and we just can’t seem to find the back of the net,” forward Connor McMichael said after Monday’s loss. “Tonight, I think we out-chanced them pretty heavily. We had a lot of great looks. We just couldn’t put the puck in the net.”There’s no question the Capitals are frustrated by their scoring woes. Coach Spencer Carbery is keenly aware of the delicate balance he has to strike between demanding more from his players and maintaining their confidence while many of them are in a slump.“Other than the actual work that goes into helping them accomplish the goal, which is [to] score, that’s the other part that’s the most difficult,” Carbery said. “Just managing guys’ demeanor and their confidence levels — when you don’t score, it starts to get in your head a little bit.”Entering Tuesday’s games, Washington (10-6-2) ranked second-to-last in the NHL in goals (42) and goals per game (2.33). The Capitals’ shooting percentage was 8.0, which also ranked 31st. Last season, the worst shooting percentage in the league was the Calgary Flames at 8.8 (while Washington ranked 18th at 9.9 percent), so mathematically the Capitals’ shooting luck should turn in their favor at some point.“That’s the game of hockey,” McMichael said. “Sometimes it’s just not going to go your way.”Carbery tries to remind his players of that fact, but he knows the message can begin to wear thin when a slump feels never-ending.“We try to focus on the positive and the process-related stuff, and I know that gets old at times,” Carbery said. “We’re doing the right things; it’ll go, it’ll go. ‘Carbs, you’ve told me that 12 times, and they’re still not going in for me.’ That gets old for them, but eventually they’ll go in. … Stay positive. Stay confident. Practice well. Score in practice. Those little things that we’ll continue to harp on our guys about — to stay confident in those moments.”Center Dylan Strome is the lone Capital with more than five goals. (He has eight.) Captain Alex Ovechkin has five — he hit the post on one of Washington’s best chances Monday — while McMichael, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Tom Wilson have four apiece. The Capitals’ issues with scoring are evident on their 32nd-ranked power play and at even strength, and it’s a theme they’ve had to discuss again and again.“That’s what we’re trying to work with our guys on,” Carbery said. “How do we create more [scoring opportunities], and then if we’re able to create more, good, but then how do we make good on the quality chances that we’re creating? How do we take advantage? It’s not an easy answer. It’s really, really difficult to score in this league. That’s why players get paid a lot of money to score goals. For whatever reason, our guys, throughout our lineup, have been really, really snakebit.”Washington is 9-0-1 when scoring three or more goals. It’s 1-6-1 when scoring two goals or fewer. It’s no secret to anyone with the Capitals that they need to score on a more regular basis if they’re going to consistently win, starting with Wednesday night’s game at the surging Los Angeles Kings.Until their luck turns, Carbery and his players will continue to look for ways to generate more scoring chances — and try to avoid frustration when the puck doesn’t go in.",4288,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/28/capitals-offensive-struggles/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,strike post tonight luck moment shot outshot shoot advantage loss capital demand ranked lineup center make slump forward great year level back thin outing feel spencer instance delicate part turn nhl connor heavily strome power late trudge strength hit calgary reason time offensive goal maintain focus bench game enter find balance tally start paid message continue alex angeles hockey actual shark smack discus dylan secret score easy coach aware carbs slam issue san bubble monday keenly found question wednesday carbery league ovechkin money win confident stick wilson produce night difficult percent attempt guy practice board confidence eventually captain begin kind strong washington string harp season work percentage frustration wear woe told generate keel lone despite give put evgeny remind regular stuff miss apiece pretty opportunity surge theme deflect mathematically stay weak positive answer head net jose hiding accomplish tom lowly kuznetsov play lot tuesday basis quality avoid player flame favor chance immune evident demeanor fact create consistently mcmichael manage puck frustrate,0.9831,0.1399253731343283,5.797928802588995,0.4897759563668655,0,2023-11-28
Washington Post,Sports Illustrated’s use of AI infuriates a staff already in turmoil,2023-11-28 18:27:00,"Ben Strauss, Will Sommer","A day after news broke that Sports Illustrated has been publishing AI-generated articles passed off as the work of writers who did not exist, the staff of the storied sports magazine gathered for a virtual all-hands meeting. Staffers were furious, according to people who attended who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal company business.The website Futurism reported Monday that SI, the glossy magazine that for decades was the gold standard for sports journalism, had produced consumer product reviews by artificial intelligence and bylined the stories by fake writers. One writer’s profile photo was available for purchase on an AI website, Futurism reported.SI withdrew the stories, but its parent company, the Arena Group, a media conglomerate that also owns Men’s Journal and Parade, disputed Futurism’s report. In a statement Monday, Arena said the articles were written by people for AdVon Commerce, a third-party company it had hired to produce e-commerce content. Only the authors’ names and bios were AI-generated, Arena said.By then, the jokes had already started. Pat McAfee devoted a segment to the story on his ESPN show. “Sports Illustrated’s like: ‘We can’t hire anybody. We don’t have the money,’ ” he said. “ ‘But what if we get 10 more writers? Think with me. Who are they? AI writers!’ ” Reporters said some of their sources jokingly asked whether the reporters were, in fact, real people.On Tuesday, during a meeting that was described as “contentious” and “tense” by two who attended, staffers asked for a full, transparent accounting of what happened. The meeting was hosted by Editor in Chief Steve Cannella, and top executive Ross Levinsohn joined 40 minutes after it started, the people said.The answers to questions Tuesday about the AI debacle, multiple staffers said, were unsatisfying and incomplete. Executives said that it was a one-time mistake with an AI company and that they had already broken off their relationship with AdVon before the Futurism story was published. But staffers thought higher-ups were ducking accountability in blaming AdVon, just as Levinsohn had done in an email sent to staffers Monday evening.“The articles in question were product reviews and were licensed content from an external third-party company,” Levinsohn wrote. “AdVon assured us that all of the articles in question were written and edited by humans.”Levinsohn and AdVon did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.Questions about AI are roiling journalism — how it will be wielded, the ethics behind it and what human work it might ultimately replace. At SI, the focus of staffers’ outrage was less existential — product reviews aren’t sports journalism — and more about yet another embarrassment that they said undermined their journalism.This, after all, is the same magazine at which a high school student was found to be covering the Cincinnati Bengals for SI’s network of affiliated sites, part of a strategy by the previous top executive at SI, James Heckman, to churn out content from cheaper writers — not to mention several rounds of layoffs and the SI-branded brain power pills that are trading on the magazine’s name.That sort of brand-devaluation overshadows the good journalism the outlet still does, staffers believe, including a recent scoop about former Michigan football analyst Connor Stalions by Richard Johnson and Tom Verducci’s baseball coverage, among other work.The root cause of the despair is a business model that staffers fear is irretrievably broken. The Arena Group pays $15 million per year for the rights to publish SI, in print and online, to a licensing company called Authentic Brands Group, which bought SI from its previous owner, magazine publisher Meredith. (More than 30 percent of the staff was laid off as part of that deal.)Authentic Brands Group retained the commercial licensing rights to SI, which it uses for things such as the newly launched Sports Illustrated resorts. Arena Group, meanwhile, starts every year $15 million in the hole with its SI budget and must generate most of its revenue from subscriptions and advertising, according to people familiar with the deal. Even documentary, audio and scripted TV licensing rights are controlled by Authentic Brands Group.That might explain the need for more content, however it’s generated.Staffers also have chafed at new article production goals, though they vary by writer. Still, multiple staffers called them draconian and said they don’t properly distinguish between a daily story and a deeply reported investigation. (“It’s like judging a baseball player by how many times he swings,” one reporter said.)Earlier this year, Levinsohn told staffers that the Arena Group owed tens of millions of dollars in a debt payment that was coming due, which staffers worried could threaten the magazine’s viability, two staffers said. That catastrophe was averted with a new investment from 5-Hour Energy founder Manoj Bhargava, according to those staffers.This isn’t the first time a media company has run into trouble over allegedly AI-generated reviews from AdVon. In October, staffers at USA Today’s e-commerce site noticed reviews that appeared to be AI-generated and published under fake bylines appearing on their site.Like Sports Illustrated, USA Today owner Gannett claimed the posts weren’t generated by AI. Instead, a spokeswoman insisted the fake names were pseudonyms for humans who wrote the articles through a contract with AdVon.",5486,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/28/sports-illustrated-ai-articles/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story script news ethic run strategy company furious steve viability host pass hole post source artificial tense hire gather print journal trading review mcafee dispute storied real brand worried illustrate espn year undermined reporter existential draconian retain deal medium cincinnati trouble fear manoj outrage part embarrassment analyst include connor bhargava minute affiliate jokingly debacle heckman accounting site million power avert ultimately student request virtual johnson baseball statement spoke stalions pill familiar laid transparent gold time goal writer staffer due distinguish mention edit insist focus devote today website pseudonym consumer irretrievably start accord threaten chafed intelligence contract call football executive newly claimed author pat withdrew ten report discus richard bylined external assure purchase available segment october profile authentic journalism accountability energy monday meeting sport happen gannett pay wield found revenue budget photo usa contentious write question mistake layoff full outlet duck anonymity email founder money broke allegedly instead network high michigan produce percent license fake owe coverage payment replace believe attend launch brain parent school advon parade notice unsatisfying model documentary comment daily magazine judging sort publisher relationship work tv publishing licensing verducci cannella investigation ross incomplete standard told debt swing generate cover editor commercial advertising online business production futurism bylines james former scoop despair spokeswoman exist blame bengal joke investment publish deeply product answer audio show tom catastrophe previous commerce levinsohn decade meredith tuesday bought described round respond churn conglomerate resort arena subscription player control earlier cheaper roil glossy join broken group chief multiple explain content recent fact owner internal bios human day condition staff properly article top root vary dollar overshadows,-0.99075,0.0546846518410499,10.325193260654114,0.395283389450056,0,2023-11-28
Washington Post,"D.C. United’s new GM has a massive task ahead. ‘It’s part of the allure,’ he says.",2023-11-28 16:53:00,Steven Goff,"Ally Mackay, D.C. United’s new chief soccer officer and general manager, is from Outer Hebrides, a ribbon of islands off northwest Scotland. It’s close to a three-hour ferry ride across the Minch to the mainland and an hour-long flight to Glasgow, a megalopolis compared to Point, his speck of a hometown on Isle of Lewis.He ventured to the University of Evansville in Indiana to play soccer and worked as a player agent based in Orlando before joining Nashville SC’s front office ahead of its 2020 inaugural season in MLS.Suffice to say, Mackay knows a little about going great distances to meet objectives.In accepting United’s four-year contract offer two weeks ago, he has embarked on another long journey: rehabbing an organization that has fallen from MLS aristocracy to afterthought.His responsibilities include hiring a head coach, installing a winning culture, identifying and acquiring players, integrating the youth academy with the first team and setting the course after four years without a playoff berth, eight without a playoff victory and 19 since winning its fourth MLS Cup title in the league’s first nine seasons.“I have broad shoulders. I can handle it,” he said in an interview Tuesday. “It’s part of the allure. The easy thing for me would have been staying in Nashville. You want to try in any aspect to push yourself.”His personal journey, he says, has fed into his hunger to succeed professionally.“I’m from a small island originally. So to get to this point, you understand the challenges at each stage in your life,” he said. “This is another challenge, but it’s a challenge that really excites me, and I wouldn’t have taken it if I didn’t really think we can be successful.”At 37, Mackay is one of MLS’s youngest decision makers after serving as an assistant GM in Nashville. He has no time to waste. With about six weeks until training camp opens, United needs to replace Wayne Rooney, whose 1½-season coaching tenure ended last month.Decisions on contract options are due this week. The free agent market will open soon. The international marketplace beckons.Mackay will, in essence, take the reins from Dave Kasper, who was reassigned to senior consultant after overseeing the player personnel department with a variety of titles for more than 20 years.Kasper is “going to be in the room when we’re making decisions, but it’s going to be Ally’s show,” chief executive Jason Levien said. “It’s an injection of new energy, of new ideas. We have got to capitalize on it. It’s great to feel that way. It’s another thing to get the kind of results we want to get.”United hasn’t had a general manager since Lucy Rushton was fired after the 2022 season. Rushton reported to Kasper; Mackay will report to Levien and co-chairman Steve Kaplan.“I’m letting [Mackay] drive the bus, so I’m excited to hear what he generates — his thoughts, his ideas, his perspective,” Levien said. “I really want Ally to put his fingerprints all over who the next coach is going to be and how that’s going to work.”Mackay (pronounced Mack-EYE) said he is in the early stages of the search but hopes to initiate interviews next week and extend a contract offer by Christmas. He will consider domestic and foreign candidates, though a familiarity with MLS’s player-acquisition rules and other wrinkles is a plus.“There’s a number of elements that make a lot of people interesting,” Mackay said. “We’re not tied down to anyone right now.”He said there will need to be “collaboration and alignment” with Levien and Kaplan.“I can have my opinions, and so can Jason,” Mackay said. “Ultimately, he’s the owner, and he has to feel good about it as well.”The most prominent candidate from MLS circles is Bruce Arena, the winningest coach in U.S. men’s soccer history who began his pro career with United in 1996 and had two stints leading the U.S. national team.In September, Arena resigned after four-plus years as New England’s boss following a league investigation into his use of “insensitive and inappropriate remarks.” Details were not made public.Arena, 72, would need to petition MLS Commissioner Don Garber to work in the league again.Asked whether he would consider Arena, Mackay called his success “obviously historic” and said United is “assessing all options.”“I don’t think we’ve ruled anyone out yet or anyone in,” Levien added.During the process of hiring Mackay, Levien said, he solicited opinions from candidates and observers alike in the soccer world to assess the D.C. organization. The feedback wasn’t always pretty.“It was that we were a little bit dated in our approach, that maybe we didn’t have fresh ideas and weren’t aggressive in our thinking and making decisions, and that we’ve missed on a lot of players,” said Levien, whose group purchased United’s operating rights in 2012. “We’ve missed on building a winning culture that has the highest expectations.“We’ve gotten a lot of the foundational pieces right,” Levien said, citing Audi Field, which opened in 2018, and Inova Performance Complex, a two-year-old training center in Leesburg. “But we haven’t gotten the talent identification right.”Levien — who, like Mackay, is a former player agent — said he was drawn to Mackay because of his work in helping build expansion Nashville from the ground up. The Tennessee club has qualified for the playoffs in each of its four seasons and signed players, such as 2022 MLS MVP Hany Mukhtar, a German forward, via Danish club Brondby.United has one opening for a designated player, a category for high-end talent whose salary falls outside normal guidelines. Striker Christian Benteke, the scoring leader, and midfielder Mateusz Klich, the assists leader, are expected to return. The team must decide whether to reacquire playmaker Gabriel Pirani, whose loan from Brazilian club Santos expires soon.“The current roster is one that has shown quality,” Mackay said of a team that was on a playoff path before fading down the stretch. He said he had a “really good conversation” with captain Steven Birnbaum, the longtime center back, about club leadership and what lies ahead.",6094,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/28/ally-mackay-dc-united-new-gm/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point stage leader international steve accept nashville levien ribbon opinion orlando commissioner excite hire bit united resign excites mainland handle make outer center gm reassign forward sign great oversee year designate back feel result rein element originally circle assistant part island kasper dave include small consultant path close observer ground klich aggressive ultimately isle acquire waste history personnel mateusz serve team distance detail ally time identification due rooney youth drive interview northwest officer course hany agent long decide pronounce pro variety operating garber contract call executive fading personal ass report expires bruce field meet wayne familiarity easy score current purchase coach tie indiana organization sc foundational decision approach set energy succeed search venture idea hometown fed petition injection fire inova office extend lucy glasgow feedback allure complex open challenge market fall flight league opening domestic university number free danish roster responsibility rule perspective audi hear category ferry broad win tennessee prominent date foreign expect manager tenure essence high drawn interest fresh integrate instal brazilian replace ahead performance option aristocracy captain birnbaum soccer inaugural qualify piece stint begin understand inappropriate kind christmas fingerprint stretch bos front shoulder speck early collaboration offer season england national reacquire work base life training initiate longtime maker solicit building candidate investigation insensitive berth benteke identify ago loan christian santos conversation pirani steven mukhtar academy leesburg scotland victory hunger young put mackay gabriel winning general assist normal former german miss room megalopolis salary build consider fourth world rushton stay lead midfielder alignment head show return embark assess aspect follow evansville expansion jason marketplace play hebrides lot minch journey alike tuesday quality wrinkle mvp playoff success arena senior player camp career playmaker week rehabbing cup generates club leadership compare join group chief capitalize lie hope september ml historic department talent culture title ride owner process guideline bus striker push,0.9942,0.0,7.772556634304205,0.4036752731395588,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Tiger Woods says he’ll ‘walk away’ from golf when he no longer believes he can win,2023-11-28 12:34:00,Ben Church,"Tiger Woods says he’s only prepared to walk away from playing golf when he no longer believes he can be competitive as he insisted that’s currently not the case.The 15-time major winner has not played a tournament since his early withdrawal from The Masters in April, but will tee off as the Hero World Challenge tournament host at the unofficial PGA Tour event in Albany, The Bahamas, on Thursday.“I love competing, I love playing,” Woods told reporters ahead of his highly-anticipated return to competitive golf.“I miss being out here with the guys. I miss the camaraderie and the fraternity-like atmosphere out here and the overall banter.“But what drives me is that I love to compete. There will come a point in time, I haven’t come around to it fully yet, that I won’t be able to win again. When that day comes, I’ll walk.”Woods underwent ankle surgery in May after enduring “constant” pain across his three rounds at Augusta National during the Masters the previous month, only his second competitive appearance of 2023.It’s the latest in a long-list of physical issues that have troubled Woods, including severe leg injuries suffered in a car crash two years ago.While confirming the operation to fuse his ankle earlier this year was successful, Woods said that his recovery took its toll.“It’s six months of doing nothing,” reflected Woods. “That’s the hard part. The first couple months were really rough,” he said.“Unfortunately I’ve had experience, I’ve gone through it before and I’m here on the good side now.”The 47-year-old Woods has prioritised appearances at the four major championships in his sporadic competitive appearances in recent years.Looking ahead, he told reporters that the best and most realistic scenario for 2024 is to compete in one tournament per month.Started in 2000 and staged as a benefit to Woods’ TGR Foundation, the Hero World Challenge has been a tournament in which the golf icon has previously staged comebacks to the game.An invitational field of 20 players will feature in this year’s edition, all competing for the $4.5 million prize money purse.Woods has been partnered with fellow American Justin Thomas for his return, with the pair due to tee-off at 11.52 a.m. ET on Thursday.Woods insists he still believes he can win the tournament, but does admit that while his ankle is better, he still feels pain in other parts of his body.“My game feels rusty, I haven’t played in a while,” he said.“I’m excited to compete and play and I’m just as curious as all of you are to see what happens because I haven’t done it in a while.”In August, Woods was named as the sixth player director on the newly-formed PGA Tour policy board. The move gave the players a one-seat advantage after the controversial merger in June between the PGA Tour and Saudi-backed LIV Golf.When asked about the shock announcement, Woods said he had been “frustrated” that players were not consulted beforehand.“I would say that my reaction was surprised, as I’m sure a lot of the players were taken back by what happened so quickly without any input or any information about it, it was just thrown out there,” he said.“I was very surprised that the process was what it was. We were very frustrated with what happened and we took steps going forward to ensure that [players] were not going to be left out of the process like we were.”Woods also said he had “faith” in PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, who came under fire for his involvement in the proposed merger, but insisted not consulting players “can’t happen again and won’t happen again.”Earlier this year, Monahan admitted the announcement had been “ineffective” and, as a result “there was a lot of misinformation.”“I think anytime you have misinformation that can lead to mistrust, and that’s my responsibility. It’s nobody else’s responsibility – that’s me and me alone,” Monahan said in August.“As I’ve said, I take full accountability for that. At the same time, I apologize for putting players on their back foot.”Woods was generally happy with how things had evolved since joining the board, but admitted to being frustrated by how long certain governance changes had taken to occur.Woods also warned that the December 31 deadline for the proposed framework was “coming up very quickly.”“We have multiple options, but still, we would like to have a deal done on December 31st,” he added.“That’s what the agreement said in the summer and all parties understand that, but there are other options out there.”",4486,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/sport/tiger-woods-golf-return-hero-world-challenge-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hero bahamas point involvement suffer partner mistrust insists host information jay golf withdrawal commissioner excite advantage american faith december forward year reporter back feature prepared feel deal result master agreement tee part liv include severe quickly million change late announcement sixth atmosphere camaraderie scenario time walk due unofficial insist admit april propose fuse prioritise drive game merger operation prize evolve physical reflect long ensure fully input side move previously love troubled pair generally field tiger realistic successful crash summer issue event accountability august pain happen fire framework endure competitive full challenge winner responsibility money month longer thrown win pga left couple rusty played invitational thomas guy surgery leg board controversial party currently believe ahead fellow stag away policy option misinformation hard understand happy early compete monahan national june step albany appearance edition director told justin tournament give augusta put rough experience tour shock ineffective foundation miss injury world comeback major lead governance return car deadline benefit previous play lot round championship apologize underwent unfortunately player earlier reaction tgr join consult constant multiple curious recovery anytime surprised recent wood confirm process warn day icon frustrate sporadic ankle,0.99015,0.1337494427106553,7.923680175246442,0.4795374931581827,0,2023-11-28

CNN,Chicago Bears score late field goal to defeat Minnesota Vikings as Joshua Dobbs is intercepted four times,2023-11-28 07:05:00,Ben Morse,"The Chicago Bears’ season has had more downs that ups, but with over half the campaign gone there are signs of promise for 2024-25.The latest came on Monday night when a stellar defensive display and a late field goal was enough to help Chicago beat the Minnesota Vikings 12-10 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis.It wasn’t pretty – the Bears didn’t score a touchdown all game and relied on the boot of Cairo Santos in the victory, including the 30-yard with 10 seconds remaining to clinch the win – but the team will take all the positives it can get as it looks towards the future.Bears quarterback Justin Fields’ second game back from injury wasn’t necessarily a classic, but he continues to show glimpses as to why he can be trusted as the team’s long-term No.1.He finished with 217 passing yards – 114 of which went to his favorite wide receiver DJ Moore – as well as 59 rushing yards. Importantly, he also helped orchestrate the fourth-quarter drive which led to Santos’ game-winning field goal.Fields was supported by an excellent defense, one which intercepted Vikings quarterback Joshua Dobbs four times. In the last two games, the defense has now had eight takeaways while this was the Bears’ third game this season with three or more interceptions.With the team holding the Carolina Panthers’ first-round pick in next year’s draft, following a blockbuster trade which culminated in Carolina drafting Bryce Young earlier this year, Chicago also holds the No. 1 overall pick as well as the fourth pick in 2024.Afterwards, Fields praised the camaraderie in the dressing room, in particular after his two self-confessed “backbreaking” fumbles.“First off, can’t fumble. Need better ball security on that,” Fields told reporters. “Guys never wavered, so the guys in the locker room, I appreciate them for sticking beside me and believing in me.“The defense did a great job by getting the ball back for the last drive and the offense did a great job executing those plays, so it felt great.”Vikings quarterback Dobbs has enjoyed somewhat of a renaissance in 2023.Entering the season as an unheralded back-up, he completely reorientated his NFL career during a stellar stint with the Arizona Cardinals before being traded to Minnesota weeks ago to replace the injured Kirk Cousins.The 28-year-old has continued his gun-slinging way of playing with the Vikings, earning himself a new nickname: “The Passtronaut.”However, Dobbs came down to earth on Monday with his four-interception performance. Although he could argue at least one wasn’t fully his fault – and he did connect with his tight end T.J. Hockenson for a 17-yard score for the only touchdown of the game – it was a sobering evening for the signal-caller and one which means he has turned the ball over six times in two straight defeats for Minnesota.After the defeat, Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell would not commit on whether Dobbs would remain as the team’s starter. Dobbs himself, meanwhile, said he could not focus on a coaching decision.“I just focus on myself, focus on how I can help this team win, focus on how I can be a better teammate, a better quarterback and focus on how I can make sure the offense is in the right play based on the scenario to go out and execute and play at a high level,” Dobbs told reporters.",3294,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/sport/chicago-bears-minnesota-vikings-mnf-nfl-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,teammate culminate execute dj joshua win yard classic boot defensive stick high quarterback renaissance night draft finish moore guy ups sober appreciate replace believe rely make ball sign enjoy passing earn tight great year performance reporter orchestrate level rush excellent back glimpse reorientate locker campaign connect takeaway stint turn touchdown nickname include clinch earth arizona season waver base minnesota job bank display late ago santos told felt camaraderie promise beat team blockbuster scenario remain dobbs cardinal kirk hold victory time stadium goal viking justin young necessarily importantly focus game drive panther trust chicago fumble room injury pretty praise fault fourth half continue security hockenson argue fully positive lead show head field connell pick defense follow score nfl play coach commit straight unheralded career earlier intercept week kevin bear backbreaking carolina favorite completely particular dress monday defeat continued starter injured support trade wide cairo stellar offense bryce receiver,0.9942,0.1821493624772313,9.428171701112872,0.4328840222957869,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Cristiano Ronaldo asks referee to overturn penalty decision given to him during Asian Champions League game,2023-11-28 06:09:00,George Ramsay,"Cristiano Ronaldo told a referee to overturn a penalty awarded in his favor during Al-Nassr’s Asian Champions League game against Persepolis.The act of sportsmanship occurred in the second minute of Monday’s match as Ronaldo was brought down in the box, prompting referee Ma Ning to award a penalty to the home side.But the Portuguese star approached the referee and argued that the decision should be reversed. Ma subsequently went to the pitch-side monitor and ruled out the decision.The game ultimately finished 0-0 after Al-Nassr’s Ali Lajami was red carded early in the first half for a late challenge on Milad Sarlak.From then on, the Iranian side looked the more likely to find a winner in Riyadh, ending the game with 12 shots to Al-Nassr’s six.Ronaldo did have a chance to add to his three Asian Champions League goals this season early in the second half, but he fired a shot just wide of the post.However, a draw was enough for Al-Nassr to reach the knockout stages of the competition with the Saudi Arabian side winning all of its first four games.Persepolis, meanwhile, will be hoping to finish as one of the best runners-up in order to qualify for the knockouts.",1176,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/sport/cristiano-ronaldo-penalty-decision-spt-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,stage home rule win saudi game reach red knockout ronaldo find iranian half shot draw champion finish argue award portuguese brought side reverse card match occur sportsmanship subsequently act penalty lajami overturn qualify referee cristiano ning order decision asian riyadh favor minute early milad chance season star approach add monday ultimately late told prompt monitor fire wide challenge box goal league winner arabian competition hop,0.9374,0.0,10.40073732718894,0.3412037037037037,0,2023-11-28
CNN,"‘I have frozen my penis,’ says Swedish cross-country skier Calle Halfvarsson after racing in icy temperatures",2023-11-27 11:44:00,George Ramsay,"Swedish cross-country skier Calle Halfvarsson experienced an unusual but not unheard-of consequence of competing in icy temperatures in Finland at the weekend.After taking part in the 20-kilometer World Cup event in Ruka, Halfvarsson said that he had to take shelter in the warmth after sustaining a frozen penis.According to Reuters, temperatures dropped to a chilly five degrees Farenheit (-15 degrees Celsius) at the start of the race.“I have frozen my penis. For real,” Halfvarsson told Swedish outlet Expressen. “Damn, I had to lie in there [the athletes’ tent] for 10 minutes to warm it up. It hurts so damn much. It’s terrible.”Halfvarsson has suffered the same injury before, Expressen said, but thankfully the 34-year-old was able to see the funny side this time around, adding: “It’s lucky that I’m about to have my second child because it’s going to be difficult in the future if I’m going to continue like this.”Norwegian Jan Thomas Jenssen topped the podium at Sunday’s race, ahead of Czech Republic’s Michel Novák in second and teammate Harald Østberg Amundsen in third. Halfvarsson was the first Swede across the line in 18th.Cross-country skiers, who normally compete in skin-tight racing suits and thin under-layers, can be particularly susceptible to chilly extremities.At the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Finland’s Remi Leindholm suffered from a frozen penis and needed to apply a heat pack to the affected area at the end of the 50km mass start race. Leindholm, like Halfvarsson, had also previously experienced a frozen penis while competing in Ruka.Asked by Expressen if he could describe the sensation, Halfvarsson said: “No. Those who know, they know. But here’s a tip from me. Stay away from it, because it is the worst thing you can experience.”Prince Harry also revealed in his autobiography that he was suffering from a frostbitten penis at his brother William’s wedding to Kate Middleton following an expedition to the North Pole in 2011.",1971,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/sport/calle-halfvarsson-frozen-penis-skiing-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231127093322-calle-halfvarsson-112523.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,expressen frozen prince wedding østberg describe ruka swedish line beijing harry icy apply sensation lie reuters start tent compete norwegian lucky swede stay child halfvarsson remi race republic sunday warmth damn thomas funny autobiography reveal cup injury told skier podium calle minute continue topped away particularly chilly heat expedition world novák side winter real event amundsen suit jenssen unusual difficult thankfully warm william sustain shelter olympics kate michel brother celsius teammate follow hurt consequence mass frostbitten pack drop penis finland ahead previously czech area farenheit time athlete part experienced middleton leindholm tip outlet suffer affected susceptible jan thin temperature north add future harald pole degree,-0.78495,0.15220700152207,8.899999999999995,0.5451923076923078,0,2023-11-27

He is very young but also very mature. We were all very happy for him.

CNN,France beats Gibraltar a record 14-0 in Euro 2024 qualifier,2023-11-19 09:41:00,Aimee Lewis,"It was a night that will live long in the memory for France fans as Les Bleus thrashed 10-man Gibraltar by an astonishing 14-0 in their European Championship qualifying match, with Kylian Mbappé scoring a hat trick.This was the world’s No. 2-ranked team playing against a country ranked 198 in the world and the gulf between the two was evident on the pitch.It was the biggest winning margin in the history of the qualifiers, surpassing Germany’s 13-0 thumping of San Marino in 2006, and marked the first time a European team had scored 14 goals in a World Cup or European Championship qualifying match, according to Reuters.Mbappé’s long-range effort to complete his hat trick was the pick of France’s goals in the Allianz Riviera, Nice, on a night where seven goals were scored in each half.Warren Zaïre-Emery, aged 17 years, eight months and 11 days, also made history as he became France’s youngest player since 1914 and marked his debut with a first-half goal.The night started badly for Gibraltar when Ethan Santos put the ball into his own net after just three minutes and from there on things unraveled for the visitors as Santos was shown a red card in the 18th minute for a foul on Zaïre-Emery, which ended the teenager’s participation.Marcus Thuram, Jonathan Clauss, Youssouf Fofana, Adrien Rabiot, Ousmane Dembélé all scored for France, while Olivier Giroud and Kingsley Coman got two goals apiece.“Being down to 10, already with 11 it’s complicated for them, but it doesn’t take away the credit for us even if we could have been more efficient, it’s as much about respecting the opponent as scoring goals,” France manager Didier Deschamps said, per Reuters. “Fourteen is not bad.”France had 39 attempts on goal, 19 of which were on target, while Gibraltar failed to muster a chance.France, already qualified for Euro 2024 in Germany, is top of Group B while a winless Gibraltar is bottom on zero points without having yet scored a goal during qualification.",1970,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/19/sport/france-gibraltar-14-0-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231119084221-01-france-gibraltar-mbappe-1118.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,winless rabiot debut thuram ranked jonathan net nice match allianz ball attempt night memory reuters start card complete play teenager accord fofana effort championship santos margin pick top complicate giroud efficient red evident olivier cup manager muster bleu qualify minute kingsley goal thrash away ousmane dembélé youssouf big world fail day clauss astonish age point month young bottom adrien year qualifier san european player b ethan unraveled win france euro visitor coman live kylian credit germany mbappé opponent put fourteen country didier team time respect surpass trick badly long group deschamps zero show score gulf thump marked foul marino qualification make riviera target history gibraltar,0.92345,0.0,9.211518324607326,0.4542222222222222,0,2023-11-19
CNN,Luis Díaz’s father released by Colombian guerrilla group,2023-11-09 13:47:00,Matias Grez,"The father of Liverpool soccer star Luis Díaz, who was kidnapped by a Colombian guerrilla group last month, was released on Thursday and handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the Catholic Church in Valledupar, Colombia, according to Colombia’s Episcopal Conference.“We thank God for the release of Mr. Luis Díaz!” the conference posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.“With him already are Mons. Francisco Ceballos, bishop of Riohacha, and Mons. Héctor Henao, delegate for Church-State relations, who formed the humanitarian commission in charge of facilitating his release.”Ceballos was on board a UN-funded helicopter that picked up Díaz’s father, Luis Manuel Díaz, from a forest area along the Colombian border with Venezuela.The UN said its political mission in Colombia worked closely with the Colombian government, the Catholic Church and the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group to release Díaz Sr.“We were involved in his handing over from the ELN into his freedom,” UN Secretary-General spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said following a question from CNN’s Caitlin Hu. “We, along with the church, were in charge of the actual operations, so we used our helicopters, our planes.”Dujarric added that Díaz’s father was taken to one of the UN’s regional offices in Valledupar in the northeast part of Colombia, where he was reunited with his family.Díaz Sr. and his wife, Cilenis Marulanda, were kidnapped by armed men from the ELN on motorcycles at a gas station in Barrancas, the family’s hometown in northern Colombia, on October 28.Marulanda was rescued later that same day, but a major police and military search operation had been ongoing in an attempt to find Díaz Sr.Díaz played and scored for Liverpool on Sunday and pleaded for the release of his father after the Premier League match against Luton Town.On Tuesday, the ELN said that Colombian military operations were not allowing the release of Díaz Sr., with the guerrilla group saying in a statement that they were trying “to avoid incidents with official forces,” referring to the presence of military troops in an undisclosed area.Soon after the news of his father’s release, Díaz was named in the starting lineup for Liverpool’s Europa League match against Toulouse on Thursday night in France.“We are delighted by the news of Luis Díaz’s father’s safe return and we thank all those involved in securing his release,” the club said in a statement.The Colombian government’s Peace Delegation and the ELN both welcomed the release of Díaz’s father.In a statement on Thursday, the delegation thanked the police and military, as well as the United Nations verification mission in Colombia and the Episcopal conference, for their help with Díaz Sr.’s release.“We hope he regains peace of mind soon, changed by a deed that should never have occurred,” the delegation’s statement read.“Kidnapping is a crime that cruelly violates human dignity, causes immense suffering to families and communities, and violates the humanity of the kidnapped person in their deepest intimacy.”The delegation added that the kidnapping has “plunged” the ongoing peace talks with the ELN “into a critical situation,” and at the next meeting, it will demand that all current ELN captives “be released in conditions of safety and dignity immediately.”Those demands were repeated by Colombia’s Ombudsman Carlos Camargo Assis, who called on the ELN and “all illegal armed groups” to release all kidnapping victims currently being held captive in the country, noting that there had been 79 kidnappings so far this year.In addition, the Colombia Football Federation thanked all of the forces “that made possible the release of Luis Manuel Díaz, father of our player Luis Díaz.”",3743,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/09/sport/luis-diaz-father-released-eln-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180703124829-claudia-rebaza-profile-photo.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,ceballos

CNN,Luiz Díaz begs for release of kidnapped father after scoring stoppage-time equalizer for Liverpool,2023-11-06 05:40:00,George Ramsay,"Liverpool player Luis Díaz has pleaded for his kidnapped father to be released back to his family in Colombia.Díaz made the appeal hours after coming on as a substitute and scoring a late equalizer during Liverpool’s 1-1 draw against Luton Town on Sunday.Last week, a delegate for the National Liberation Army (ELN), a Colombian rebel group, said that they have Díaz’s father, Luis Manuel Díaz, captive and will release him “as soon as possible.”“Every second, every minute, our anguish grows; my mother, my brothers and sisters and I are desperate, anxious and without words to describe what we’re feeling,” Díaz wrote on X, formerly Twitter, after the Premier League game.“This suffering will only end when we have [my father] back home. I beg that they [the ELN] release him immediately, respecting his integrity and ending this painful wait as soon as possible.“In the name of love and compassion, we ask that you reconsider your actions and allow us to recover him.”Díaz’s mother, Cilenis Marulanda, was also kidnapped from a gas station in the family’s hometown of Barrancas, located in Colombia’s northern La Guajira region, but later rescued.A major police and military search operation for Díaz’s father is ongoing.The 26-year-old forward traveled back to Colombia after his parents’ kidnapping and returned to the UK ahead of Liverpool’s game against Luton.In the fifth minute of stoppage time, not long after being brought on as a second-half substitute, Díaz headed in Liverpool’s equalizer from Harvey Elliott’s cross.He celebrated by paying tribute to his father, lifting his top to reveal an undershirt with the words “Libertad para papa” – “Freedom for dad.”In his statement on X, Díaz added: “I ask the ELN for the prompt release of my father, and to all the international organizations that they get involved for his freedom.”After the game, Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp said that the goal was “wonderful,” “emotional,” and “fantastic” for Díaz, but added that “the real problem is not sorted.”He continued: “I think the signs from Colombia are rather positive, optimistic, but the one thing we all want to hear, it didn’t happen yet.”Tahith Chong had given Luton the lead at Kenilworth Road before Díaz’s late goal, finishing off an excellent counter-attacking move.The draw moved Liverpool up to third in the Premier League table, while Luton climbed out of the relegation zone to 17th.",2408,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/06/sport/luiz-diaz-father-kidnapping-liverpool-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231106100338-01-luis-daz-110523.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,problem barrancas describe move rebel chong police word desperate army brought luis pay optimistic reconsider region liberation tribute operation grows forward premier díaz compassion major parent relegation captive action kidnapping uk finish top game father guajira sister wonderful happen freedom hour elliott mother celebrate reveal manager twitter formerly gas hometown lead international harvey national minute goal family appeal cilenis excellent positive undershirt hear week beg sign locate luton fantastic equalizer draw military search real papa involve climbed player liverpool feel klopp northern wait recover give zone anxious write x brother immediately anguish lift integrity head statement painful back delegate ahead marulanda return jürgen manuel respect time plead eln colombia continued kidnap stoppage long suffer group league colombian score late tahith prompt home travel emotional substitute road kenilworth make organization town station table release add love libertad,0.96435,0.0,8.479835728952768,0.5045454545454546,0,2023-11-06
CNN,Coco Gauff convincingly beaten by Jessica Pegula in all-American WTA Finals tie,2023-11-05 05:52:00,Aimee Lewis,"Coco Gauff’s bid to become the first teenager since 2004 to win the WTA Finals ended in defeat after she was convincingly beaten by fellow American and doubles partner Jessica Pegula in the semifinals.Fifth seed Pegula took just an hour to complete a 6-2 6-1 win over the 19-year-old US Open champion in Cancún, Mexico.“I managed to get my act together at the end of the year,” Pegula told reporters. “I’ve done a good job of resetting coming here.”“I found a way to make it work,” she added. “I’m feeling confident going into the finals.”Pegula will play either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or second seed Iga Świątek in the final. That semifinal was suspended after three games on Saturday because of rain and will resume on Sunday, meaning the final has been moved to Monday.Sabalenka or Świątek will meet a player who has yet to lose a match in Cancún, reaching the final with a 4-0 record and with three of those wins coming against higher-ranked opponents.Her victory over Gauff was her second in three meetings against her compatriot. The 29-year-old played the testing conditions – there were rain breaks in the second set and a swirling wind throughout – better than her opponent, breaking Gauff six times and making just 11 unforced errors (Gauff totalled 25 unforced errors).According to the WTA, Gauff would have become the first teenager since Maria Sharapova in 2004 to win the tournament. A 17-year-old Sharapova defeated Serena Williams in the final that year.“It’s probably my biggest final ever,” Pegula said. “It’s going to give me a lot of confidence going into next year.”Gauff and Pegula will be back in action on Sunday, competing together in the doubles for a place in the semifinals. Their round-robin match against Laura Siegemund and Vera Zvonarava was suspended on Friday with the Americans leading 6-3 1-1.",1834,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/05/sport/coco-gauff-jessica-pegula-wta-finals-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200226162421-represented-logo-no-background-large-169.jpg?q=h_120,w_748,x_0,y_0/w_1280",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lose meaning świątek sabalenka move double resume error work match place job played manage siegemund seed probably coco test compete complete play teenager action zvonarava confidence game sunday hour tournament gauff bid reach set break found beaten confident fellow lead told iga partner reporter compatriot big lot world champion laura serena year condition player feel friday win williams give maria suspend act meeting unforced meet back swirl wind rain cancún american opponent time defeat aryna semifinal open record wta pegula sharapova convincingly reset saturday make jessica final victory add vera total,0.90495,0.163576881134133,8.587899159663863,0.4583333333333334,0,2023-11-05
CNN,Coco Gauff advances to the semifinals of the WTA Finals despite conceding 17 double faults in match,2023-11-04 09:56:00,Issy Ronald,"Coco Gauff advanced to the semifinals of the WTA Finals with a hard-fought victory over Wimbledon champion Markéta Vondroušová on Friday, despite conceding 17 double faults during the match.The 19-year-old completed an impressive comeback to defeat Vondrousova 5-7 6-7 (7-4) 6-3 and became the first teenager to reach the last four of the tournament since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009, setting up an all-American showdown against her doubles partner Jessica Pegula.The Czech had the better of the early exchanges and engineered herself into a match-winning position, serving for victory in the second set, but Gauff held her nerve and sent the set into a tiebreak.“I felt like I needed to hit through the court,” Gauff said afterwards, according to Sky Sports. “She’s a very tricky player. When you play her pace and let her move you side to side, it’s tough. And I played her, it’s my third time, so I know that.”Windy and rainy conditions in Cancún, Mexico forced several delays in play and influenced Gauff’s strategy too, she said afterwards.“In the wind, it’s tough to be as aggressive as you want, because the bounces are weird and the ball was moving,” she said. “So I’m glad I made that adjustment and didn’t get too frustrated when I missed. You pay the price for hopefully a good reward.”Victory ensured that the current US Open champion became the first American teenager to tally more than 50 wins in a single season since Venus Williams in 1999, according to the WTA.Meanwhile, Aryna Sabalenka also advanced to the semifinals of the tournament on Friday with a 6-2 3-6 6-3 win over Elena Rybakina after a match that was halted the day before because of a rain delay.If the Belarusian defeats Iga Świątek in their semifinal, she will secure the year-end world No. 1 ranking.Świątek secured her semifinal spot by defeating Ons Jabeur 6-1 6-2 while Pegula won all three of her matches in the round-robin group stages to set up a showdown against Gauff.",1960,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/04/sport/coco-gauff-wta-finals-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200226162421-represented-logo-no-background-large-169.jpg?q=h_120,w_748,x_0,y_0/w_1280",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,nerve windy weird engineer caroline influence świątek sabalenka move single double tally venus secure match pay played ball fault elena halt jabeur coco showdown teenager complete play accord held impressive tough sky tournament gauff reach set exchange spot adjustment bounce iga concede partner position glad comeback markéta world day champion tricky side rainy strategy force condition ensure player wimbledon friday vondrousova belarusian win williams stage current vondroušová early felt serve despite aggressive wind rain cancún american czech time court advanced defeat aryna season pace hit group frustrate semifinal mexico wozniacki price open wta pegula make jessica rybakina final delay miss victory sport,0.93355,0.0,8.683550913838118,0.4112244897959183,0,2023-11-04
CNN,"Daniil Medvedev booed off the court, Novak Djokovic eases through and scheduling chaos at the Paris Masters",2023-11-02 12:49:00,not specified,"After Carlos Alcaraz’s surprise exit on Tuesday, world No. 3 Daniil Medvedev also faced a shock second round defeat at the Paris Masters, losing in three sets to Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday.In Medvedev’s first match of the tournament after receiving a first round bye, the 2021 US Open champion saved six match points before falling in a tense outing in front of a volatile crowd that appeared to get under the Russian’s skin on multiple occasions.After Dimitrov took the first set 6-3 and with the score locked at 5-5 in the second, Medvedev threw his racket before stepping up to serve. This prompted boos from the Parisian audience, which the 27-year-old clearly did not appreciate.Medvedev is no stranger to playing the villain on court and walked back to his bench, refusing to play until the booing stopped.An argument with umpire Renaud Lichtenstein – and the crowd – ensued, before he was eventually given a code violation for delaying the match and was forced into serving.“When I got the code, I was like: ‘Do I really want to get disqualified and finish the match on this note?’ So I just went on to play,” Medvedev told the media after the game.Despite the disruption, Medvedev managed to level things up and won the second set tie-break to send the match to a deciding final set.The pair battled to another tie-break as world No. 17 Dimitrov squandered six opportunities to put Medvedev away. The 32-year-old eventually sealed the victory at the seventh time of asking, winning 6-3 6-7 7-6 and moving on to the round-of-32 where he will take on Alexander Bublik.Medvedev was again jeered as he left the court and appeared to raise his middle finger towards the crowd on his way out, something which he later denied.“I just checked my nails, like this,” he said to reporters post-match. “No, really, it’s nothing more than that. Why would I do that to this beautiful crowd in Paris-Bercy?”Meanwhile, 24-time grand slam singles champion Novak Djokovic breezed into the third round in straight sets, beating Tomás Martín Etcheverry 6-3 6-2.Djokovic had not played since representing Serbia in the Davis Cup in September, but showed no signs of rust against the Argentine and appears increasingly likely to end the year as world No. 1.With Medvedev and Alcaraz both suffering earlier-than-planned exits, Djokovic’s path to a 40th Masters title may have just gotten slightly easier.Meanwhile, Paris Masters tournament organizers have come under criticism following Jannik Sinner’s withdrawal from the event on Thursday, saying he hadn’t been allowed enough time to prepare due to the way his matches had been scheduled.According to Eurosport, Sinner’s match against American Mackenzie McDonald was scheduled to take place during the night session on Wednesday, but the players did not take to the court until after midnight.Sinner emerged victorious in three sets with the match ending at 2:37 a.m. local time on Thursday.The 22-year-old Italian was then scheduled to face Alex de Minaur during Thursday’s day session at 5 p.m., only 14 hours after leaving the court.“I’m sad to announce that I’m withdrawing from today’s match here in Bercy,” Sinner posted on his Instagram story and X, formerly Twitter, profile. “My match finished at nearly 3am this morning, meaning I didn’t get to bed until a few hours later.“I had less than 12 hours to rest and prepare for my next match. I have to do what I believe is best for my health and body.”The world No. 4 also added that he would now focus on preparing for his upcoming ATP Finals and Davis Cup matches.After Thursday’s schedule was released, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) and the ATP Tour have faced criticism from fans and players alike.“Bravo @atptour, way to help one of the best players in the world recover and be as ready as possible when he finished his previous match at 2:37 am this morning,” former world No. 2 Casper Ruud posted on X. “14.5 hours to recover…what a joke.”Three-time grand slam champion Stan Wawrinka echoed Ruud’s concerns in a reply to his tweet.“It’s crazy, tournament doesn’t care and ATP just follow what the tournament will want! Always the same story…” Wawrinka wrote.The Professional Tennis Players Association, which was co-founded by Novak Djokovic and Vasik Pospisil, posted on X: “It’s more important than ever for players to have a unified voice to address challenges like match scheduling.”CNN has reached out to the FFT and the ATP Tour for comment.",4465,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/02/sport/daniil-medvedev-paris-masters-novak-djokovic-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231102070224-01-medvedev-dimitrov-paris-masters-1101.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,local stranger casper emerge association bulgarian title bye argentine step federation code serbia place played night alex profile minaur reply jannik former finish concern session boo tournament september russian set criticism lichtenstein comment save organizer umpire possible volatile pospisil stan nail send ensue alexander believe walk battle health champion sign cnn sad round skin note left player vasik wednesday challenge recover give audience x alcaraz decide follow serve announce french back jeered beautiful front checked slightly eurosport unified fall put american seventh defeat crowd exit mackenzie withdraw daniil suffer mcdonald professional open novak rest bench martín final delay release add lock tense breeze due disqualify lose italian medium meaning disruption move raise echoed single represent match bercy surprise manage dimitrov thursday ready post pair slam play tomás villain shock hour seal sinner squander reach parisian level cup tuesday twitter fft formerly straight wawrinka renaud told address racket eventually reporter away leave tour refuse beating path finger world point day increasingly bravo event focus year force violation prepare upcoming story win carlos victorious grand opportunity atp threw argument schedule tennis today booing crazy medvedev davis middle ruud rust voice time court morning important show score grigor multiple atptour bed prompt withdrawal etcheverry previous master paris djokovic victory receive instagram,0.0484499999999999,0.0671892497200448,9.071064814814813,0.3409356725146199,0,2023-11-02
