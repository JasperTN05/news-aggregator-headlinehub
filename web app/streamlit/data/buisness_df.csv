CNN,2023 was an ‘extinction’ level year for tech startups. Where did all the money go?,2023-12-07 16:23:00,Nicole Goodkind,"Startups are not having a good 2023. And the investors who handed out billions of dollars to fund them aren’t very happy about it.During more flush years, venture capitalists, angel investors and billionaire evangelists poured their cash into tech startups – the easy money pipe was seemingly open to any Tom, Dick or Harry who had an idea and was willing to attach a buzzy phrase like ‘blockchain’ or ‘AI’ to it. Valuations soared and unicorn companies, those startups said to be worth $1 billion or more, proliferated.But now, with high interest rates, an uncertain economic environment and a banking crisis that hit Silicon Valley-adjacent banks hard, there’s been a shortage of funds for early-stage companies and a lack of opportunity for late-stage companies to cash out.For investors looking to maximize their money, better opportunities exist elsewhere.In this environment, money sitting in less risky money markets tends to pay better than high-risk startups. The Bloomberg US Aggregate bond index, a widely-tracked benchmark for the performance of US investment-grade bonds, logged a 4.5% return in November. That’s the index’s best monthly performance since 1985.The risks are high with a startup. Sure, tech titans like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are doing just fine – but their younger siblings are struggling to stay afloat.So, why would a potential investor stick their neck out for a tech startup when they can get paid to sit on cash instead?Venture capital funding for startups across the globe has fallen by more than half since last year, according to new Pitchbook data – the annual fundraising figure for 2023 is pacing towards its lowest level since 2015.With a lack of both funds and exit opportunities (that’s when shareholders are able to cash out by selling a bunch of stock through an acquisition, IPO, buyout or merger), early stage companies are unable to get started and late stage companies are falling into distress. When a company is private, opportunities to sell shares tend to be fewer and farther between.So far this year, nearly 20% of all startups have raised money at a lower valuation than they had previously, according to equity management company Carta. That’s up from 5% in 2021.More startups have shut down in the third quarter of 2023 since Carta began tracking the data almost five years ago. So far this year, 543 startups on Carta’s platform have shuttered.The carnage is so bad that some insiders are calling this an extinction-level event for startups.Some of these firms had previously raised a lot of money. Big names like WeWork, which raised $11 billion in funding, and freight startup Convoy which brought in $900 million, have both filed for bankruptcy in the past two months.Other companies are still holding out, but they’re at a standstill while shareholders hope they can ride out the storm and cash out at a later time. Through the first half of the year 2023, people received about $12 billion from 588 separate corporate exits. The full-year figure is now on track to come in as the lowest of the decade, according to the report.“An immense amount of capital remains trapped in late-stage and venture-growth-stage startups hesitant to gamble on whether their financial performance can withstand the intense scrutiny of the public markets,” found a PitchBook report.What comes next: Venture capitalists are sitting on a record amount of “dry powder” (that’s capital that’s been committed but still waiting to be invested) according to PitchBook.And while startup funding and exit strategies may remain tight for the next year, analysts say that there are some promising signs ahead.AI and biotech funding still remain relatively strong, wrote Allan Parks, manager at private equity platform Allvue, in a recent note. Initial public offerings are slowly picking back up and the venture scene in Europe is “witnessing some promising fundraising activity,” he added.Still, he said, “for venture capital managers and investors, 2023 was a wild ride – and not necessarily in a good way,”",4058,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/investing/2023-was-an-extinction-level-year-for-tech-startups-where-did-all-the-money-go/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1368649213.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,farther funding biotech raise lot fall november quarter share index record hesitant cash return back maximize public angel distress remains amount track half firm silicon annual economic flush benchmark strong slowly ride withstand startup shortage valuation gamble company phrase banking open struggle start receive allan storm write decade level unable shareholder happy remain wework wait dick file risky tom attach neck financial allvue stock begin accord equity fundraise globe platform alphabet event dry witness potential capital ipo acquisition late past bond stage corporate private figure million pace sign scene idea young market bank unicorn ago immense soar exist pick performance uncertain year hard lack blockchain tech found intense billionaire sibling buyout relatively scrutiny amazon interest carta bunch rate dollar bankruptcy titan bloomberg stay europe shut hand merger sell monthly insider crisis early instead opportunity paid recent pitchbook commit tight analyst investor environment data park easy microsoft standstill promising pipe risk convoy powder low worth freight evangelist manager high buzzy big carnage note pay aggregate wild fund activity stick previously money venture management hold time capitalist brought hit invest initial tend seemingly harry exit apple fine offering hope strategy necessarily separate billion call trap,0.03195,0.2217841301133563,10.193165562913904,0.4010270505508601,0,2023-12-07
CNN,What to expect from Friday’s jobs report,2023-12-07 09:41:00,Alicia Wallace,"Employers are growing more cautious, pulling down some job postings and reining in hiring. Employees are sticking around more and not bouncing as readily for better opportunities.Welcome to the wait-and-see job market.Some of those holding patterns are being reflected in the federal jobs reports that have shown employment growth remaining historically strong but moderating to a mere shadow of the blockbuster gains seen in the early years of the pandemic economic recovery.In October, US employers added a net 150,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate inched up to 3.9%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.A similar story likely played out last month but with an added boost from striking autoworkers and actors returning to the workforce (and BLS’ tallies).Economists, by consensus, are expecting Friday’s jobs report, set for release at 8:30am ET, to show employment growth of 180,000 positions and for the jobless rate to hold steady at 3.9%, according to Refinitiv.“We’re expecting to see moderate growth,” Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn’s chief economist, told CNN in an interview. “And if our own data is any predictor, we’re actually thinking that it’s going to be a slightly underwhelming number.”If November’s job gains come in as expected, that rate of growth would be in line with what was seen during the decade before the pandemic. From 2010 to 2019, a period that included a record-setting 100 months of job growth, about 183,000 jobs were added per month on average.Economists had anticipated 180,000 jobs last month as well, but the October total fell short of estimates by 30,000 jobs.“Some of the weakness last month may have been illusory, just due to the strikes,” Julia Pollak, chief economist at online job site ZipRecruiter, told CNN.The United Auto Workers union, in an unprecedented and successful action, went on strike against the Big Three automakers of Ford, General Motors and Stellantis from mid-September through the end of October.October’s employment report included 33,200 jobs counted as lost in the motor vehicles and parts industry. BLS attributed those declines to strike activity: The agency’s strike report for that month counted 25,300 Ford, GM and Stellantis workers on strike.Additionally, the BLS strike report for November indicated that strikes ended for 16,000 SAG-AFTRA workers after the actors union and Hollywood studios reached an agreement in the early part of last month.Friday’s report could give more clues about whether the labor market is getting back into a more balanced and steady state, or whether it’s cooling more sharply than previously thought. On Wednesday, ADP’s private payrolls report showed a modest net gain of 103,000 jobs and slower wage gains, a smaller total than the 130,000 economists expected.While a lot of attention, deservedly, will land on Friday’s topline payroll and unemployment numbers as well as wage gain estimates, data revisions could also prove telling, Pollak told CNN.“For the last 10 months or so, jobs numbers have been revised downwards by an average of over 30,000,” she said. “If we see more downward revisions, then I think many people will conclude that the labor market is even weaker than it looked initially and is cooling quite rapidly.”Still, job gains remain historically strong and job cuts aren’t necessarily spiking but remain higher than they have been in the past decade.In November, US employers announced 45,510 job cuts, according to data released Thursday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That’s a 24% increase from October but a 41% drop from a year before, when tech companies were slashing jobs after bulking up during the pandemic.Year-to-date, companies have announced plans to make 686,860 job cuts, according to the Challenger report. Outside of 2020, that’s the highest January through November total since 2009, when 1.24 million cuts were announced.First-time claims for unemployment benefits, considered a proxy for layoffs, ticked up to 220,000 for the week ended December 2, according to Department of Labor data released Thursday.Also, while first-time claims for unemployment benefits remain low, Labor Department data also indicates that people are staying unemployed for longer.Continuing claims, filed by people who have received at least one week of unemployment benefits, have steadily marched higher in recent weeks and hit a yearly high of 1.925 million in mid-November. As of November 25, they dipped to 1.861 million.While that exceeds the historically low continuing claims seen in 2019, it remains well below longer-term averages.“There is no cumulative deterioration yet in the labor market that has caused previous Fed Chairs to pivot quickly from rate hikes to rate cuts to support the economy,” wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist with FwdBonds, in a note Thursday. “The weekly jobless data will keep the Fed on the sidelines watching carefully with the risks of doing too much or too little roughly balanced. Continuing unemployment claims looked more worrisome last week, but now it looks like a seasonal adjustment problem was responsible for the surge in the number of recipients.”He added: “Jobless claims are back in the soft landing camp for now, but for how long?”Although it’s settling in to a time of more modest growth, the US labor market is well poised for an eventual pickup.“It’s very much being held back by high interest rates,” said Pollak, noting the effects of inflation-battling monetary policy tightening. “Talk to any property investor and they say they’re not building because of high borrowing costs and low valuations … talk to manufacturers, and despite the various incentives and despite the huge amount of spending on factories, hiring is not really growing.”As such, many investments are not going to reach their potential until rates come down, she said. The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark lending rate to the highest level in 22 years in a monthslong battle to bring down inflation.“Employers are saying that they hope and expect business activity to pick up in the back half of 2024,” she added. “The unstated assumption there is that inflation will continue to come down, and the Fed will be able to start cutting rates.”",6222,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/november-jobs-report-preview/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206161431-people-with-briefcases-stock-120623.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,slow bulking karin initially employment raise lot increase november short back return layoff huge continue line manufacturer pull settle christopher remains amount revise jobless fwdbonds long half vehicle assumption lose economic reserve agency monetary blockbuster similar interview benchmark strong rupkey pattern exceeds christmas valuation company bureau illusory effect start receive sharply labor responsible weakness property write borrowing inched told cost cnn unemployed decade level release remain studio ticked reach adp conclude roughly wednesday file total economist story department strike consider automaker accord due pivot factory benefit worrisome fed poise cumulative potential worker past cautious slash small drop historically october estimate yearly net anticipate gm private set motor million indicates fell weekly action downward growth talk site market unprecedented clue period pick friday workforce attribute bring rein year weaker boost posting claim cool payroll held tech report december predictor january deterioration interest steady despite reflect rate quickly spike readily number inflation average auto moderate surge proxy make gray camp stay employer chief spending sideline policy ford tally stellantis expect eventual early steadily ziprecruiter hire plan successful online carefully recent wage industry united bounce shadow seasonal support previous chair month investment economy job land investor add part data deservedly kimbrough soft pandemic building monthslong pollak week state risk hike low union bls decline high big consensus note position federal include grow dipped julia underwhelming lending linkedin general activity stick attention revision previously give played challenger prove balance employee indicate announce hold time cut thursday hit hollywood slightly problem show agreement unstated tighten count watch autoworkers hope battle adjustment march necessarily incentive business modest topline actor unemployment,0.96545,0.0482160077145612,10.624125326370756,0.4323817966903073,0,2023-12-07
CNN,Retail investors are sitting out the stock resurgence,2023-12-07 07:17:00,Krystal Hur,"This year’s stock rally is back on course, but not everyone is on board.The S&P 500 index in November notched its best monthly performance this year, snapping a three-month streak of steep losses as Wall Street became optimistic that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates. The revival in stocks, though off to a bumpy start in December, has been broad in reach, pulling up shares of everything from small caps to cyclical stocks.Among the chief catalysts for the rally are swooning US Treasury yields. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note fell to 4.12% on Wednesday, well below the 5% it topped in late October, according to Tradeweb.The glut of cash on the sidelines is “poised to fuel a significant rally in risk assets, offering investors an opportunity to potentially capitalize on improved sentiment and market dynamics,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in a note on Monday.But analysts say that retail traders aren’t jumping into the stock market and might not anytime soon. Cash is still king for many.The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement index for November, a measure of retail investor sentiment, revealed that the company’s clients were net sellers of stocks last month despite the market’s recovery. The index also recorded its lowest monthly reading since May.“A lot of retail investors are just happy to not participate right now,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.There is a record $5.84 trillion parked in money market funds as of November 29, according to Investment Company Institute data. About $2.25 trillion of that cash is in retail money market funds.While institutional investors are starting to pick at stocks poised to do well if the economy reaccelerates — explaining the rally’s widening breadth — retail traders are taking a more conservative approach, especially after seeing steep declines in their portfolios during last year’s sell-off, says Mulberry.Plus, yields are still at attractive levels compared to recent years, when low interest rates meant that cash offered little return for investors.Staying out of the stock market action and betting instead on fixed income is paying off for investors. The Bloomberg US Aggregate bond index, a widely-tracked benchmark for the performance of US investment-grade bonds, logged a 4.5% return in November. That’s the index’s best monthly performance since 1985.“Next year, [we’re] looking at a lot of uncertainty and volatility,” including the Fed’s rate trajectory and concerns about a possible recession, said Mulberry. “I think a lot of retail investors will just continue to sit on the sidelines.”The sell-off in the oil market accelerated Wednesday, with US crude prices sinking below $70 a barrel for the first time since July, reports my colleague Matt Egan.The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.Gas prices bottomed out at $3.10 a gallon in late December last year just before Christmas. The national average hasn’t been below $3 since May 2021.US crude tumbled to as low as $69.11 a barrel on Wednesday, the lowest intraday level since June 29. Oil closed at $69.38 a barrel, down 4.1% on the day. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 3.8% to $74.25 a barrel.Analysts said the sell-off is being driven by a confluence of factors, including concerns about soft demand in China, record-setting supply from the United States and disappointment over last week’s OPEC+ decision.“The market has fallen off quite rapidly,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. “It could really be interpreted as OPEC+ losing its ability to control prices.”Read more here.McDonald’s has a burger strategy to spark growth in the next few years. That strategy can be boiled down to one word: More.“In the US, in a number of markets, around the world, having a larger burger is an opportunity,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNN in an interview.“We’re working on that,” he added. “That is something that you should expect in the future.”It’s not just more burger in your burger. It’s more everything, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.The burger chain plans to open thousands more restaurants. It wants to add 100 million members to its loyalty program, which nudges customers into spending more. And it’s investing in more marketing campaigns to get people craving its burgers and fries — and, increasingly, chicken sandwiches, too.McDonald’s has already been working on a plan to improve how its burger tastes. But it’s learned that in addition to softer buns and gooeyer cheese, people also want a more sizable burger.“We’ve listened to our customers. And we understand their desire for larger, high-quality burgers that fill you up,” said Jo Sempels, who oversees markets where McDonald’s has licensed its brand, during an investor event on Wednesday.Read more here.",4969,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/investing/premarket-stocks-trading-retail-cash/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190624171745-20190624-before-the-bell-logo-large-169.png?q=h_83,w_390,x_0,y_0/w_1280/h_80",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,danielle raise lot fall november brian share index record trillion back cash return continue glut pull anytime addition broad trader improve suggest confluence lose close firm large ceo reserve strategist benchmark compare kempczinski revival consult china sempels disappointment christmas sandwich offer company loyalty attractive open mcdonald streak start day gas cyclical write meant told course level cnn happy demand learn reach bet wednesday fix colleague global trajectory explain stock notch cap accelerate increasingly accord event oil king fed poise late sinking price listen small bond reaccelerates nudge october topped reveal net measure supply significant interpret gooeyer customer million uncertainty fell td action growth international market gallon institutional wall tumble national taste pick performance shah year p understand loss client member report driven december chain volatility sizable interest despite intraday rate associate snap june program bodes crude number oversees treasury average brent zacks bloomberg crave factor chief spending sentiment sideline possible bun reading july sell brand monthly desire expect concern instead opportunity plan recent united bottom work license campaign chris widen movement president month investment economy analyst investor add ameritrade data park soft swoon cheese boil week state participate risk barrel marketing restaurant street recovery yield seller low wave ability retail control decline manager seema portfolio note fuel consumer word breadth pay federal aggregate include fund rapidly lipow burger catalyst money world management income time asset invest especially conservative spark potentially principal offering dynamic matt rally thousand closer optimistic steep fry mulberry andy capitalize fill strategy jumping approach chicken institute softer read bumpy recession,0.9756,0.0603743207888911,9.487839831401471,0.422933201058201,0,2023-12-07
CNN,"From the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church, an upcoming Supreme Court ruling may mean some victims won’t see their day in court",2023-12-07 06:00:00,Samantha Delouya,"On Monday, the US Supreme Court grappled with one of the highest-profile bankruptcy cases the court has taken on in decades.The case hinges on the legality of OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s multibillion-dollar bankruptcy plan ­— which would have the Sackler family, who once owned the pharmaceutical giant, personally pay up to $6 billion to victims of the opioid crisis, including state governments, local governments, Native American tribes and individuals, in exchange for the family’s legal immunity from future civil lawsuits. The deal would also mean the family would not have to admit any guilt or wrongdoing related to allegations that the Sacklers were complicit in aggressively marketing OxyContin and downplaying its highly addictive properties.But the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision in this case may affect much more than the Sackler family’s fortune. Third-party releases, the provision that would allow the Sacklers to be shielded from additional civil lawsuits, have become an increasingly popular device by organizations accused of mass harm, recently including the Boy Scouts of America and scores of Catholic dioceses in the United States.According to Nicole Langston, a bankruptcy scholar and assistant professor of law at Vanderbilt University Law School, provisions shielding third parties from legal liability have become a “matter of course” in many corporate bankruptcy proceedings. Proponents of third-party releases say they’re the quickest and fairest way for victims to receive compensation for harm done by a company or other organization. Those who oppose the provision say it’s a way for potentially liable parties to skirt legal scrutiny, possibly weakening consumer protections.The Sackler family has said it would not agree to the multibillion-dollar settlement without being shielded from current and future liability due to the thousands of additional civil cases it would inevitably have to settle or fight in court. The US Trustee, which serves as a watchdog over bankruptcy cases, has argued that the deal is an “abuse” of the bankruptcy system.Those who agree with the US Trustee argue that third-party liability releases prevent individuals harmed by a company from getting their day in court.“The bankruptcy system is set up to try to find an orderly way for a company to pay off its creditors, including people who might have lawsuits against that company,” said Adam Zimmerman, a professor of law at the USC Gould School of Law. “These third-party releases involve situations where it’s not just the company going through the bankruptcy that is getting that kind of immunity on the other side, it’s someone else who has contributed funds… who is now trying to get the benefits of the bankruptcy.”A recent draft paper, co-authored by Zimmerman, argues that “approving the Sackler releases, or doing so without clear guardrails to prevent abuses to the rule,” would embolden even more solvent companies to use bankruptcy to resolve mass injury claims. “It would result in less information production… less due process, and fewer opportunities for plaintiffs to make their stories heard,” according to the paper.Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy agreement was reached after years of lawsuits against the company and its owners over their alleged role in the skyrocketing number of opioid addictions since OxyContin entered the US market.The Supreme Court hearing comes at a time of devastating losses due to drug overdoses in the United States. From 1999 to 2021, nearly 645,000 people died from an opioid overdose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.While Purdue’s bankruptcy deal was approved by more than 95% of victims, the US Trustee has argued that bankruptcy court cannot bind the 5% who voted “no” into a deal that does not allow them to pursue legal action against the Sacklers.“You can imagine that there are people with a different view of the case. Maybe they’ve lost a family member and they don’t see money as any real form of justice for them,” Langston said. “For them, it’s not a fair deal.”Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family have maintained that the bankruptcy agreement would be the best deal for victims. During oral arguments, the justices heard from an attorney representing some of the victims of the epidemic who stressed that if the court rejects the agreement, an onslaught of civil suits against the Sacklers from states and individual victims would result in very little compensation for any party.“Whatever is available from the Sacklers — whether that’s $3 billion, $5 billion, $6 billion, $10 billion — there are about $40 trillion in estimated claims. As soon as one plaintiff is successful, that wipes out the recovery for every other victim,” the attorney, Pratik Shah, said in response to a question from Justice Brett Kavanaugh.But Langston said a ruling in favor of Purdue could “open up this floodgate of nonconsensual third-party releases.”“You could imagine that consumers of everyday products or medicine might be concerned about a potential lack of care or recklessness or negligence of some of these third parties. If the bankruptcy court allows these type of deals, they can just write away their liability,” Langston said. “As consumers, we should be wary of that.”Legal experts will likely pay close attention to the Supreme Court’s decision in the Purdue Pharma case, said Anthony Casey, a law professor at the University of Chicago Law School and director of the school’s Center on Law and Finance.“My take is that it’s the biggest bankruptcy case to go to the Supreme Court in 30 or 40 years. It’s huge,” he said.But the Purdue case is not the only high-profile mass-harm case making its way through the US court system, and several other organizations have turned to bankruptcy courts to shield individual executives and other third parties from added legal trouble.One such organization is the Boy Scouts of America. The youth program filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020 amid claims by thousands of men who say they were abused as children by Boy Scout troop leaders, and the plan went into effect in April. The agreed-upon $2.4 billion settlement also includes provisions that protect multiple parties from additional civil lawsuits. Those third-party releases, and potentially the entire settlement, would be jeopardized through a potential court appeal if the Purdue case were to be struck down by the Supreme Court, Casey said.While such agreements are controversial, Casey said he doesn’t see how else a deal would work in this instance.“There’s just no way to get a deal. No insurer is going to put money into the settlement unless they know it’s resolving the lawsuits,” Casey said. Without third-party releases, the crush of litigation and insurance claims would mean “assets get liquidated, and the organization ceases to exist,” he added.In recent years, the Catholic Church and other religious organizations have also faced a torrent of lawsuits related to allegations of sexual abuse. Multiple dioceses in the United States have filed for bankruptcy with provisions for third-party liability releases.In a Supreme Court filing, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops expressed support for Purdue’s bankruptcy structure, arguing that “in exchange for a release from liability on claims of alleged abuse, Catholic parishes, schools, and other diocesan entities contribute significant sums to a common fund, maximizing the recovery for abuse claimants and relieving them of the struggle to recover in piecemeal litigation.”Casey said companies like DuPont and 3M, which are beginning to face a crush of lawsuits for PFAS — also known as “forever chemicals,” that have allegedly contaminated drinking water, food and soil across the country — are watching for the Supreme Court’s decision in the Purdue case.“That’s just getting started. That’s not in bankruptcy now, but whether they would or wouldn’t end up in bankruptcy, they have to be watching this,” Casey said.CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to reporting.",8037,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/purdue-pharma-supreme-court-bankruptcy/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-12-03t095812z-1093845698-rc2kp4agyfcd-rtrmadp-3-usa-court-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy.JPG?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country allegation contaminate heard available enter claimant response chicago insurance argues trillion huge argument watchdog maximize resolve settle solvent owner mass kind side american expert liquidate troop drinking lose scout langston close pursue contribute type appeal diocese trustee compensation argue vanderbilt rule chemical personally abuse view inevitably disease proceeding religious company system open effect represent draft struggle maintain matter assistant receive start law put deal allege day soil express amid write insurer course release multiple immunity america executive child harm embolden april school reach file church forever story negligence guilt begin devastate local increasingly accord structure due proponent sackler information benefit paper jeopardized wary entity sum common usc prevent potential wrongdoing role medicine estimate recklessness purdue current corporate significant set boy adam wipe university possibly action form litigation agree relieve upcoming concerned diocesan skirt center imagine turn overdoses casey sexual filing accuse weaken fight exist skyrocket civil dupont shah year devan quick nicole lack claim loss provision controversial away related member result water clear scholar leader sacklers scrutiny victim pratik torrent liable zimmerman struck piecemeal nonconsensual recover bankruptcy addiction case justice program liability number ruling bind crush complicit party fair make addictive court downplay cole exchange professor favor crisis gould supreme popular opportunity parish plan successful recent united family opioid admit situation work bishop recently allegedly support giant legal brett pfas question add overdose attorney different orderly stress serf find grapple highly conference reporting state approve floodgate marketing recovery decision control legality native food oxycontin injury big fortune aggressively monday entire consumer guardrail vote future affect process pay protect include catholic fairest director fund real suit attention government money pharmaceutical youth device individual shield involve score time asset additional cease tribe creditor potentially hinge agreement onslaught watch thousand oppose plaintiff settlement oral hearing epidemic anthony billion product pharma chapter reject everyday lawsuit organization,-0.21815,0.1119820828667413,10.780706521739129,0.4248751560549313,0,2023-12-07
CNN,Germany’s stock market just hit a new record high despite a faltering economy. What gives?,2023-12-07 05:35:00,Anna Cooban,"Germany’s benchmark stock index opened at an all-time high Wednesday as investors’ growing confidence that interest rates will soon be cut outweighs worries that the country may be suffering a recession.The previous day, the DAX closed at a record high of 16,533 points — only for that peak to be beaten Wednesday when trading began. The index closed 0.7% higher on the day at 16,656 points, a new record high.The index, comprising the 40 most valuable companies in Europe’s biggest economy, has been climbing more or less steadily since late October. At the end of that month, official estimates showed that inflation in the 20 countries using the euro had slowed sharply, hitting its lowest level in more than two years.Price rises — which had forced the European Central Bank into an unprecedented cycle of interest rate hikes — eased further in November, reaching 2.4%.Investors’ expectations that borrowing costs would not be raised again got a boost on Tuesday, when ECB board member Isabel Schnabel effectively ruled out further hikes, citing a “remarkable” fall in inflation. Schnabel told Reuters that the central bank is on track to bring inflation down to its 2% target, which makes “a further rate increase rather unlikely.”Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said the DAX had been buoyed by “good news on inflation,” noting that investors now expect the ECB to start cutting rates as early as March.Recent business surveys that suggested Europe’s economy may be bottoming out have also lifted the index, she said in a note.A closely watched survey of purchasing managers, which tracks the eurozone’s manufacturing and services sectors, showed Tuesday that output had contracted at a slower pace in November than the previous month.Still, the stock market gains are at odds with the fragile state of the German economy, which has been underperforming other large regional economies such as France, Italy and Spain. Germany’s gross domestic product shrank by 0.1% in the third quarter, compared with the previous three-month period.In the latest sign of the country’s troubles, provisional official data showed Thursday that industrial production in Europe’s manufacturing powerhouse dipped 0.4% in October compared with September in the fifth straight month of declines.“This makes it increasingly likely that the German economy will also contract slightly in the fourth quarter,” Ralph Solveen, senior economist at Germany’s Commerzbank, wrote in a note, chiming with other economists.Such a contraction would mean the country is already in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of declining output.And, on Wednesday, official data showed that industrial orders in Germany fell 3.7% in October from the month prior, confounding economists’ forecasts for a slight rise.German companies have also “significantly reduced their investment plans” for this year and next, according to a survey of 5,000 firms by the Ifo Institute published Monday.“The investment climate has deteriorated noticeably. This is the result of higher financing costs, weak demand, and uncertainty regarding economic policy,” Lara Zarges, economic expert at the institute, wrote in a press release.Ben Ritchie, head of developed market equities at investment company abrdn, offers one explanation for the divergence between the DAX and the German economy. The exposure of the index’s constituents to the domestic economy is “modest,” he told CNN.He also cited falling energy prices “supporting profitability,” as well as lower overall inflation, as additional reasons for the index’s strong recent run.Wednesday’s gains on the DAX were led by Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, whose stock closed 5.4% higher.The day before, the company said an independent audit of a plant it jointly owns with SAIC Motor in China had found no indications of forced labor. Volkswagen has faced criticism over the factory in Xinjiang, a region where human rights groups have documented the use of forced labor.

CNN,China’s real estate crisis is coming for its massive shadow banks,2023-12-07 05:17:00,Laura He,"Moody’s surprise downgrade of China’s credit outlook this week has reinforced concerns that the crisis in the country’s real estate market is spilling over into the wider economy.While the risk of contagion — particularly via losses at so-called shadow banks — is growing, analysts say China is not experiencing a ”Lehman moment,” a reference to the 2008 real-estate linked collapse of the bank that marked a major worsening of the global financial crisis.Even so, investors outside of China should pay attention, says Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, because of the impact on the country’s growth.“The current property downturn has been the biggest drag on the Chinese economy over the past couple years, and also the biggest tail risk at this moment,” he said, referring to something that is unlikely to occur but could still happen.Of particular concern is the spillover effect on the “shadow banking sector,” a mysterious and enormous part of China’s financial landscape.The industry, worth about $3 trillion at its narrowest definition and as much as $12 trillion if asset management products and consumers loans are included, has come under the spotlight in recent months because two major players have failed to make payments they owe to investors. Both of them have significant exposure to the property market.Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, one of the country’s largest financial conglomerates, declared itself insolvent last month after missing payments on dozens of investment products. The company is now at the center of a criminal investigation by the police.Two weeks after Zhongzhi revealed its financial troubles, China’s state media reported that Wanxiang Trust, an investment and asset management firm in Hangzhou, had delayed payments worth several hundred million dollars on a number of investment products.The problems at the two investment companies have fuelled fears about the risk of financial contagion from the worsening property market downturn on investors who did not directly purchase homes. Huge developers such as Evergrande and Country Garden have defaulted on their debt.“Shadow banking generally represented a significant source of capital for real estate developers, and the implosion of private developers is now rocking the shadow banking sector,” said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.Shadow banking refers to financial activity that takes place outside the traditional banking system.In the West, it often involves lending by private equity firms or hedge funds. In China, it involves different forms of financing activity, some of which include banks. Common forms of shadow banking include the use of wealth management products, trust products or entrusted loans.Silvers said the problems affecting shadow banks likely aren’t restricted to Zhongzhi or Wanxiang, adding “a wider meltdown [in the industry] seems imminent.”On Tuesday, shortly after the announcement by Moody’s, S&P Global Ratings also warned that spillovers from China’s real estate industry could reverberate across the economy, either through losses for banks and other financial institutions or through negative effects on investor and consumer sentiment.The shadow banking industry, broadly defined, reached $12 trillion in total size, accounting for 86% of China’s GDP in 2019, according to a report published by the country’s top banking regulator, which was also the first government report on the opaque sector.Trust firms, which pool savings to provide loans, were one of the fastest growing segments in shadow banking during the past decade. The industry has been a popular way for cash-hungry property developers and local governments to raise funds from millions of Chinese.By the end of 2022, assets held by trust firms totalled 21 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion), an eightfold increase from 2010, according to the China Trustee Association.Defaults on trust investment products, especially those linked to real estate, have increased over the past two years. In 2022, real estate trust defaults totalled 93 billion yuan ($13.1 billion), up slightly from 91.7 billion yuan ($12.9 billion) in 2021, according to Chinese data provider Use Trust.Zhongrong International Trust, which is partially owned by Zhongzhi, invests about 10% of its funds in real estate, according to the company. It has lent money to several struggling property developers, including Evergrande Group and Sunac China, which have also defaulted on their debt.Wanxiang Trust also has a sizeable exposure to real estate, with 58% of its assets under management in the sector. One of its troubled trust products invested in Kaisa Group, which defaulted on its debt in 2021 and currently faces a winding-up petition in a Hong Kong court.The liquidity crunch at trust firms may cause turmoil in the local bond market and put financial pressure on Chinese companies and local government entities.Trust firms may need to sell more liquid assets in their portfolios, such as corporate bonds and local government bonds, to prepare for the repayment of trust products coming due, Citi analysts said in an August note.“This could trigger a bond price correction and hinder companies’ financing access,” they said.That could potentially leading to debt-servicing challenges or even default pressure for companies or certain local government financial vehicles that face maturing debt payments in the near term, they added.Local government debt in China has soared largely due to a sharp drop in land sale revenues because of the property slump, as well as the lingering impact of the cost of imposing pandemic lockdowns.Data from the International Monetary Fund showed China’s local government debt reached 92 trillion yuan ($12.9 trillion) in 2022, up 50% from 2019.Among those liabilities — so-called “hidden debt,” which is usually concentrated in local government financial vehicles and do not appear on government balance sheets — might have amounted to almost $10 trillion, according to an October analysis by research firm Mars Macro.China’s shadow banks may be mired in problems, but they’re unlikely to cause a wider banking crisis, according to experts, as they are still a small part of the banking system.“In my view, the recent woes in the shadow banking sector will not lead to a systemic crisis, mainly because the formal banking sector has very limited exposure to these trust companies,” said Hu.﻿“Moreover, trust products are mainly sold to high net wealth investors, not ordinary people,” Hu said.According to Chinese regulations, individuals qualified to invest in trust products must have a minimum net worth of three million yuan ($421,793) or average annual income of no less than 400,000 yuan ($56,239) in the previous three years.Trust assets represented only 5.3% of the banking industry’s assets in the first quarter of 2023, according to CNN calculation based on data from the China Trustee Association and the People’s Bank of China.Trust firms have also been reducing their exposure to the property market. Property trust investments stood at 1.13 trillion yuan ($159 billion), accounting for 5.3% of total trust investments and 0.3% of the banking system’s assets, in the first quarter of this year. The amount was down 28% from the same period last year.“The [contagion] risk is manageable because the trust industry’s property exposure has dropped significantly,” said Ming Tan, director at S&P Global Ratings, adding that he doesn’t believe trust defaults will trigger a banking crisis because wealthy investors and corporates will shoulder the losses.“This gives the government some tolerance for market-based resolutions,” he added.Analysts are also confident that Beijing would step in to prevent widespread damage.“Chinese authorities still have very strong will and capacity to ensure the financial system remains stable despite the property market downturn, because domestic banks play quasi-policy roles and a majority of them have state ownership,” Moody’s said last month.The government has a variety of tools it can use to prevent a domino effect, including the provision of liquidity to distressed financial institutions, they added.Last month, China’s leaders pledged to address risks more systematically across the financial sector and preserve stability.",8335,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/china-shadow-banking-debt-woes-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206162135-money-counting-china-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country player significantly raise payment spotlight dozen owe refer increase partially quarter top investigation trillion manageable narrow huge woe remains amount expert hidden mysterious major vehicle tail zhongzhi liquid firm large annual gdp sheet monetary warn reduce define qualify moment trustee strong view china troubled hong restrict address shortly company banking system institution effect represent lehman struggle put traditional property particularly decade cost delayed cnn negative trust yuan spillover reach entrust surprise medium total financial economist global accounting local lent equity accord impose due august broadly insolvent common particular capital prevent past moody outlook price meltdown role small drop experience bond implosion october widespread reverberate reveal net current distressed corporate fast significant private evergrande liquidity slump million home variety west prepare ordinary form play international market limited bank trigger center reference segment soar period confident link macquarie credit year hangzhou publish p debt tolerance hedge declare loss step provision hinder downturn kong held enormous report wealthy pledge preserve leader larry wanxiang minimum despite rock dollar saving ownership criminal liability majority number average provider make estate chief developer fail purchase analysis involves sell formal largely concern crisis shoulder reinforce popular stood kaiyuan access recent industry rating corporates fear correction believe announcement regulator enterprise worsen definition shadow exposure sharp previous sunac pressure wealth directly brock tuesday financing month economy investment land hundred investor analyst add different part data group revenue pandemic loan research refers base regulation term systematically pool sizeable week default lead garden state risk place crunch downgrade worth repayment challenge high portfolio big occur mature sector conglomerate fuel generally consumer stable affect opaque pay include marked grow systemic ming director petition fund lending turmoil drag activity real tool attention impact government give couple money association ensure balance calculation individual concentrate management income chinese miss collapse asset invest especially domestic slightly authority potentially beijing provide problem show eightfold linger invests spill domino wider source mire trouble capacity billion stability product resolution silver size currently officer contagion,0.00655,0.2879424115176964,11.927434343434342,0.3181992125015382,0,2023-12-07
CNN,Elon Musk seeking to raise $1 billion for his xAI firm,2023-12-06 10:55:00,Chris Isidore,"Elon Musk is seeking to raise $1 billion for his artificial intelligence company xAI.The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said that it has already raised $135 million of that $1 billion target, and it has a “binding and enforceable agreement” for the purchase of the remaining shares available in this offering. In a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, last month Musk announced that investors in X Corp that he bought last year will own 25% of xAI.The date of the the first sale of stock in the company was November 29, which was the same day that Musk appeared at the New York Times DealBook Summit. At that appearance he apologized for antisemitic tweets on his personal X account but also told advertisers which have left X because of concerns about antisemitic content on the platform to “go f**k yourself.”Musk has been among those warning that AI could lead to “civilization destruction.” But in July he announced the creation of xAI, saying that it would “work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.”Last month in a public conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that discussed both the dangers and opportunities of AI, Musk said that the technology could lead to a world in which no one needs to work and AI companionship would be one of the highest forms of friendship.“AI will be a force for good most likely,” Musk said, before cautioning, “but the probability of it going bad is not zero percent.”Tesla has its own AI efforts as part of its goals of offering self-driving cars and robots in the future. Asked by an analyst why Musk would start a separate AI company that could be seen as competing with those efforts, Musk said it was the only way to attract some of the staff he was seeking.“There were just some of the world’s best AI engineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup, but they were not willing to join a large, sort of relatively established company like Tesla,” he said on a quarterly earnings call with Tesla investors. “So I was like, ‘Okay, well, better to start up that, that I run this, than they go work somewhere else.’ That’s kind of the genesis of xAI.”",2218,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/investing/elon-musk-seeks-1-billion-xai/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190117152549-chris-isidore-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month creation commission relatively formerly purchase kind work exchange conversation concern warn minister agreement date appearance musk form xai enforceable high tesla start company day caution civilization part medium car discuss summit binding robot attract november startup advertiser progress apologize sunak available call investor elon earnings intelligence make bought account left corp opportunity york separate time closely compete offering share danger analyst world engineer x sort establish announce effort quarterly target seek future companionship technology july rishi personal staff genesis zero large year public platform force dealbook british scientist stock f probability prime run remain goal security social tweet billion post join content raise twitter lead told antisemitic million artificial filing,0.97445,0.1352569882777276,7.848730512249443,0.4303693618209747,0,2023-12-06
CNN,US job openings hit a two-year low,2023-12-05 12:20:00,Alicia Wallace,"In October, the ‘Now Hiring’ signs weren’t as plentiful as they have been in recent years, and more workers chose to stay put.There were an estimated 8.7 million available jobs in the month, according to data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.There are an estimated 1.3 jobs available for every unemployed person, BLS data shows.That’s the lowest number job openings seen during a month since March 2021 and is further evidence of a cooling US labor market, according to the BLS’ October Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey report.October’s tally is significantly lower than the record 12.03 million positions hit in March 2022, and the figure is approaching the roughly 7 million openings seen pre-pandemic.The US labor market’s freewheeling days — massive job growth, plentiful opportunities and workers jumping ship for greener pastures — appear to be coming to an end.“Now we’re starting to head back to levels that are truly consistent with what you would call a cooling labor market,” Karin Kimbrough, chief economist with online job site LinkedIn, told CNN.After two consecutive months of JOLTS surprising to the upside, the latest job openings total came in well under expectations. Economists’ forecasts called for the October postings to hit 9.3 million, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates.The Federal Reserve has been hoping to see more slack in the labor market to help in the central bank’s fight to bring down inflation. When there’s an imbalance in the supply and demand for workers, it could cause wages to rise and, in turn, prompt companies to raise prices.In recent months, job gains have gradually eased, with the US adding only 150,000 jobs in October — the second-lowest monthly tally notched since 2021.“I think this reflects some caution on the part of employers,” Kimbrough said. “They’ve had a cautious stance in terms of hiring, but you can see it now in terms of the job openings aren’t coming in as fast as before.”Most industries saw a pullback in the number of available jobs, with some of the sharpest decreases in openings coming in the financial activities and retail industries.Other measurements of labor turnover are showing a loosening in the labor market, according to Tuesday’s JOLTS report: The number of new hires dipped to 5.89 million from 5.9 million; quits fell to 3.63 million from 3.65 million; and layoffs ticked up to 1.64 million from 1.61 million.While the monthly estimates can be quite volatile, economists have been closely watching how quits have trended, as they serve as a measurement of employees’ ease and willingness to leave their jobs.Fewer people voluntarily quitting their jobs could indicate that people are feeling less secure about the economy and signal that a further cooling of wage growth is ahead.Employees appear to be choosing to stay with the employer and job they know and starting to “shelter in place” a bit more, Kimbrough said.“[Employees are] reading the room; they recognize that they might be better off to dance with the one that brought you,” she said. “They’re definitely uncertain, and this uncertainty is actually starting to match the cautious stance that employers were already taking.”She added: “Workers are also realizing that this is a different economy.”The net job gains estimated in the monthly jobs report (due out Friday) can mask some of the gross hiring and separations that occur on a monthly basis. As such, Tuesday’s JOLTS report helps to provide a fuller picture of the hiring activity, Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese wrote Tuesday.“The hiring rate has declined from its pandemic peak in a sign that demand for new workers has softened, and the hiring boom needed to replace departing workers has slowed,” they wrote.The consensus estimate is for the US economy to have added 180,000 jobs last month, according to Refinitiv. That net gain, which is in line with the strong job growth seen pre-pandemic, is well below the breakneck pace of job gains seen during the past three years.Tuesday’s JOLTS report is the first entrant in a slew of labor market reports due out this week, including the latest data on private-sector hiring, jobless claims, job cuts and culminating with the November jobs report on Friday.",4271,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/economy/jolts-job-openings-layoffs-october/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1693347921.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,online forecast pandemic replace central march ship worker shelter basis decline data employee layoff growth release raise willingness activity sharpest picture caution fast claim fight jumping pullback culminate dance stay kimbrough decrease uncertainty karin term accord month report wage opening prompt definitely reading slow bring jolt roughly approach serve secure provide employer freewheel consensus person pace past turn demand record retail recognize number company greener peak tally boom upside day expectation hit occur linkedin economy labor consistent show fuller feel job opportunity jobless pasture trend mask indicate due leave rate financial significantly hop fell industry gross dipped start quits choose slack million late total bank sarah consecutive cool room breakneck ticked federal told year unemployed inflation massive friday available hire write reflect house back soften plentiful low position signal volatile october recent michael chose gradually loosening market voluntarily line cut bls different include place strong closely monthly surprising depart bit brought posting economist site realize ease imbalance slew fargo watch supply turnover stance figure bureau part measurement level chief uncertain entrant notch survey refinitiv separation november quit call pugliese head rise cautious evidence sign reserve add match estimate net tuesday week,0.8127500000000001,0.0702411613205338,10.199450686641692,0.4026734738691259,0,2023-12-05
CNN,CVS will change the way it prices prescription drugs,2023-12-05 12:02:00,Tami Luhby,"CVS is revamping the way it reimburses its pharmacies for prescription medications, a move that could make prescription drug pricing simpler and change how much consumers pay for their medicines.The company said in an announcement Tuesday that its new pharmacy reimbursement model will bring more transparency to its drug pricing system. It’s a similar model to the one entrepreneur Mark Cuban is pushing with his Cost Plus Drugs company.Currently, the prices customers pay for drugs and the payments pharmacies receive are largely determined by middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers to insurers. These complex reimbursement formulas aren’t directly based on what pharmacies spent to purchase specific drugs.The new approach, named CVS CostVantage, will use a simpler formula that includes the cost of the drug, a set markup and a fee to determine the drug’s price and reimbursement with pharmacy benefit managers. It is expected to launch for commercial payors in 2025. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the news.This shift in payment models could change the cost of prescription drugs for some patients, although it will not necessarily make all medicine cost less. Some drugs may cost less, while others might rise in price, CVS executives said. More prescription costs should fall than rise for consumers, employers and health insurers, they said.“We are leading with an approach that will shift how our retail pharmacy is compensated by implementing a more transparent and sustainable model that fairly aligns pharmacy reimbursement to the quality services we provide,” said Prem Shah, president of CVS Pharmacy and chief pharmacy officer at CVS Health, in a statement. “It provides our [pharmacy benefit managers] and payor clients a foundational step towards more pricing clarity for consumers.”The health care industry as a whole provides less price transparency for consumers than other businesses.“At a minimum, the goal for CVS and others should be to shine a light on the way drugs are priced, any discounts that are negotiated and overhead that comes from a variety of sources,” said Nick Fabrizio, senior lecturer in health policy at Cornell University. “Americans would be surprised at the hidden costs that are passed on to them by a variety of third parties. These extra or hidden costs make prescriptions more expensive.”Cuban’s Cost Plus Drug Company provides price transparency throughout the prescription drug supply chain, Fabrizio said, noting that it is “forcing pharmacies to change their model to remain competitive.”The announcement is the latest in series of changes that are roiling the prescription drug pricing model.The high cost of medications is one of Americans’ biggest health care headaches, and the lack of transparency surrounding how prices are set have been a focus of a multitude of players, including Congress, which is considering several bills to force more light into the process.Americans spend around $1,200 a year on average for prescription drugs — more than any other country — according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. One out of every three US adults taking prescription drugs say that they’ve been unable to take their medication as prescribed due to cost, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.CVS Caremark’s business suffered a significant blow over the summer when a major California health insurer, Blue Shield of California, announced it will no longer use the company as its pharmacy benefit manager and instead will partner with several companies, including Amazon Pharmacy and Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company.Blue Shield said earlier this year that Cuban’s pricing model will be “simple, transparent and more affordable.” The move could shake up the prescription drug pricing system beyond Blue Shield’s 4.8 million members.This story has been updated with additional context.",3941,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/investing/cvs-drug-prices/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180709143124-tami-luhby-circle-cut.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,customer policy overhead blow change update specific due suffer costvantage similar player unable caremark blue price light president goal average industry lecturer negotiate payment directly fabrizio fee revamp simple service million additional late multitude family consumer discount pass kaiser foundational announcement consider big pay mark determine series clarity manufacturer spent year shah organization set markup system step sustainable move high focus development patient shine shake cost lack roil commercial fairly note accord expect rebate force country fall report pharmacy transparent medication chain aligns manager minimum major statement announce bring source street nick bill largely significant approach variety include complex cuban executive purchase provide cornell congress transparency american reimburses employer hidden remain quality california party receive cv lead model entrepreneur supply necessarily retail prem journal push simpler medicine payor pricing surround shift instead payors launch prescription company surprised prescribed summer headache economic chief compensate base health wall implement insurer middleman benefit story business earlier longer spend reimbursement rise client senior officer shield extra formula partner amazon make tuesday university adult context,0.7808,0.0,12.285364431486876,0.4011961038961039,0,2023-12-05

Reuters,Exclusive: ECB hawk Schnabel scraps more rate hikes after 'remarkable' inflation drop,2023-12-05 09:46:00,not specified,"FRANKFURT, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank can take further interest rate hikes off the table given a ""remarkable"" fall in inflation and policymakers should not guide for rates to remain steady through mid-2024, ECB board member Isabel Schnabel told Reuters.The comments mark a dovish shift for Schnabel, seen as the most influential voice in the conservative camp of policymakers that has driven the steepest increase in interest rates in the ECB's history over the past 1-1/2 years.Euro zone inflation tumbled to 2.4% last month from above 10% a year earlier after a record string of rate hikes. That has put the ECB's 2% inflation target within sight and raised doubts about policymakers' warnings that another two years of stubborn price growth may be ahead.Schnabel, who had insisted just a month ago that rate hikes must remain an option because the ""last mile"" of the inflation fight may be the toughest, said she had shifted stance after three unexpectedly benign inflation readings in a row.""When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?"" Schnabel said in an interview, repeating a quip often attributed to John Maynard Keynes. ""The most recent inflation number has made a further rate increase rather unlikely.""Schnabel also warned against guiding markets on interest rate moves too far ahead, given rapidly changing inflation figures that are surprising policymakers on the way down, as they did on the way up.ECB President Christine Lagarde, French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras have all guided for steady rates for the next ""few"" or ""several"" quarters, even as markets see a rate cut in the early spring.""We have been surprised many times in both directions,"" Schnabel said. ""So we should be careful in making statements about something that is going to happen in six months' time.""Schnabel, a German, is the first of the ECB's policy hawks to signal a shift in view. Her comments come after Bundesbank Chief Joachim Nagel said the November data did not change his mind and a rate hike was still a possibility.Markets are pricing in more than five cuts in the ECB's 4% deposit rate, with the first seen coming as soon as March.Schnabel pushed back more modestly on these bets than some of her colleagues.""Central banks are more cautious and I would argue they have to be more cautious,"" she said. ""After more than two years of above-target inflation, we need to err on the side of caution.""Overall price growth was always expected to drop quickly through the autumn but the rapid decline in underlying inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is underpinning the guarded optimism.""This is quite remarkable,"" Schnabel said.

CNN,Nvidia is the stock of the year. Can it last?,2023-12-05 07:37:00,Nicole Goodkind,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.It would be an understatement to say that it’s been a good year for Nvidia. The California-based chipmaking giant has seen its shares soar about 220% this year, making it the top performing S&P 500 stock in 2023.But will next year bear the same fruit for the sixth most valuable company in the world?What’s happening: Just before Thanksgiving, Nvidia crushed doubts that its star was fading by reporting gangbuster third quarter earnings.Revenue was up 34% from the prior quarter and 206% from a year ago. The company also upped its guidance, meaning it expects the good times to keep on rolling. The AI firm forecast that its revenue for the final quarter of the year would come in at about $20 billion — analysts had projected about $17.8 billion.Still, there’s a feeling on Wall Street that the reign of Nvidia can’t last forever and that cracks in the company’s facade are beginning to show.Troubling signs ahead? One troubling sign for Nvidia is that the company’s own executives appear to be cashing out. Executives and top brass at the company sold or said they intend to sell a collective 370,000 shares of the stock in November, according to data from the Washington Service, a data and analytics company.All in all that’s worth about $180 million.If all the shares that were registered for sale during November are ultimately sold, the insider aggregate selling would be the largest at Nvidia in a month since December 2021. By value, if completely fulfilled, November 2023 would have the highest monthly value of stocks sold in the history of the company by insiders, according to Hannah de Wolf, business and product development lead at the Washington Service.No executive or director purchased shares of the company’s stock over that same period.New restrictions on chip exports to China have also tempered some enthusiasm for the company and could weigh down future profit.“The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business, and we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long term,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on a press call last month.There’s also a question of momentum. Can a company with a $1.2 trillion market cap continue to grow at an exponential rate?“We’ve all heard the advice to under-promise and over-deliver, but it can start to work against you if people come to routinely expect that sort of thing,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “It’s something we’ve become accustomed to with NVDA.”AI goldrush: But Nvidia has been staying relevant by cashing in on the AI craze, much like they did with crypto when that was the trend du jour.“It is quite reasonable to think of NVDA as selling picks and shovels, first to the cryptocurrency gold rush, now to the AI gold rush,” wrote Sosnick in a recent note.By Sosnick’s count, Nvidia executives mentioned AI at least 70 times on their most recent earnings call. The term was brought up 37 times even before the first question was asked, he said.Leaning into AI could extend Nvidia’s success into the new year as Wall Street continues to bet on monetizing artificial intelligence in the hopes of another 1990s-esque tech revolution.“We view AI as the most transformative technology trend since the start of the Internet in 1995 and believe many on the Street are still underestimating the $1 trillion of AI spend set to happen over the next decade in a bonanza for the chip and software sectors looking forward with Nvidia … leading the way,” wrote Dan Ives of Wedbush in a recent note.Goldman Sachs analysts recently gave Nvidia a 34% upside over the next 12 months with a price target of $625 per share (it’s currently trading at about $452). Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar believes that the company is still trading at a discount compared with its valuation and that it’s not done with its upward trajectory.Not everyone agrees. “Nvidia is a great company, but it needs to grow 30% per year for it to sustain its valuation,” Sarat Sethi, DCLA managing partner, said on CNBC last week. In order for that to happen, he said, “people are going to have to pay the same prices at the same margins and demand is going to increase and no competition is going to come in.”While Sethi thinks it’s a fine stock to own, he cautioned that investors shouldn’t devote too large a percentage of their portfolio to it. “It’s a very volatile stock,” he said.Historically, Nvidia has had hard falls after missteps — between 2021 and 2022, shares of the stock fell by 66%. “You need to be prepared,” said Sethi.Bets against the value of Israeli companies spiked in the days before the October 7th Hamas attacks, suggesting some traders may have had advance knowledge of the looming terror attack and profited off it, according to new research released Monday.The preliminary research, which hasn’t been peer reviewed, is from law professors at Columbia University and New York University and details a “significant” and “unusual” spike five days before the attacks in short selling in the most popular fund linked to Israeli companies, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Short selling is a way to bet against the value of a security.Those bets against the value of the MSCI Israel Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the days before the October 7 attack “far exceeded” the short selling activity that took place during the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2014 Israel-Gaza war and the 2008 global financial crisis, the paper finds.“Our findings suggest that traders informed about the coming attacks profited from these tragic events,” the authors wrote.The paper, titled “Trading on Terror?”, was written by former SEC commissioner Robert Jackson Jr., who is currently a professor at NYU, and Columbia law professor Joshua Mitts.The research found that on October 2, just five days before the Hamas attack, “nearly 100% of the off-exchange trading volume in the MSCI Israel ETF … consisted of short selling.”“Days before the attack, traders appeared to anticipate the events to come,” the professors wrote.Mitts, one of the paper’s authors, told CNN in a phone interview that due to the limited nature of public trading data, he believes it’s “highly likely” there is more trading that went on behind the scenes. “We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg,” Mitts said. “There is a lot more out there that we can’t pick up on but that regulators should be looking at.”Mitts added that he and Jackson, his co-author, are “very confident” that the trading activity is “exceptional” and “extraordinary” when compared with over a decade of trading and “not the product of ordinary trading.”The authors at present don’t know the location of parties making trades and whether the traders were connected to any particular financial firms, government entities or terrorist organizations. And they urge caution before drawing such conclusions.“Linking it back to Hamas is very speculative and we’re not suggesting this,” Mitts said, adding there are a wide range of possibilities including the potential that someone “overheard something” and acted on it.Read more here.A few weeks ago, Before the Bell wrote about a threat to the $5.1 billion American whiskey industry.The EU, the largest export market for American whiskey, is set to impose a 50% tariff on imports of the golden liquor on January 1.Spirit industry advocates say that would be a devastating blow to a growing part of the US economy. The move is all part of a retaliatory package of tariffs being imposed on US goods by the EU in relation to a dispute over steel and aluminum.On Tuesday, a group of bipartisan lawmakers, led by democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, sent a letter to the Biden administration, urging officials to resolve the dispute with the EU by the end of the year and avoid what insiders are saying will be “dramatic” damage to the industry.“The American spirits industry supports over 19,000 jobs in Nevada and funnels billions into our economy each year,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “I’m urging the administration to act now to eliminate these devastating tariffs on American exports and stand up for American workers.”The letter, shared exclusively with CNN, was signed by 12 US Senators also including Indiana republican Todd Young, Virginia democrats Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, Kentucky republican Rand Paul, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Tennessee republicans Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn, West Virginia democrat Joe Manchin, Kansas republican Roger Marshall, and Alaska republican Katie Britt.“Spirits have had a significant cultural impact in our country, and currently have a profound impact on the US economy. In 2022 alone, US distilled spirit exports reached $2.06 billion. But the impact of the retaliatory tariffs was devastating… Our belief is that the imposition of additional tariffs on this industry is detrimental,” the senators wrote.“There are mutual benefits in finding a path forward, and our belief is that spirits and wines are a point where there can be consensus to limit the damage for all parties.”",9264,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190624171745-20190624-before-the-bell-logo-large-169.png?q=h_83,w_390,x_0,y_0/w_1280/h_80",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,blow draw doubt forecast pandemic reign sec craze mitch unusual sachs time happen dispute trader register profound data commissioner star dcla consist january additional damage release title fund harsh activity caution broker pay rush set exponential crypto popular robert lot high month report perform ultimately catherine shovel west bill order relation virginia masto history consensus target p connect crush marsha analytics demand give particular control hannah trading nevada limit egan katie world benefit location day limited cnbc business prior point meaning underestimate preliminary cash kaine bear export director columbia nyu make fading eliminate relevant completely bell share prepared feel temper former job version law subscriber sarat sort technology link republican stand path lawmaker rate financial weigh price strategist transformative cortez minority administration hagerty service extend advance believe bonanza margin success sethi scene percentage find aggregate research trillion year organization hope audio loom dramatic entity december letter accustom write detail kress value expect spirit final crisis reasonable trouble recently listen cap kentucky colleague whiskey continue analyst place compare finding purchase terrorist brass manage range terror brought count revenue collective liquor party reporting nvidia product lead package joe colette press sixth threat ahead story cryptocurrency november insider investor reach exceed call belief short sign israeli add work portfolio sosnick tuesday wedbush week university momentum manchin giant increase steel found understatement exclusively phone group competition hamas guidance firm soar regulator view negative global overheard valuable gangbuster mention public sell ago fruit question volume hard wide stay democratic alaska china extraordinary development visibility enthusiasm project roger term accord country mcconnell intelligence spike interactive goldrush cfo rand york cultural street bet executive newsletter artificial roll advocate review professor forever impact restriction funnel tariff nvda company todd exchange tragic internet joshua blackburn chip upside author fulfil devastate future spend quarter pick large economy billion distil leader grow resolve urge chipmaking top forward import trend iceberg long suggest due begin etf thanksgiving decade attack confident paul detrimental fell facade routinely industry tennessee start avoid advice magnitude click discount crack monetize highly kansa warner possibility stock mark event software ives sector told cnn upward effect kumar jackson exceptional move intend sustain wine nature bipartisan trade official israel back matt fall support volatile october fine golden recent democrat profit market government gold great potential significant include speculative ordinary sandler interview monthly impose currently american paper tim valuation agrees biden worth earnings misstep present knowledge part steve chief anticipate wall upped tech piper devote senator msci young peer tip washington partner retaliatory marshall inform heard imposition wolf mutual indiana act,-0.69535,0.0971502590673575,9.085612472160353,0.4313183313183313,0,2023-12-05
Reuters,Central bank blunders undermine tough rate talk,2023-12-05 06:14:00,Francesco Guerrera,"LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Words are fighting it out with numbers in financial markets at present. Comments by central bankers underline their desire to keep interest rates high until price growth quiesces. Traders, however, are paying closer attention to falling inflation figures, sending bonds higher in the expectation of lower borrowing costs. Policymakers’ recent mistakes mean they will struggle to convince investors their tough talk is real.U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell says his fellow policymakers are “not thinking about rate cuts at all”. Christine Lagarde, the European Central Bank president, insists she will not ease monetary policy for at least “the next couple of quarters”, while Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has vowed to do “what it takes” to bring inflation down to Britain’s 2% target. The titans of central banking could not have been clearer: having hiked borrowing costs to multi-year highs, they intend to keep them there until consumer price growth comes back down to earth. Unfortunately, investors don’t appear to have got the message.Western bond markets have been on a tear, powered by investors’ belief that falling inflation and economic weakness will force Powell and his colleagues to backtrack further and faster than they expect. November was the best month for U.S. bonds since May 1985, according to Deutsche Bank analysts, while global bonds had their best monthly performance since December 2008. The yield on the world’s most important sovereign credits – 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds – fell from nearly 5% in October to 4.3% in November, the biggest monthly decline since July 2021 . Yields on two-year Treasuries, which are more responsive to official rates, have fallen from 5% in July to around 4.6% today .The drop in yields, which move inversely to bond prices, reflects rapidly shifting expectations. Markets now believe that there is a near-50% probability the Fed will cut rates in March and an 80% chance it will act in May, according to derivatives prices collected by LSEG. That was hard to imagine as recently as a month ago. The same thing is happening in the euro zone. In defiance of Lagarde’s statement, investors ascribe a more-than-even chance the ECB will cut rates in March and believe there is only an 8% probability official borrowing costs will still be at the current level of 4% in April.The disconnect matters beyond policymakers’ pride and traders’ bragging rights. If central bankers are true to their word, bond markets will suffer a reversal, exposing investors, banks and companies to painful losses on their debt holdings. The near-collapse of several UK pension funds in September 2022 and the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in March are two recent examples of the financial damage sharp moves in bond prices can do.But if investors continue to believe in early rate cuts, they will make life even more difficult for Powell, Lagarde and Bailey. Lower yields encourage companies and households to take on more debt. That, in turn, can drive more production and consumption.Investors have been wrong before. In May, after another U.S. regional bank failure, markets concluded that the Fed’s rate hike at the beginning of that month would be its last. The yield on two-year Treasuries dropped to 3.7%. As the month wore on, unemployment fell to a 53-year low and inflation remained high. By the end of the month, two-year Treasury yields were nearing 4.6%.Yet central banks are once again struggling to get their voices heard. That’s partly for objective reasons: inflation has been falling more rapidly than expected. In the United States, the core personal consumption expenditure index, which excludes food and energy prices and is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, rose by 3.5% year-on-year in October – the slowest pace since April 2021. Over the past six months, core PCE has grown at an annual pace of around 2.5%, not far from the Fed’s 2% target.In the euro zone, headline inflation dropped to 2.4% in November from 2.9% a month earlier, within shooting distance of the ECB’s goal. It was the third straight month that consumer prices grew by less than market expectations. UK inflation fell to 4.6% in October, from 6.7% in September, the biggest monthly fall since April 1992.Respected central bankers might be able to convince markets that these numbers don’t portend imminent rate cuts. But the current crop of rate-setters failed to anticipate the inflationary spike. Powell blew a hole in the Fed’s reputation by insisting that the inflation sparked by the pandemic was a “transitory” phenomenon until late November 2021. At the time, the core PCE index was growing at 4.7% a year, the fastest pace since the 1990s. The Fed waited four more months to sanction its first hike. By then, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had pushed prices up further.The BoE moved faster, first raising borrowing costs in December 2021, but has since been terrible at forecasting inflation. Its projections underestimated the actual numbers by an average of 6 percentage points between December 2021 and March this year, according to Breakingviews calculations based on data collected by Berenberg analysts. Bailey acknowledged the problem in July when he asked former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke to review the BoE’s forecasting methods. As for the ECB, at the end of 2021, it predicted that inflation in 2022 would be 3.2%. It came in at nearly three times that level.There are extenuating circumstances. The huge fiscal stimulus doled out by governments during the pandemic fuelled unusually high spending on goods by locked-up consumers. As that inflationary wave was waning, the Ukraine war upended supply chains and energy markets, leading to spikes in the prices of food, electricity and many services. Nevertheless, central banks’ old-school models failed to factor in these price shocks.Now markets are betting policymakers will commit a symmetrical sin by crying wolf over persistent price pressures just when inflation is fast disappearing. Central bankers could, of course, admit they cannot micromanage financial markets. But that too would damage their inflation-fighting credentials. Still, as Jacob Frenkel, a former Bank of Israel governor, told reporters recently, for policymakers “humility is the name of the game”.Follow @guerreraf72 on XCONTEXT NEWSU.S. economic activity slowed from early October through the middle of November, while businesses reported inflation largely moderated and it was easier to hire workers, the Federal Reserve said in a report on Nov. 29.",6586,https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/central-bank-blunders-undermine-tough-rate-talk-2023-12-05/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CVA6IGYOZNPONJBHHVOX2WSYIM.jpg,Business and Economy,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,today july believe treasury convince model report expectation current present chain food huge bet interest company unemployment couple imagine blew sanction goal method central analyst valley cut make energy stimulus cry expect turn decline fuel talk december earlier earth continue expenditure shift drive pace reputation bailey remain performance commit global christine chance number london portend fail tear back mistake russia price data percentage conclude ukraine factor official forecasting hard service tough united uk base point humility difficult crop financial push powell doled reporter core loss inflationary debt regional objective wolf expose quarter damage andrew index wan activity phenomenon symmetrical force wait heard euro fast credit fell hire struggle banker high september recently disconnect collect trader shoot anticipate quiesces bernanke target insists policy early matter breakingviews word deutsche investor state probability xcontext move low slow bond world spending told pressure act fiscal closer pay credential spike bragging worker statement rapidly important backtrack measure invasion admit faster game middle electricity wave figure supply ascribe britain persistent happen power frenkel titan reuters derivative fund headline reason october monthly circumstance governor desire cost silicon underline reserve straight fed disappear former slowest inversely time drop responsive household business spark late easy reflect grow lseg colleague hole sharp problem bring actual market voice boe comment banking unusually moderate bank unfortunately april president excludes borrowing policymakers consumer economic ago jacob grown personal failure prefer insist calculation largely big upended growth wrong encourage distance defiance month rise dec lagarde vowed federal micromanage production terrible accord past underestimated extenuate march berenberg jay year begin yield predict pension acknowledge attention raise inflation weakness holding wore monetary partly england annual rate level pandemic sovereign ecb government life hike pride belief fight lead fellow european transitory course israel average imminent suffer chair clearer send zone projection consumption ease fall reversal painful recent november intend review pce,-0.98035,0.182204676586699,9.695216326530607,0.3893205467372134,0,2023-12-05
CNN,Moody’s warns it may downgrade China,2023-12-05 06:12:00,Laura He,"Moody’s downgraded its outlook on China’s credit rating to negative from stable on Tuesday, citing risks related to “structurally and persistently lower medium-term economic growth” and ongoing troubles in its property sector.The lowering of its outlook does not automatically mean the ratings agency will downgrade China’s creditworthiness, but it increases the chances.Moody’s said the change reflects rising evidence that the authorities will provide financial support to cash-strapped local governments and state-owned enterprises, “posing broad downside risks to China’s fiscal, economic and institutional strength.”The deteriorating outlook comes at a time when the world’s second largest economy is grappling with numerous economic problems.China’s growth, one of the fastest sustained expansions for a major economy in history, was propelled for decades by a housing boom fueled by a rising population and urbanization.But the all-important property market, which has accounted for as much as 30% of the economy, fell into crisis more than two years ago after a government-led clampdown on developers’ borrowing. Analysts say the property downturn is likely to drag on, hobbling China’s growth prospects for years.Another major concern for the country is local government debt, which has soared largely due to a sharp drop in land sale revenues because of the property slump, as well as the lingering impact of the cost of imposing pandemic lockdowns.There are worries that the real estate crisis could trigger a wider financial meltdown. Major companies in China’s $3 trillion “shadow banking” industry — a sector that forms an important source of finance in the country — are facing mounting financial troubles, partly because of their exposure to failed property investments.What’s more, China faces long term population decline. The nation’s fertility rate is now even lower than Japan’s, a country long known for its aging society. Earlier this year, China released data that showed its population started shrinking last year for the first time in six decades.The decline in labor supply and increased healthcare and social spending could lead to a wider fiscal deficit and higher debt burden. A smaller workforce could also erode domestic savings, resulting in higher interest rates and declining investment.Moody’s expects China’s annual economic growth rate to slow to 4% in both 2024 and 2025, and average 3.8% a year from 2026 to 2030. Structural factors, including weaker demographics, could drive a decline in potential growth to around 3.5% by 2030, it added.China’s is expecting growth of “around 5%” this year.Moody’s retained its long-term A1 rating on China’s sovereign bonds.“The affirmation of the A1 rating reflects China’s financial and institutional resources to manage the transition in an orderly fashion,” the agency said. “Its economy’s vast size and robust, albeit slowing, potential growth rate, support its high shock-absorption capacity.”China’s Finance Ministry said Tuesday it was “disappointed” with Moody’s decision to downgrade the country’s credit outlook.“China’s economy is shifting to high-quality development, new drivers of China’s economic growth are taking effect, and China has the ability to continue to deepen reforms and respond to risks and challenges,” it said in a statement, adding that Moody’s concerns about the country’s growth prospects and fiscal sustainability are “unnecessary.”Markets, however, were not convinced.

Reuters,Short supply of homes to push global property prices higher at slower pace,2023-12-05 00:09:00,Hari Kishan,"BENGALURU, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Global property prices in most major markets will rise over the next two years, albeit at a slightly slower pace than predicted three months ago as strong demand and tight supply overshadow higher interest rates, a Reuters poll found.Home prices across the developed world have defied analysts' expectations, as they predicted at the start of the year prices would register double-digit falls from COVID-19-era peaks. In most markets they will end the year on a positive note.While price rises are expected to continue into next year and 2025, higher mortgage rates and the lack of supply of affordable homes will restrict prices from rising too much.The latest Reuters polls of over 100 housing market strategists taken between Nov. 15 and Dec. 4 showed property prices rising in five of the eight major property markets surveyed for next year and in all of them in 2025.""Values are underpinned at the moment by the fact there's low stock availability and that is defending prices. The fact prices haven't fallen very much and actually in many markets are beginning to rise again is down to the fact the stock is very low,"" said Liam Bailey, head of research at Knight Frank.""Very few vendors are bringing their properties forward into the market at the moment because they're either trying to protect their current debt costs by not moving properties and not porting their mortgages,"" he said.Of the major housing markets polled - U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and Dubai - prices were forecast to go up between 1.3% to 5% in 2025, while estimates for India were set to surpass 7%.That outlook was still good news for property owners who at the beginning of the year were anticipating a significant dip in value of their homes over expectations the global economy will enter a recession this year.But that would also mean affordability will remain a concern, especially for first-time buyers who for years have been waiting on the sidelines to get on the property ladder.Still, a strong 71% majority, 65 of 91 housing strategists, who answered an additional question said purchasing affordability for first-time homebuyers will improve over the coming year.While many analysts, 51 of 84, who answered a separate question said the supply of affordable homes will improve over the coming two to three years, only 10 among them expected it to improve to a point where it can sufficiently address the demand.""If you look at construction cost plus land costs, it's difficult to deliver affordable housing viably.

CNN,Gold has never been this expensive,2023-12-04 12:41:00,Anna Cooban,"Gold prices hit an all-time high Monday, buoyed by growing expectations of interest rate cuts among investors, a weaker dollar and geopolitical tensions.Prices for the yellow metal jumped as much as 3% in Monday trade to reach $2,135 per ounce, rising above the previous record of $2,072 notched in August 2020. Prices later fell on the day to trade at $2,023 by 11.57 a.m. ET.In recent weeks, investors have grown increasingly confident that the US Federal Reserve has successfully reined in inflation through aggressive interest rate hikes, and may start to cut borrowing costs as early as March next year.Higher interest rates push up the yields on assets such as US Treasuries, drawing in investors.But, when interest rates are low, falling or — as in this case — expected to fall, demand for Treasuries ebbs, and gold, which doesn’t pay out any interest, becomes relatively more attractive.The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bill has fallen from a 16-year high of 5% reached in mid-October to stand at 4.3% Monday.“The expectations of the end of the tightening cycle have been priced in, pushing longer-term yields lower,” Daria Efanova, head of research at trading platform Sucden Financial, wrote in a note Monday. “This has created a more favorable environment for gold as a non-yielding asset.”John Reade, a market strategist at the World Gold Council, an association of gold producers, told CNN that, with investors predicting several rate cuts over the next year, gold prices could “quite possibly” shoot above Monday’s record high.Those rate predictions have also weighed on the US dollar, again making gold more appealing. Higher interest rates tend to boost the value of a currency by attracting more capital from abroad into the country, and the reverse is true when rates fall.The dollar slumped 3% last month against a basket of six major currencies. Since gold is priced in US dollars, the fall in the greenback’s value has made it less expensive for investors outside the United States to buy the metal, which should have boosted demand and, in turn, lifted gold prices.Over a longer timeframe, gold has benefited from another factor: A deep sense of global unease. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said this may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.Investors typically see the metal as a safe haven since it is a tangible, scarce asset that, in theory, holds its value. Gold prices have risen 10% so far this year.“The geopolitical risk environment appears to have changed,” Reade said. “Not just (because of) Russia invading Ukraine, not just the terrible things going on in Israel and Gaza, but trade tensions between the US and China, concerns about what will happen in the South China Sea, concerns about what China will do in Taiwan.”A more fractured, febrile world has encouraged central banks in emerging markets to stock up on the precious metal, Reade noted. In addition, policymakers in those countries, spooked by the freezing of the Russian central bank’s foreign exchange reserves in the West, have piled into gold as an alternative store of value that they perceive to be safer, he added.According to the World Gold Council, central banks in emerging markets bought 473 metric tons (521 tons) of gold a year on average between 2010 and 2021. But last year, they bought 1,100 metric tons of the metal and, in the first three quarters of this year, 800. That breakneck pace of purchases “could continue for years, if not decades,” Reade said.Close to a quarter of all central banks said in a survey published in May that they planned to increase their gold reserves in the next 12 months.“Concerns about the shaky global economic backdrop and the Israel-Hamas conflict have fueled investor demand for safe-haven assets like gold,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said in a note. “Plus, expectations for Fed rate cuts next year have put downward pressure on the US dollar… adding to gold’s attractiveness.”",3995,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/investing/gold-price-rise-all-time-high/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230703114840-anna-cooban-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,treasury survey asset timeframe expectation draw august interest country cycle cnn week jpmorgan abroad central cut metric make expect turn fuel tend continue capital pace previous decade global backdrop expensive strategist scholar daria russia price appeal ukraine ebb precious factor reverse united financial push successfully pile south breakneck reach john quarter weigh major trade bill conflict boost gold fell downward febrile high lift typically shoot notch early possibly hold investor state low safe world interactive told pressure scarce pay relatively safer write invade attract platform unease buy gaza start monday spook happen put foreign aggressive basket russian cost hit efanova reserve plan fed investment exchange longer time benefit tension increase create ceo prediction perceive sucden concern ounce grow bought head market bank theory demand alternative council value metal change borrowing record policymakers economic association grown dangerous add store trading geopolitical tighten encourage weaker month attractiveness purchase confident rise jumped greenback currency dimon federal jamie research terrible china march case west victoria day stand year yield dollar predict fracture publish inflation buoyed addition slump emerge rate risk shaky freeze hike increasingly deep producer note favorable risen benchmark israel average rein tangible reade yellow stock fall recent environment,0.9701,0.0750938673341677,9.27875,0.3596130952380952,0,2023-12-04
Reuters,Private equity double-dips are a tasty faux pas,2023-12-04 12:00:00,Aimee Donnellan,"LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Double-dipping is frowned upon at social gatherings. Private equity groups are trying something similar in the capital markets: successfully listing a company, then coming back for a second bite by buying it back once its stock craters. Such manoeuvres may yield high returns, but they can also backfire.Take Synlab (SYAB.DE), listed at the height of a Covid-19 boom in testing by investment group Cinven. The business, which makes kits to test for coronavirus as well as diseases like cancer, is in a slump. Revenue fell 14% between 2021 and 2022, while its EBITDA margin collapsed by nearly 30%. Cinven is now offering to buy it back at 10 euros a share, a skinny 23% premium and 44% below its IPO price, valuing the group at 3.5 billion euros including debt.It’s easy to see how Cinven can make a good return. Synlab operates in markets like the UK and France, which have a growing stock of ageing citizens keen to use its more expensive testing kits. Even with the coronavirus boom fading, it should thrive. Assume Synlab can grow the 2.7 billion euros of revenue analysts expect it to deliver in 2023 at a conservative 5% rate and gets its margin back to a more respectable 23% over five years, taking EBITDA to 787 million euros. An exit on the same modest 8 times EBITDA multiple implied by Cinven’s offer would value the business at 6.3 billion euros. Cinven could more than double its money even without adding any debt to fund its purchase, according to a Breakingviews calculation that assumes 30% of Synlab’s EBITDA is used to pay down its existing borrowing each year.Cinven isn’t the only discount shopper. In August, Sweden’s EQT (EQTAB.ST) offered to buy back software group Suse for a little more than half of the valuation of the 24% stake it listed in 2021. Similar targets are plentiful. European companies listed by private equity groups since 2020 are trading, on average, at a 22% discount to their IPO price, according to data from Dealogic and Breakingviews calculations. Dr Martens (DOCS.L), listed at 370 pence in 2021 by Permira, is now worth 74% less.Bargain hunters also need willing sellers. Most investors in Synlab tendered their shares. Taking the long view, Elliott has snapped up a 7% stake. Buyout groups can hardly be blamed for making the most of other shareholders’ short attention spans. The message from such deals, however, is that it’s better to buy a private equity-owned company after it has listed.Follow @aimeedonnellan on XCONTEXT NEWSPrivate equity firm Cinven on Sept. 29 offered 10 euros a share to take Covid test maker Synlab private.",2628,https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/private-equity-double-dips-are-tasty-faux-pas-2023-12-04/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/YK64A2FIK5PMFJFC5ONGNO3WG4.jpg,Business and Economy,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,exit assumes exist fading collapse span listing dr social average analyst dealogic covid equity yield business modest target easy group aimeedonnellan maker offering august suse return stock assume citizen tender view uk investment money share similar fund grow back buyout shareholder make purchase elliott manoeuvre boom frown pay attention message margin ipo ebitda double worth year bite calculation offer euro value expect conservative half cinven private blame high deliver keen multiple coronavirus plentiful add slump respectable valuation investor premium data shopper kit deal crater company discount trading fell european breakingviews xcontext synlab cancer thrive buying price long stake rate reuters short billion million permira sweden expensive list imply penny firm dec france disease debt borrowing newsprivate successfully market time age seller skinny test hunter include snap software revenue operates eqt buy accord marten london capital gathering height,0.73275,0.3424657534246574,7.871290944123313,0.3834178743961352,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Shein and Reddit IPOs don’t herald a Wall Street boom. Here’s why,2023-12-04 11:40:00,Nicole Goodkind,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.It’s been an exciting few weeks for the IPO market.Chinese fast-fashion brand Shein filed for a US IPO last week, according to reports from Reuters. Reddit, Skims and Microsoft-backed Rubrik are also reportedly planning to make their public debuts in the coming months.That’s a big deal for an ailing IPO industry. While 2021 was a record-breaking year for companies looking to make their public debuts on the US stock market, dealmaking on Wall Street has largely dried up since then.And while a revival would be good news for bankers’ bonuses, the benefits extend beyond the wallets of the Wall Street elite.IPOs help facilitate the flow of capital to innovative and growing companies — they support job creation, economic expansion and technological advancement. Going public also requires companies to become more transparent with their finances, shedding light on often opaque business models and keeping firms honest.But an IPO renaissance on Wall Street is not quite here yet, says Angela Lee, a professor of venture capital at Columbia Business School and founder of the startup investment network 37 Angels.Before the Bell spoke to her about the prospects for the IPO market and what it’ll take to bring an end to the deal drought.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.A lot of companies are waiting for better economic and market conditions to make their public debut, and there’s an idea that one large and successful IPO could clear things out and get that pipeline going again. Could Shein be it?People try to draw an analogy between the IPO market and a blocked pipe. That’s not how it works. You have to take each IPO separately. I think what has happened is that it seems like interest rates have stayed put. It seems like the Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rates aren’t going to go up dramatically in the short term. That is one reason why the IPO market feels less stymied than it did 12 months ago. But if the current IPO market kicks off, it’s because of other macroeconomic factors. It’s not because one big IPO unblocked something, that’s very silly.We’ve got a lot of high profile names out there indicating that they’ll make their debuts. Does that mean the economy overall is more accommodating to IPOs?If you look at Skims, Shein and Reddit, I would separate them. Shein is the typical growth at all costs company. They’re going to very rapidly acquire customers and care much less about long term financial sustainability and climate and the environment. That’s one category of companies. What we have seen recently is that the market is favoring and paying attention to things like profitability and good unit economics and margins.If you look at what Reddit did, in April they announced that they would change the way that APIs interact for Reddit. [APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are access points for interacting with a platforms’ data. Reddit now charges skyhigh fees for third party apps that want to access its data.]The reason they did that is because they’re trying to make it more profitable, they’re saying ‘it’s not just that we have a huge user base, but we know how to profitably monetize that user base.’ My strong suspicion is that they were doing that to prepare themselves to look more favorable to a public market.People seem to think that the IPO is the destination and it’s not. The IPO is one milestone, but then you have to run on the public markets, and the public markets are not very forgiving of companies that grow at all costs without thinking about financial sustainability. So if a company like Shein goes public, depending on how they do once they’re on the market, it might not make people feel better.Obviously 2022 was a terrible year for both the IPO and M&A markets. This year has been a bit better, but not much. Do you think next year will be a turning point?It depends on which side you’re sitting on. It’s a great time to be an acquirer of companies. There are a lot of companies that have good business models, good customer growth and good economics, but because it is a buyers’ market they’re being traded at much lower multiples than they were two years ago. So if you’re a buyer, and you’re looking to acquire a company, it’s actually a fantastic time to buy. But I’m sure that the people who are selling don’t feel that way.People keep saying that everything is so down compared to 2020 and 2021. To me, the story isn’t that things are down, it’s that we all collectively went crazy in 2020 and 2021, and that we’ve returned to the state of normalcy. There have been about 150 IPOs so far this year and historically, about 200 companies go public each year. So it’s down a little bit, but the reason why it seems catastrophic is because there were 480 IPOs in 2020 and 1,035 in 2021. Those were crazy years, you can’t look at those years for comparison. Yes, 2023 is down but not catastrophically.What about next year? Will things continue to normalize in 2024?I think we are going to be closer to a couple hundred IPOs in 2024. But again I think you have to differentiate between the number and then the valuation multiple. I think we’ll have a more normal year in terms of the number of IPOs, but I do not think they are going to be at the valuation multiples of 2019 through 2021, recognizing that nobody can predict the future.Alaska Air (ALK) on Sunday announced it will buy rival Hawaiian Airlines (HA) for $1.9 billion.The acquisition was the culmination of “several months” of negotiations, according to Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci. It will include $900 million in Hawaiian Airlines debt, reports my colleague Eva Rothenberg.“This is a fantastic deal that brings two airlines that have amazing loyalties in our regions together,” said Minicucci in a news conference, adding that the merger will give customers in both states expanded domestic and international choices.The deal, which is forecast to take between nine and 18 months, will see both companies keep their brands, a decision Minicucci and Hawaiian Airlines CEO and President Peter Ingram say was made out of respect for the nearly 100-year legacy of the two airlines and the communities they serve.Both states are “uniquely reliant upon air travel,” Alaska Airlines said in a news release Sunday. The airline currently serves 19 cities, many of which are not connected by roads.Minicucci, who will become the CEO of both airlines, heralded the move as “pro-consumer” and would allow for the nation’s fifth-largest airline to compete more robustly with United, Delta, Southwest and American Airlines, which currently own 80% of the domestic market share.The deal could face scrutiny from antitrust authorities. It comes less than a month after JetBlue Airways CEO Robin Hayes testified in federal court following an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department and the attorneys general from six states and the District of Columbia over the company’s proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit Airlines.When asked about the timing of the acquisition, Minicucci told reporters, “We’ll let the lawyers deal with that issue.”The world’s first cargo ship that produces nearly zero planet-heating pollution is on track to set sail in 2026, reports my colleague Anna Cooban.Fertilizer producer Yara International and its partners plan to power the Yara Eyde — which is yet to be built — mostly with clean ammonia, meaning it should emit 95% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than the average fossil fuel-powered vessel, the Norwegian company told CNN.Svein Tore Holsether, the firm’s president and chief executive, hopes the vessel will show “what is possible” for the shipping industry on its road to decarbonization.“Now is the time to move away from long-term talk and promises on what we’re going to do in 2040 and 2050, and really use the technologies available today… and show that it works,” he told CNN.According to the International Maritime Organization, shipping accounts for close to 3% of global annual emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.",8253,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190624171745-20190624-before-the-bell-logo-large-169.png?q=h_83,w_390,x_0,y_0/w_1280/h_80",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,advancement sunday normalize model report flow current skyhigh draw huge planning interest dry cnn company firm couple week alaska large buyer organization deal ail yara gas make depend profitability turn fantastic loyalty talk rival continue capital holsether innovative founder jetblue herald differentiate ingram region sign american global account cargo number tore meaning technology typical lee data respect negotiation multiple factor domestic scrutiny comparison profitably forgive user separately wall length venture united accommodate spirit base hope point general million brings columbia run support financial pipeline unblocked reportedly apps reporter set conference expansion technological normal airline debt prospect monetize sail long executive return collectively robustly emission click acquisition legacy trade require shein party economy wait school eyde authority uniquely track banker high carbon recently release work reliant depends stymie shipping network angela lawyer vessel environment facilitate partner hundred currently state low move interact justice world follow told testify closer news shed pay show pollution lawsuit billion rapidly debut platform prepare forecast road travel buy dioxide community southwest ship happen put power greenhouse analogy reuters startup reason fee amaze cost transparent sell reserve spoke clear produce plan bit ammonia maritime acquirer version announce story condition climate investment favor airway creation sustainability hawaiian give time benefit historically alk public edit ceo business minicucci crazy bell light international interview access connect side grow district colleague street bring nation market compare valuation destination strong department kick merger extend antitrust charge dealmaking serf reddit april president change economic bonus ago profitable renaissance clean decision milestone catastrophic add hayes category largely big growth month built excite emit robin apis subscriber ipo suspicion file possible acquire federal zero macroeconomic city listen terrible accord newsletter chief successful available profile separate dramatically away fossil finance year audio revival court predict compete economics customer attention culmination air eva close pipe normalcy promise interface stayed annual rate industry attorney anna include short feel brand program indicate idea opaque producer timing job favorable block great propose average delta term norwegian rubrik lot application unit stock wallet expand recognize skim professor,0.99785,0.1454016721192293,8.48079404466501,0.3900731187536743,1,2023-12-04
CNN,Bitcoin hits highest level in 18 months as investors gear up for ETF approval,2023-12-04 11:40:00,Allison Morrow,"The price of bitcoin soared above $40,000 on Monday, hitting its highest level in 18 months as investors look ahead to a lower interest rate environment and key regulatory approvals that could make the crypto asset more mainstream.Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, was up more than 5% over the past 24 hours, trading at $41,600, according to CoinMarketCap.On Friday, Investors began piling on after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank’s policy was “well into restrictive territory,” words that some interpreted to mean that interest rate hikes were over, even though Powell underscored the Fed was prepared to raise rates again if needed.“Bitcoin breaking $40,000 isn’t as juicy as the first time it happened in January 2021,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of the crypto lender Nexo. “Yet consider where we were a year ago, at $15,500, and this is a significant upturn in fortunes for an asset that looked dead and buried.”The rally also reflects investors’ eagerness to move on from crypto’s most recent scandals. Last month, Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, pleaded guilty to federal money-laundering charges and resigned from his role as CEO. That came just weeks after a jury convicted FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried of orchestrating a multibillion-dollar fraud.Bitcoin is now up 150% for the year, though it remains far from its historical high of $69,000 in November of 2021.Part of the enthusiasm hinges on expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund, or spot ETF. The SEC faces a January 10 deadline to approve applications for such funds.A spot bitcoin ETF would allow traditional investors to have exposure to the digital asset without actually owning it. The market has long desired a way to ride the digital asset’s wild rallies, but its volatility has also made owning bitcoin unappealing outside of the digital asset community.",2013,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/investing/bitcoin-price-rally-spot-etf/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/201012141540-allison-morrow-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,fund etf bitcoin historical asset expectation desire hit reserve interest exposure fed popular week large sam convict central soar exchange time restrictive make ceo consider reflect founder ride market nexo ahead bank break role charge jerome cryptocurrency ftx price hour underscored friday ago security sec digital remains wild billionaire zhao spot juicy guilty unappealing trading upturn month resign powell pile antoni volatility long jury federal interpret january accord binance past hinge fortune changpeng significant regulatory lender rally approve year begin high eagerness orchestrate raise territory policy rate level word key trenchev enthusiasm investor hike low move commission world crypto scandal deadline plead prepared traditional chair application approval dead community recent monday november happen environment,0.85295,0.2980625931445603,10.953133514986373,0.43175,0,2023-12-04
Reuters,CLS to decide whether to delay FX settlement cutoff in Q1,2023-12-04 11:10:00,Laura Matthews,"NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - CLS, the largest multi-currency settlement system for FX trades globally, will decide in the first quarter of 2024 if it can delay settlement instructions for currency trades, potentially giving some reprieve to foreign asset managers at risk of failed transactions because of a U.S. stock market rule change.Currency trades funding securities transactions currently settle in two days. Investors must change their methods so those transactions are not left out of CLS, missing out on cost efficiency and risk mitigation, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule change kicks in next May.CLS is entering the second phase of a study that began this summer to determine if its CLS Settlement service can accommodate later submissions for next-day FX settlement without destabilizing the markets, Lisa Danino-Lewis, chief growth officer at CLS told Reuters.Should it conclude the change is possible, a solution could be implemented likely after the May 28, 2024 deadline for settling U.S. equity transactions one day after the trade (T+1).""We need to make sure all members can implement any changes that we agree on,"" said Danino-Lewis. CLS's multilateral netting process requires all participants submit FX payment instructions by a pre-determined time. Multi-lateral netting enables them to only transfer the net amount of their combined payment obligations in each currency, which reduces the total funding required to settle each transaction.""We're as strong as our weakest link. If one of our banks fails to pay in, it impacts everyone.""CLS has received responses from the majority of its 74 member banks asked about the impact of changing the current midnight CET deadline by either 30, 60, or 90 minutes.CLS is looking to see how that would affect, among other things, bank liquidity, funding, and timing when dealing with foreign asset managers.",1891,https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/cls-decide-whether-delay-fx-settlement-cutoff-q1-2023-12-04/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VTXYMI7FPVMIJFJQXVW2GIV7MI.jpg,Business and Economy,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,conclude currency exchange net multilateral large reduces trade enter majority transaction cost destabilize method equity decide implement change accommodate stock cl foreign reprieve settle submission determine security affect transfer chief commission impact lisa current make response strong fails growth receive globally pay timing miss efficiency solution obligation rule service member manager delay study amount enables mitigation officer total investor midnight left asset bank liquidity deal give require funding phase currently potentially link submit quarter risk settlement reuters york system day possible begin fx dec agree kick market deadline time process combine summer weak told payment participant instruction cet fail,0.56975,0.0,11.59426865671642,0.3931292087542088,0,2023-12-04
Reuters,Morning Bid: Buoyant markets hold near year's highs,2023-12-04 11:07:00,not specified,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike DolanAfter closing at their highest level of the year on Friday, U.S. stocks mostly hogged those gains into the new week - with 'peak rates' optimism, Friday's U.S. jobs report and falling oil prices jockeying with edgy geopolitics for attention.The S&P500 (.SPX) recorded its highest close since March 2022 on Friday - the month the Federal Reserve started its brutal five-percentage-point-plus interest rate squeeze. It's now just shy of a 20% gain for the year to date.The milestone was hit as Fed boss Jerome Powell, for many investors at least, gave his clearest signal yet that the rate campaign is over and the central bank was now weighing the effects and when it may be able to ease back.""We are getting what we wanted to get,"" Powell said during an event at Spelman College in Atlanta, noting the ""full effects"" of the Fed's rate hikes have not yet been felt.Powell added that ""the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced"" and the data would guide them from here.Fed futures markets think a first cut may come as soon as March - with a quarter-point easing by then already two-thirds priced.

USA TODAY,The holidays are here. So is record credit card debt. How 6 Americans are coping.,2023-12-04 10:06:02,"Daniel de Visé, Medora Lee, Betty Lin-Fisher, Bailey Schulz","The holidays are a perilous time for the nation’s credit card holders. This year, the stakes feel higher than ever. America faces a crushing credit card burden. The nation’s collective card balance stands at a record $1.08 trillion, as of the end of September. The average interest rate has hit 21%, the highest figure recorded by the Federal Reserve in nearly three decades of tracking. And now, the holidays are here. Thanksgiving ushers in the season of giving – and spending. The average holiday shopper expects to spend $1,652 this year, Deloitte reports, a bigger splurge than in any of the last three years. Much of the tab will go on cards. In an October survey of 1,036 consumers by CardRates.com, 38% of respondents said they plan to carry holiday credit card debt into the new year. Other Americans are determined to cut back. Angela Davis, 31, of Detroit is working with credit counselors to pay off $19,000 in card debt. This holiday season, she plans to keep her remaining cards under wraps. She hopes her loved ones will understand. “I don’t know what their plans are,” she joked, “but I’ve already made it clear that I’m not spending no money.” Her prudence comes even as more Americans fall behind on credit card payments, with the delinquency rate at nearly 3%, its highest point in more than a decade. Credit counseling services are seeing a steady uptick in new clients, especially Gen Zers and millennials. At the credit counseling nonprofit Money Management International, the average new client comes in with nearly $30,000 in unsecured debt, the category that includes credit cards, up from about $20,000 at the start of 2022. Credit counselors usually get less busy around the holidays, as consumers stop trying to manage their debt and double down on spending. This year is different. “We’ve actually seen a continued acceleration of people reaching out,” said Thomas Nitzsche, senior director of media and brand at the counseling service. Here are the stories of six Americans who are battling credit card debt: The holidays are a stressful time of the year for Alyssa Barnhart. The 30-year-old said she started to get into credit card debt around 2011 after a short stint with Mary Kay had her purchasing over $1,000 in products she struggled to sell. Initially, she used the card mostly for groceries or emergencies, with a few “dumb decisions,” Barnhart said. But she was able to make her minimum payments, and her credit card company slowly began to push up her limit from $3,000 to $9,000. Things began to spiral last summer, when Barnhart’s landlord in Bozeman, Montana, kicked her and her boyfriend out of their home to sell the property. “We lived in a camper for four months, and that was really hard. I started to use my credit card because life was hard and you panic,” she said. “So, I unfortunately maxed it out.” Suddenly, her monthly $500 credit card payments were no longer feasible, especially after inflation pushed up prices for essentials like gas and groceries and the pause on student loan payments ended. The winter months have been especially tough, she said. It’s the slower season for Barnhart’s landscaping work, which meant she had to take two or three extra jobs and work seven days a week during the cold months in recent years. Now that she's been promoted and has a 12-month salary, Barnhart said she’s in a better position this year. No need for a holiday hangover: How to avoid Christmas credit card debt. Still, she said she tends to start Christmas shopping in the summer to avoid splurging too much money at once in December. Barnhart said she and her boyfriend have had to penny-pinch to pay off their debts, and simple things like going out to dinner or a movie are no longer affordable. And her concerns go beyond day-to-day needs. “I may not ever be able to own a home,” she said. “I can't really save the money for a down payment or anything like that because all of my money is going to these credit cards and bills and rent.” Bailey Schulz Evan Charon, 24, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, says Christmas presents are out of the budget this year. Charon has nearly $22,500 in debt spaced across six credit cards. He blames some “pretty bad” spending habits after he got his first one at 18, which he used for various food and travel expenses. Then things began to snowball as the cost of living rose and he was charged roughly $3,000 in medical procedures to address an eye condition. Now, he’s working to pay it off. In addition to his full-time job as an accountant, Charon works up to eight hours a week with autistic children for $15 an hour. He’s cut back on spending by giving up on extracurricular activities and subscription services like Netflix, and he shops for food at discount grocery stores. The one thing he’s not cutting out is his trip to visit family on the East Coast for the holidays. As for gifts, though, he said this will be the third year in a row he’s unable to afford presents. “I think it's something that can bring a lot of shame if you're not careful,” he said. In total, he puts more than $600 toward his credit cards each month. Another $600 goes toward paying off student loans, and he’s on a payment plan with a hospital for about $100 each month. Charon said he’s fortunate to have a family that would step in to help if needed, but he doesn’t want to take advantage of them. So he continues to pay off his debt each month and prays that no unexpected expenses arise. “You lose some sleep at night, spending a few extra hours trying to make the numbers work,” he said. “It’s stressful. Tiring,” he added. “There's a certain part of me that knows that this won't be forever, but at the same time it feels like it's going to be such a long time.” Bailey Schulz Angela Davis, a Detroit resident who is working off her credit card debt, is planning an austere Christmas. Davis, 31, enrolled at the University of Michigan in the fall of 2018, pursuing a master’s degree in public health at the Ann Arbor campus. She financed her education with student loans and her job, working 12-hour shifts as a sanitation supervisor at a produce plant near her Detroit home. She thought she could both work and study full time. “I would literally drive to work, go home, lie down for an hour, take a shower, then go to Ann Arbor,” she said. The routine lasted about two months. Exhausted, Davis quit her job. Because student loans could not support her expenses, she began taking on credit card debt: A hundred dollars here, a hundred there, mostly groceries and gas and the occasional meal out with her fiancé. Despite working hard at making payments, her card balances crept up. During the holidays, she fell further behind. By 2020, the year she earned her master’s, Davis had debt scattered across several cards with interest rates ranging as high as 24%. Because she followed the budget-balancing gurus Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman, she knew she was in trouble, and had some strategies for digging out: She contacted the card companies to negotiate lower interest rates. She closed some of the accounts. She kept two or three open, including her Old Navy card and a traditional credit card “for if I’m renting a car, or something like that.” In early 2022, on the advice of a friend, she took her remaining debt – $19,000, on five closed accounts – to Money Management International, the nonprofit credit counselor. Today, Davis has $8,000 in debt on three cards. She paid off two using a popular debt-reduction strategy called the “snowball”: You make aggressive payments on the debt with the smallest balance, aiming to retire it quickly, scoring both a financial and psychological win. While never a big spender, Davis said she has found ways to cut back. She dines at home more often, but when she and her fiancé eat out, “We’re just not going to the $200 restaurants, getting our steaks and shrimp cocktails,” she said. Tricks, like only drinking water, save her from a $40 bar tab. She also saves more money by working from home as a registered dietitian nutritionist. To keep Christmas costs manageable, she plans to avoid buying gifts. “I’ll probably get cards,” she said. “I think my loved ones are pretty understanding. Look: I’m trying to get everybody on the bandwagon of paying off debts.” Daniel de Visé Living within her means is how single mom Kim Mahoney, 40, has spent her life in Chicago. Yet, she has about $6,000 in credit card debt. “It wasn't from extravagant vacations or living outside my means,” said Mahoney, a dietitian. “Sometimes emergencies happen, and you aren't left with a choice.” Still, she's not letting that ruin her holiday. With careful budgeting, she'll have money to spend. “I ... tend not to make extravagant purchases around the holiday season. I’m always looking for deals on presents or experiences for my child, and I budget toward the end of the year for these things.” Unexpected expenses in 2022 and 2023 ate up all of Mahoney's savings and more, putting her deep in the red. It could have easily turned into a spiraling debt situation, except that she quickly developed a plan. “Thankfully, I have very good credit and was able to get a credit card that had a 0% interest rate for 12 months, which allows me to pay it off over time without incurring interest charges,” she said. With that 0% interest card, she’s been spared the pain of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes over the past year and a half. Since March 2022, the central bank has raised its short-term benchmark fed funds rate by 5 percentage points to fight elevated inflation. Those hikes have driven up some credit card interest rates to around 30%. “This has taken a lot of stress off of having to adhere to a stricter budget to avoid incurring interest charges,” Mahoney said. By avoiding interest payments, she has money to spend this holiday and can continue funneling money to her retirement and her 7-year-old son's Bright Start 529 education and savings account each month. And she remains determined not to squander the grace period she has with her 0% rate card. “I have budgeted a set amount every month to contribute to pay this off over the 12 months,” she said. She is on track to accomplish that. Once Mahoney pays off her card, she said she’s going to turn her focus to rebuilding savings. And maybe, she will finally get a financial adviser. “That’s next on my to-do list,” she said. Medora Lee Cynthia Davis has a strategy for managing holiday wish lists: She pays cash or takes advantage of payment plan options when shopping for her high school son, who often wants expensive computer equipment. It helps her spread the cost out without going further into debt, said Davis, 52, of Perris, California. Davis has worked as a social worker for 26 years. Delivering for DoorDash and operating a side bakery also have helped her generate enough income to pay the bills, especially during the holidays. The biggest debt she carries is her student loan, estimated at $300,000, from college and graduate school. She recently had to start her $450 monthly loan payments. Davis is still hoping for a program that forgives the loans, especially since she is a social worker, and has applied for forgiveness. She also had to spend a lot on lawyers during a custody issue. Her credit card debt is smaller ‒ about $1,000 on two cards. But Davis still carries a balance and pays high interest rates because she has to prioritize bill-paying in her budget. She tries to pay more than the minimum each month on the cards, which have interest rates of 27% and 29%, but “you know, it’s just never enough,” she said. Davis said she often got into credit card debt because she didn’t have the best money skills growing up. “You’re like ‘Oh, I got a credit card and I could use it’ without thinking ‘I’ve got to pay it back,’” Davis said. “I’ve just now gotten to the point where I’m better at my credit.” The single mom recently moved into a house that her parents bought, but she helps with the bills. She also has a new car and insurance payments since her son recently began driving and outgrew their smaller vehicle. Her son’s Christmas requests have gotten more expensive as he has gotten older ‒ plus his birthday falls in early December. He enjoys building computers, and one year, the price tag was $1,200. After adding in a new desk, the total cost came to about $2,000. Now she either waits to buy the present until she has the cash, or she uses payment plans to break the cost into four installments. “Then I only have to put a little chunk of money down on it and it’s almost like layaway,” she said. This year, Davis’s parents will give her son some money to spend on computers for Christmas. Now that he's older, her son also understands that “Mommy is Santa Claus,” she said. “If we can’t get it now, we work on it and we get it later,” she said. She's holding off on working for DoorDash because she doesn't feel as comfortable in the new neighborhood she moved to. Her bakery business, however, remains a valuable side hustle, even though the ingredients add up and cut into her profits. “It helped me put a down payment on a car,” she said. Betty Lin-Fisher This Christmas, Walker and Kayla Dunn will toast the end of a four-year nightmare of credit card debt. The story began in 2018 when the Dunns made a time-honored real estate play. They bought a fixer-upper in Midland, Texas, for $280,000. Then, they set about remodeling it into their dream home. They planned to cover the renovation costs with $30,000 in personal loans. When the work was done, they would refinance the mortgage at a larger sum and use some of the proceeds to repay the smaller loans, along with any other debt they had taken on. “We started with a blank canvas,” said Walker Dunn, 42. They lived in the home as they overhauled its interior, preparing dinner in the dining room while they rebuilt the kitchen, and washing dishes in the half-bath. When their personal loans ran out, they leaned on credit cards with high limits. “Me and my wife, we both make really good money,” Dunn said. “On paper, we looked very stable.” And then, the dream darkened. On Thanksgiving week in 2019, Kayla lost her job. With one big salary gone, they leaned harder on their credit cards, finally maxing them out. They struggled to keep up with the mortgage and the personal loans. “It kind of hit us all at once,” Walker said. “Going over the budget with my wife, I was like, ‘There’s no way we’re ever going to catch up.’” They contemplated bankruptcy. Instead, in late 2019, they sought credit counseling from Money Management International. They entered the program with $55,000 in debt across 14 accounts, with interest rates ranging as high as 28%. Credit counselors helped them get on top of their debt, negotiating the interest rates down to an average of 3%. Even then, the monthly payments added up to about $2,300, akin to a second mortgage. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, the Dunns requested mortgage forbearance, a temporary pause on payments for homeowners in duress. Under the terms of the forbearance, however, they could no longer refinance their mortgage to pay down their credit cards. They put the house up for sale. It sold for $365,000 in the autumn of 2020, delivering a modest profit to the struggling family. Kayla got a new job as a financial analyst in San Antonio. Now, the Dunns were a two-income couple once more. (Walker works in business relations for a maintenance company.) They moved to San Antonio with their children, a girl and boy, now aged 10 and 8, “and basically started all over,” Walker said. The Dunns cut back on family vacations and put off home improvement projects to keep up with the aggressive monthly payments. Today, they are working through the last of their debt, spending a scant $300 a month. They expect to be debt-free by year’s end. They have learned some lessons. Walker winces at the money he charged on top-flight appliances for the abandoned dream home: Never again. “If you want to do home improvements, pay in cash,” he said. “That’s my mantra from now on.” In the past few years, the Dunns have felt strapped at Christmas. This year will be different. The couple may even splurge on a few big-ticket items for the kids. Even so, Dunn said, the family plans to shop smart: ""watching items that are on sale, looking for deals before we buy.""

CNN,Here’s why some bond traders care so much about the US government’s budget deficit,2023-12-03 07:30:00,Bryan Mena,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.It’s no secret that the US government has amassed trillions in debt over the past few decades. The national debt currently stands at more than $33 trillion, according to the Treasury Department, and there aren’t any signs that debt could meaningfully shrink anytime soon.And as the mountain of debt keeps piling up, and the government’s budget deficit remains massive, ﻿some bond traders are now joining politicians in decrying the government’s ever-growing financial obligation.They’re known as “bond vigilantes,” fixed-income traders who threaten or actually sell bonds in protest of an issuing entity’s policies or financial situation, and in this case, it seems to be the US deficit.They believe that the US government is supplying too much public debt, through the issuance of bonds, than investors are willingly able to absorb in an environment of elevated inflation and high interest rates. In protest, bond vigilantes dump bonds, which causes yields to rise. Bond vigilantes can also protest the actions of a central bank, like they did in the 1980s.Those bond traders are seemingly up in arms over the government’s gaping budget deficit — something that occurs when the government’s spending outstrips revenues — which currently stands at roughly $67 billion so far for the current fiscal year.For the full 2023 budget year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the deficit stood at a staggering $1.5 trillion.The national debt and the deficit aren’t the same thing, but they go hand-in-hand. The debt includes both the government’s borrowing because of the deficit and the interest paid to investors who bought those securities.“As the federal government experiences reoccurring deficits, which are common, the national debt grows,” according to the Treasury Department.Treasury issues debt during periodic auctions to fund its spending.They say that the government’s fiscal situation is unsustainable, given that the US debt-to-GDP ratio is near record levels and is only expected to increase.In fact, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell himself said Friday during a moderated discussion in Atlanta that previous Fed chairs have generally agreed that the federal budget “is on an unsustainable path.”Before the Bell sat down with Joe Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, on the perspective of bond vigilantes on the heels of a banner month for bonds in November.(This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.)Before the Bell: Why did bond vigilantes come back into the fray?Joe Quinlan: When you have such a robust economy, it’s very unusual for bond traders to see the government run these huge budget deficits when you’re growing at the rate that we’ve been growing. Budget deficits are typically pandemic related or recession related, so that makes the credit market be on edge, and the deficit is larger because of less revenue, too. I can tell you from talking to clients, that’s top of mind. How do we manage the budget deficit? Does that require more tax? Can you inflate it away? Can you grow out of it? So that’s very top of mind amongst creditors. It’s not just the spending, it’s also the lack of revenue.Why do those traders care so much about the deficit exactly?There are a lot of moving parts and potential implications of the deficit. It could mean we go into fiscal consolidation after the first half of this decade, which is when government policy is focused on reducing the deficit. There’s a lot of interest on the deficit because of what it means for credit, for growth, for funding, who’s paying for what, and how do we lower it, so the interest from traders is really across the board. This is all important because of the structurally higher cost of capital, structurally higher defense spending, just given the world that we’re in, and interest payments have also structurally moved higher in terms of what we have to pay to service that debt. There are some cyclical and structural issues here at play.Given the current fiscal situation and the fact that the bond market just enjoyed a remarkable month, what’s next for bonds?Our interest rate team is looking at the 10-year (US Treasury) yield to be closer to 4% than 5% next year. You’d have to forecast a recession or deep downturn in the economy to get below 4% and stay there, like 3.5%, because you’d be looking at a much weaker economy, which we don’t see. That’s kind of where we’ve historically been in certain periods like the ’80s and ‘90s, but a lot of things still have to go right in that sense. It’s also important to remember that foreigners own 20% of US Treasuries, so we need that foreign participation. Fortunately, the US economy is the strongest in the world.Investors have mostly concluded that the Federal Reserve is done hiking interest rates and are already looking toward rate cuts next year, possibly as early as in the first half of 2024.Fed Chair Jerome Powell says: Not so fast.“Having come so far so quickly, the [Fed] is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced,” Powell said Friday in opening remarks before a moderated discussion at Spelman College in Atlanta.“It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease,” he said.Powell’s comments come less than two weeks ahead of the central bank’s upcoming policy meeting, on December 12-13.

CNN,Clean energy stocks have fallen out of favor. They face more challenges ahead,2023-12-03 03:00:00,Krystal Hur,"Clean energy stocks are out of vogue, as higher interest rates and lagging efforts to combat climate change dog the sector. Those obstacles might not go away anytime soon.The iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund, which tracks the performance of sectors from renewable electricity to semiconductors to solar energy, has slumped 27% this year, underperforming the MSCI All-Country World index’s 15% gain. The fund is on pace for its third straight annual loss.Plug Power shares have slipped 63% this year, Enphase Energy shares have plunged 60%, SolarEdge Technologies shares have declined 71% and NextEra Energy shares have slid 29%.The Biden administration’s sweeping Inflation Reduction Act promised $750 billion in funding for health and climate projects. Since its passage last year, more than 270 new clean energy projects have been announced, with $132 billion in private investments, according to a Bank of America report released in August.Yet clean energy stocks haven’t recovered, despite hopes that an influx of US government spending on climate solutions would help revive the sector.The culprit behind clean energy stocks’ poor returns? Interest rates are perched at a 22-year high after the Federal Reserve began its aggressive rate hiking campaign last March, driving up borrowing costs for growing companies trying to load up on capital. Supply chain snarls have further complicated matters.Money managers say that while some clients are interested in owning shares of sustainability-driven companies, those challenges make it difficult to simultaneously maximize portfolio returns.Expectations that rates will remain elevated at least through the beginning of 2024 could keep the lid on those firms’ earnings. Clean energy names tend to trade on their future earnings potential, since they’re part of a fledgling sector. But there are concerns that these stocks are pricey relative to their current balance sheets, despite their steep decline this year.“There are some really rosy assumptions being baked into the share prices” of clean energy companies, said Todd Jones, chief investment officer at Gratus Capital.Jean Rosenbaum, senior portfolio manager at GYL Financial Synergies, says her firm has pared back its clean energy exposure in recent months on concerns about weakening corporate earnings due to elevated rates. Clean energy investments make up under 5% of her firm’s assets.Some investors say that the slow global transition to clean energy has also dampened their enthusiasm.Eight years have passed since the Paris Agreement was approved to slow Earth’s warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, or more ideally to 1.5 degrees. Since then, in part because of the lack of specific action laid out in the plan, the more than 190 countries part of that agreement have made little headway in achieving those goals.Andrew Poreda, vice president at Sage Advisory, says that higher rates have also hurt consumers seeking a transition to using clean energy. Switching to a residential solar system, for example, requires thousands of dollars that might be sought in a loan, now possibly prohibitive due to high borrowing costs, he says.That’s not to say investors are giving up entirely on sustainability investing.Peter Krull, director of sustainable investments at Earth Equity Advisors, manages a portfolio that focuses on stocks in industries from alternative energy to battery technology to green transportation.That portfolio has overall outperformed the MSCI World All Cap Index since its creation in 2012, though its taken a hit in recent years. Krull sees the current rut in clean energy stocks as a buying opportunity for investors.Clean energy stocks also aren’t the only way investors are putting their cash to work with a sustainability mindset. Shares of Nvidia, the artificial intelligence powerhouse that has soared 220% this year, are part of Krull’s firm’s portfolio.Artificial intelligence has dominated Wall Street this year, powering monster gains in shares of mega-tech companies. Experts say that AI will be a key tool in accelerating climate change solutions from reducing pollution to replanting.“A lot of people’s impression of sustainable investing is buying solar or buying wind, but at the end of the day, it’s more about the systems that we can improve,” Krull said.",4331,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/03/investing/clean-energy-stocks-challenges-cop28/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/local/231129103056-2023-cop-and-beyond-logo-large-169.png?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,electricity reduce concern plunge load hurt action cost creation entirely global change tend act return warm director manages put potential soar supply monster share outperform thousand grow current back reserve steep hit make focus power dominate sheet prohibitive improve jones lack sustainable combat krull paris sweep agreement difficult high key drive lag technology sought officer vogue vice sage msci country senior industry cap announce give funding company underperform plan bake portfolio green pace dollar dampen future rate sustainability rosy ishares enphase earth system day biden street government begin remain president laid nextera solar clean transition client borrowing straight administration financial federal world exposure semiconductor hike intelligence work gyl lot aggressive celsius alternative advisory chain part possibly accord culprit track expert perch residential march consumer slid trade advisor loan despite fledgling relative inflation release artificial nvidia project rut specific equity rosenbaum tool weaken health campaign switch annual stock away opportunity poreda seek corporate investment powerhouse accelerate fund cash chief anytime recover degree challenge mindset solution gratus year renewable revive slow approve spending snarl manager private synergy poor complicate recent energy ideally slump elevate investor report reduction maximize sector pass bank america lid require impression slip wind assumption buying promise simultaneously price pollution index battery todd month hope firm solaredge earnings climate invest decline obstacle wall effort performance due influx headway achieve pricey interested passage capital billion balance interest,0.97855,0.0692680674209189,12.09915567282322,0.4702750582750581,0,2023-12-03
Reuters,Vietnam to investigate its central bank's handling of credit growth,2023-12-02 07:14:00,not specified,"HANOI, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Vietnam's government will investigate the central bank's handling of credit growth, the Ministry of Industry and Trade said on Saturday, after the government complained that credit was growing too slowly.Deputy Prime Minster Le Minh Khai has asked the Government Inspectorate to conduct the investigation, the ministry said in a news release.The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Vietnam's economic growth largely relies on credit growth managed by the central bank, which sets annual targets for banks, with the aim of controlling lending and managing growth.The SBV, which targeted 14% credit growth for the banking system this year, said on Thursday lending was up only 8.21% as of Nov. 22 from the end of last year and credit growth were uneven among banks.Khai told the SBV in a meeting this week that credit growth had been too low, instructing the central bank to review the lending activities of each commercial banks, another government statement said.The SBV said credit growth was low because ""the economy was still facing difficulties with a slow economic recovery and therefore the demand for loans was weak, according to the statement.",1221,https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/vietnam-investigate-its-central-banks-handling-credit-growth-2023-12-02/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FT544524SJLCNCJL63MR2Y5VSQ.jpg,Business and Economy,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,instruct handle saturday difficulty largely thursday government reuters inspectorate growth year prime banking week loan commercial respond control dec conduct target recovery told request activity trade review uneven central immediately hanoi vietnam bank economic ministry weak state slow system news aim statement investigate set investigation minster minh khai meeting grow annual lending manage low credit accord industry relies sbv complain demand economy,0.1668,0.0,11.764954128440364,0.3113492063492063,0,2023-12-02
CNN,Fed Chair Powell: Too early to say when to expect rate cuts,2023-12-01 12:53:00,Bryan Mena,"Investors have mostly concluded that the Federal Reserve is done hiking interest rates, and are already looking toward rate cuts next year, possibly as early as in the first half of 2024.Fed Chair Jerome Powell says: Not so fast.“Having come so far so quickly, the [Fed] is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced,” Powell said Friday in opening remarks before a moderated discussion at Spelman College in Atlanta.“It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease,” he said.Powell’s comments come less than two weeks ahead of the central bank’s upcoming policy meeting, on December 12-13. The Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at a 22-year high for the third consecutive meeting.While Powell and other officials say they’re not even thinking about cutting rates just yet, some investors expect cuts to begin around the middle of next year.For a frozen US housing market struggling with dwindling sales and record low affordability, loosening monetary policy bodes well for lower mortgage rates. The Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, but its actions influence them.Mortgage rates track the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves in anticipation of monetary policy moves, what the Fed ends up doing and investors’ reactions. With Treasury yields sliding in recent weeks, so have mortgage rates, and rate cuts next year would help that along.Still, Powell and other Fed officials are apparently keeping one more hike on the table in case inflation proves to be more stubborn than anticipated — but that possibility is not reflected in futures. It’s unclear how, or even if, the Fed will acknowledge an end to rate hikes in this cycle.So far, central bank officials are breathing more easily after the latest reading of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge showed that price hikes eased in October, after picking up earlier in the year due to rising energy costs, which have cooled markedly recently.In this year’s seven Fed meetings so far, the Fed has hiked rates four times and held them steady three times. December’s Fed meeting will likely bring that to an even split for this year.Stocks rose following Powell’s comments.Consumer spending and inflation both eased in October, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. The core measure of the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices and is the Fed’s favorite inflation measure, rose 3.5% in October from a year earlier, down from September’s 3.7% rise.Meanwhile, the headline measure including all prices rose 3% during the same period, its weakest pace since March 2021.Consumer spending, which accounts for about two thirds of economic output, rose 0.2% in October from the prior month, down from September’s 0.7% increase.Holiday spending so far has been robust, with Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales setting records. The Fed generally wants to see a slowing economy, since that is how rate hikes are meant to cool inflation. Economists are widely expecting the economy to ease from its red-hot pace of growth in the third quarter.But for the tens of millions of homeowners in America, what’s going on in the housing market hits close to home, since housing costs make up a big chunk of people’s monthly budget.The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to an average of 7.22% in the week ending November 30, down from 7.29% in the prior week, Freddie Mac reported Thursday. A year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate was 6.49%. Home affordability remains in doldrums, but that is expected to improve next year.During his discussion, Powell emphasized the central bank’s current strategy of balancing the risk of inflation stalling, or picking up, against the risk of the Fed inadvertently inflicting unnecessary economic damage. But he said much uncertainty remains.“There wasn’t any experience with year three of the pandemic recovery the last time we had a pandemic, it’s just unique,” Powell said. “Policy is at a restrictive level, meaning it’s holding the economy back; inflation is still running well above target, but it’s moving in the right direction, so we think the right thing to be doing now is to be moving carefully.”Powell also declared that “the public’s expectations of future inflation remain well anchored.” Most consumer surveys show that Americans still believe inflation will eventually normalize in the long run, except the University of Michigan’s.The university’s latest consumer survey showed that long-run inflation expectations rose in November to their highest level since 2011.Fed officials have broadly acknowledged that economic conditions are setting the stage for inflation to continue its descent. That includes a slower economy and “restrictive” interest rates.“All in all, it seems like output growth is moderating as I had hoped it would, supporting continued progress on inflation,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier this week at an event in Washington.New York Fed President John Williams said Thursday that he expects inflation to fall slightly above 2% next year.“We’ve gotten to a restrictive stance and things are moving in the right direction,” he told reporters. “Now we can assess whether we need to do more.”Still, the New York Fed chief said “additional policy firming may be needed” in case inflation’s slowdown stalls, or even reignites.While some Fed officials have expressed optimism, others remain unconvinced that the Fed’s job is done.Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said Tuesday at an event in Salt Lake City that she expects “we will need to increase the federal funds rate further to keep policy sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% target in a timely way.”Chair Powell is also set to participate in a discussion later Friday at Spelman with Fed Governor Lisa Cook “to hear from local leaders in the tech innovation and entrepreneurship community,” according to a statement.",6068,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/economy/fed-chair-powell-rate-cuts/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/screen-shot-2023-12-01-at-11-35-17-am-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain make widely middle economist increase thursday consumption begin waller back fed tuesday expect recovery told unclear official strategy normalize comment recent account ass progress pace market yield spending slow ahead statement march stage housing action damage homeowner college prof core speculate chief continued spelman low carefully hike job pandemic breathing forward uncertainty governor commerce week pick strip investor price slightly possibility hold public monday salt central index economic powell reading run mac bowman stubborn meaning current gauge policy city believe steady easily university fell moderate prefer future achieve williams support treasury earlier inflict mortgage hear continue quickly participate prior innovation experience eventually firm condition timely note october ten million dwindle move bring york november additional big optimism headline christopher america energy average discussion president fund consumer event loosening home descent local target personal sufficiently include expectation community acknowledge september level measure possibly period struggle half ago confidence entrepreneurship reporter upcoming freddie declare interest time tech food survey consecutive set chunk chair lisa volatile black hop robust premature show due meeting remark cook restrictive accord monetary report track risk remains rise michigan john early favorite affordability late growth year opening slowdown lake long inadvertently expenditure follow unconvinced inflation jerome broadly federal record case bank doldrums weak ease apparently monthly rate high unique close direction december leader fall split cost unnecessary influence reflect hit cyber cool balance american department improve bodes directly stance reaction emphasize held generally anticipation express table conclude slide markedly month anticipate output friday frozen reserve meant michelle stall cut economy,0.95915,0.0,10.37115044247787,0.4230756176929646,0,2023-12-01

You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.The US stock market has rebounded from its months-long rut.Stocks finished out their best month of the year on Thursday, breaking a three-month streak of declines for all the major indexes. The benchmark S&P 500 index is now within striking distance of where it peaked mid-summer, before negative seasonal trends and fears that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise interest rates blighted markets.The S&P 500 jumped 9% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 10.7% in November, both notching their best one-month gains since July 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.8% to log its best monthly jump since October 2022.Global markets had a strong month, too. The MSCI All-Country World index rose 9% in November, its best monthly performance since April 2020.Treasury yields that have declined from 16-year highs are one factor behind the quick recovery in stocks. Investors are betting — after a slew of data releases pointing to slower inflation — that the Fed is done raising rates and will nail a soft landing, or bring down inflation to its 2% target without triggering a recession.Those hopes gained even more traction Thursday on the tail of another inflation report. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge, showed that inflation cooled last month to its lowest level since spring 2021.The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note fell in November to 4.35% on Thursday, compared to last month’s close of 4.88%, the largest monthly drop since August 2011, according to Tradeweb.So far this year, the S&P 500 is up 19%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 8.5% and the Nasdaq Composite has soared 36%.“The only way I see a rally continuing is if the bond market behaves itself,” said Richard Steinberg, chief market strategist at The Colony Group.One characteristic of the stock rebound that bodes well for its longevity is its wide reach. The “Magnificent Seven,” a handful of mega-cap tech stocks, were responsible for nearly all of the market’s gains earlier this year. While those stocks have remained at the top of Wall Street’s scoreboard, the recent rally has encompassed a wider range of stocks.Long-neglected pockets of the stock market, from beaten-down financials to small-caps to cyclical stocks, have climbed higher in recent weeks.The share of stocks in the S&P 500 trading above their 200-day moving averages, a widely cited measure of market breadth, is at 60%, according to CappThesis data.Year-end calendar effects are also in the market’s favor this month. Stocks tend to gain from late December through early January, a so-called Santa Claus rally, as investment bonuses kick in and Wall Street gets swept up by holiday-induced good cheer.Still, a recession may not be completely out of the cards, and some investors warn that Wall Street might be getting ahead of itself on timing rate cuts. Traders have priced in rate cuts beginning early next year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.“A soft landing is not guaranteed. Our macro team sees the risks of a recession as low in the coming months, but they increase later in 2024,” wrote Ned Davis Research strategists in a note last month.Several OPEC+ countries agreed to voluntarily cut oil production by a total of 2.2 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2024, the oil producing group announced Thursday.Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, will lead the effort by extending a voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels per day — previously intended to run till the end of December — by another three months, according to a statement from OPEC+, which comprises the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.The kingdom’s production will stay at around 9 million barrels a day until the end of March 2024, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing “an official source from the Ministry of Energy,” after Saudi officials met with other major oil-producing nations in Vienna Thursday.In addition to Saudi Arabia, the following voluntary barrel-per-day production cuts were announced: Russia by 500,000; Iraq by 223,000; the United Emirates by 163,000; Kuwait by 135,000; Kazakhstan by 82,000; Algeria by 51,000 and Oman by 42,000, OPEC+ said.The group also announced after the meeting that Brazil, another major oil producer, will join at the start of next year, report my colleagues Anna Cooban and Elisabeth Buchwald. Reuters on Friday quoted the CEO of Brazil’s state-owned oil company Petrobas as saying that its production would not be determined by OPEC quotas.Read more here.Activist shareholder Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management has launched a new proxy fight against Disney, just months after backing off from its earlier push after returned chief executive Bob Iger announced a vast cost-cutting plan for the media conglomerate.“Investor confidence is low, key strategic questions loom, and even Disney’s CEO is acknowledging that the Company’s challenges are greater than previously believed,” Trian said in a press release Thursday.Trian declined to comment on how many seats it is seeking on Disney’s board, but said in the release that Disney has turned down its request for representation, including for Peltz.Disney shares rose 0.2% Thursday afternoon.Trian’s reignition of its proxy fight comes a day after Disney revealed a shuffle to its board, with Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former CEO of Sky Jeremy Darroch to join as new directors.In response to the additions, Trian said that the moves do not “restore investor confidence or address the root cause behind the significant value destruction and missteps that this Board has overseen.”Read more here.",5911,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/investing/premarket-stocks-trading-2023-santa-rally/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190624171745-20190624-before-the-bell-logo-large-169.png?q=h_83,w_390,x_0,y_0/w_1280",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain board widely increase thursday blight exporter click extend benchmark consumption investment begin reuters wall challenge dow barrel country fed crude soft key agency recovery warn official significant bell quick research team timing recent comment decline ministry claus factor market yield slow ahead announce proxy statement march nation write destruction compare jump card story streak darroch colony push emirate jeremy chief reveal richard management low group launch cappthesis climbed value stock strong seat rally soar produce jones data july stay behaves total former steinberg vast version wider land buchwald iger investor encompass handful price read request plan sign bonus central share quote index run brazil april intend break peaked finish representation oman gauge arabia vienna trian saudi performance believe major fell prefer treasury earlier raise continue cooban msci swept cme shuffle bond trading colleague kazakhstan magnificent note october morgan rebound million tend move bring november source big executive quarter company energy average macro oil petrobas fund reach seek misstep strike petroleum day target great export kingdom newsletter personal include anna acknowledge level measure strategist distance recession davis producer elisabeth lead audio favor tail santa confidence loom production p kick interest industrial tech range august previously disney nail financials show meeting kuwait nelson street addition responsible response voluntarily cnn cyclical fight notch accord january jumped bob fedwatch trend world report risk breadth voluntary rise seasonal comprises characteristic effort early wide peltz scoreboard late question year subscriber fear longevity strategic expenditure address top trader press stanley organization follow backing root calendar determine traction effect drop shareholder inflation completely negative release spring federal large sky slew bank hope join ceo monthly bet agree rate high close business listen medium december guaranteed return iraq nasdaq cool russia bodes point james reignition algeria pocket turn composite opec gorman month restore friday united start trigger reserve cut,0.96105,0.1522585010996447,10.689594095940958,0.4547614105833285,0,2023-12-01
Reuters,ECB's Nagel: inflation trends encouraging but rate cut talk too early,2023-11-30 18:05:00,not specified,"FRANKFURT, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation is going in the right direction but risks are skewed towards more negative outcomes, so a further rate hike cannot be taken off the table and cuts should not even be discussed, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said on Thursday.Euro zone inflation tumbled to 2.4% this month, coming well below expectations for the third straight month, fuelling market bets that European Central Bank interest rates will come down much quicker than the bank now guides.Investors see the first cut in April and a total of 115 basis points of moves in 2024, even as ECB President Christine Lagarde and several other policymakers are making the case for several quarters of steady rates to fully extinguish inflationary pressures.""Inflation risks are on the upside, not least due to the current geopolitical situation,"" Nagel said in a speech in Berlin. ""That's why I don't rule out a further interest rate hike.""""It seems to me far too early to even think about a possible reduction in the key interest rates,"" Nagel, a powerful voice on the ECB's rate-setting Governing Council, added.The ECB raised its deposit rate to a record high 4% via ten straight moves ending in September and sees inflation inching up in the coming months before coming back to its target in the second half of 2025.Nagel said the recent fall in price growth was welcome news and short term expectations have also retreated, but longer-term inflation expectations are still well above 2%.",1497,https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecbs-nagel-inflation-trends-encouraging-rate-cut-talk-too-early-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,table point policymakers news quicker rule month outcome european expectation frankfurt cut nagel nov high growth possible interest berlin pressure central euro make upside inflation voice fuel back geopolitical target tumble christine president bundesbank joachim raise early rate bank powerful council quarter extinguish retreat due april risk ecb total discuss lagarde half reduction fully move zone ten hike deposit current basis straight bet case term skewed short welcome negative direction september recent key govern inch steady price reuters situation market inflationary fall record speech,0.7815000000000001,0.0,10.060782918149464,0.3904172335600907,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Dow gains 520 points as US stocks notch their best month this year,2023-11-30 16:12:00,Nicole Goodkind,"The Dow reached a new high for the year Thursday as easing inflation data and strong third quarter earnings from Salesforce shot the benchmark index 520 points, or 1.5% higher.While it was a mixed day for markets overall, all three major indexes managed to make November one of their top-performing months of 2023.The S&P 500 rose more than 8% this month and the Nasdaq was up about 10%, marking their best month since July 2022. The Dow, meanwhile, managed to shake off a three-month losing streak, also rising by about 8.8% and notching its best month since October 2022.The Dow was boosted by a 9.4% gain in Salesforce stock. The company saw its stock soar after it reported an earnings beat. But losses from megacap companies like Nvidia and Meta, down 2.9% and 1.5% respectively, weighed down the tech-heavy Nasdaq.The S&P 500 gained 0.4% for the day while the Nasdaq was down 0.2%.Investors were also buoyed by news of easing inflation on Thursday.October’s Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, the Fed’s favored inflation gauge, fell to its lowest level since the spring of 2021. This slowdown in inflation is a positive sign for the markets.When including gas and food prices, the overall PCE index was unchanged last month. It’s the first time since July 2022 that prices did not rise on a monthly basis.A surprise drop in euro zone inflation to 2.4% in November also helped investor sentiment on Thursday.The number of Americans making first-time claims for jobless benefits rose last week to 218,000 from a revised 211,000 the previous week, according to Department of Labor data released Thursday. Rising unemployment is also an indicator that the Federal Reserve might put an end to its current rate hiking regimen.New York Fed President John Williams said Thursday that policymakers had likely raised interest rates to, or very close to, their peak.CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, sat firmly at “greed” Thursday, where it’s been since November 15. The index spent all of October in “fear” or “extreme fear.”Oil futures, meanwhile, fell even after Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, announced that it would extend a voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels per day — previously intended to run till the end of December — by another three months, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency.Analysts expect that the stock market’s strong performance will continue through December in a so-called Santa Claus rally.“Seasonality indicates that the uptrend which started in late October is likely to continue through to the end of the year,” said Cory Mitchell, an analyst with trading education website Trading.biz. While “technology stocks have a more checkered history in December,” he said, “the recent strong performance in stocks signals that the pullback of the prior several months is over and the uptrend is back underway.”",2942,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/investing/stock-market-best-month-this-year/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,policymakers point crude gauge indicator news index run month company saudi mixed cut expect shake high data oil press sentiment shot interest arabia technology loss announce trading united american euro track investor future p december make rise barrel sign notch voluntary year respectively megacap inflation level firmly performance uptrend prior unchanged state back fear john york president jobless pce analyst strong include raise indicates greed nasdaq extreme close underway food million rate earnings revise late history mark claus streak benchmark beat nvidia quarter time put production boost surprise expenditure reach santa website checker stock start accord big continue july world major unemployment low positive personal dow reserve release previously zone ease hike report november benefit previous lose claim current sat october meta weigh labor week favor signal seasonality mitchell gas drop department recent spent fed fell thursday cory exporter federal soar spring day extend price intend manage monthly consumption market buoyed slowdown pullback education number williams salesforce,0.83405,0.3059143439836845,9.78956834532374,0.4147967479674796,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Nelson Peltz renews proxy fight against Disney,2023-11-30 16:09:00,Krystal Hur,"Activist shareholder Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management has launched a new proxy fight against Disney, just months after backing off from its earlier push after returned chief executive Bob Iger announced a vast cost-cutting plan for the media conglomerate.“Investor confidence is low, key strategic questions loom, and even Disney’s CEO is acknowledging that the Company’s challenges are greater than previously believed,” Trian said in a press release Thursday.Trian declined to comment on how many seats it is seeking on Disney’s board, but said in the release that Disney has turned down its request for representation, including for Peltz.Disney shares rose 0.2% Thursday afternoon.Trian’s reignition of its proxy fight comes a day after Disney revealed a shuffle to its board, with Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former CEO of Sky Jeremy Darroch to join as new directors.In response to the additions, Trian said that the moves do not “restore investor confidence or address the root cause behind the significant value destruction and missteps that this Board has overseen.”“The Walt Disney Company has a proven track record of delivering long-term value to our shareholders and is in the midst of a significant transformation,” Disney said in a statement.Peltz in January launched a bid for a seat on Disney’s board after the company fired Bob Chapek in November 2022. The former chief executive’s tenure was short and tumultuous, sparking criticism particularly for his handling of the company’s battle with Florida and its own employees on the state’s bill restricting teaching of LGBTQ+ topics in classrooms.The final nail in the coffin for Chapek, who was chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products before succeeding Iger’s first run as chief executive, was seemingly the company’s fourth-quarter earnings reported last November, which missed expectations on Wall Street in part due to a $1.5 billion loss in its streaming segment.In February, Peltz dropped his efforts to join the board after Iger laid out a plan to slash over $5 billion in costs by implementing layoffs, streamlining the company’s operations and dismantling Chapek’s reorganization of Disney — initiatives in line with Trian’s demands.“We wish the very best to [Iger], this management team and the board. We will be watching,” Peltz said on CNBC shortly after the conclusion of Iger’s TV interview in February, where the chief executive laid out his cost-cutting plan, addressed right-wing criticism of Disney and his decision to return to the company.Iger told a crowd of Disney employees on Tuesday that he’s ready to build the company back up after a year of “fixing things.”“I knew that there were myriad challenges that I would face coming back,” Iger said. “I won’t say that it was easy, but I’ve never second guessed the decision to come back, and being back still feels great.”— CNN’s Oliver Darcy contributed to this report.",2928,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/investing/nelson-peltz-disney-board/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,walt run seemingly month ready company billion expectation ceo tenure press acknowledge contribute seek loss announce loom midst significant teach final cost board track investor restore chairman handle confidence believe rise florida spark coffin launch great year initiative vast back state bill feel guess medium oliver jeremy effort seat comment reorganization proxy streamline part stream turn include wish tv battle peltz employee earnings management request february myriad backing topic told shortly proven laid fix team stanley due reignition implement wall bid sky experience morgan shuffle interview james plan former shareholder operation crowd destruction miss cnn dismantle build criticism iger address tumultuous executive addition low nail product move share previously release decline january return gorman report darroch november misstep easy tuesday cnbc knew disney short decision earlier particularly deliver street value restrict nelson line join chief succeed strategic drop response representation key activist thursday chapek trian transformation fight fire conclusion day question park layoff challenge root record bob reveal slash push watch fund darcy,0.7558,0.2049180327868852,10.138483754512636,0.4468579736761556,0,2023-11-30
CNN,"Price hikes and spending cooled last month, Fed’s preferred inflation gauge shows",2023-11-30 11:57:00,Alicia Wallace,"The Commerce Department on Thursday delivered an early present to the Federal Reserve: The central bank’s favorite inflation gauge fell to its lowest level since the spring of 2021, and consumers lifted their foot off the gas pedal.The core Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which excludes volatile gas and food prices and is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.2% last month and 3.5% for the year ended in October, according to data released Thursday.That’s right in line with economists’ expectations.The core PCE price index is at its lowest annual rate since April 2021, marking another step toward the Fed’s target of 2% inflation.“If you look at the three-month average for core PCE, it’s coming in at 2.5%, and so that’s pretty darn close to target,” Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director at the National Economic Council, told CNN in an interview.When including gas and food prices, the overall PCE index was unchanged last month. It’s the first time since July 2022 that prices did not rise on a monthly basis.Annually, the headline index is up 3%, which is the lowest it’s been since March 2021.The Commerce Department’s latest Personal Income and Outlays report also showed that consumers reined in some spending in October.Consumer expenditures increased 0.2% last month, a marked pullback from the 0.7% jump seen in September. When taking out inflation, however, the 0.2% real spending in October was down only slightly from September’s 0.3% gain.Spending on international travel, hospital and nursing home services, accommodations and gasoline helped to drive the month’s increase. Consumers also pulled back on purchases of durable goods (cars, furniture, electronics) as well as some non-durable goods categories like apparel.Personal income increased by a modest 0.2% last month, and the savings rate ticked up by 0.1 percentage points to 3.8%, according to the report.The spending patterns last month align with the ongoing trend of people spending their money more on experiences. However, the pullback on the goods side also could be a matter of consumers waiting to see what deals may be delivered over the holidays, Kayla Bruun, senior economist at Morning Consult, told CNN.The shoppers came out in droves during the post-Thanksgiving weekend.On Black Friday at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, about 12,000 shoppers entered the megamall during the first hour of it being opened, an increase of 20% from last year, Jill Renslow, the mall’s chief business development and marketing officer, told CNN.Shoppers did shell out for the Black Friday weekend and through Cyber Monday; however, they spent less on average than they did back in 2019, according to initial data from the National Retail Federation.The heavier foot traffic, however, could be foretelling in a couple of different ways for the consumer, Bruun said.“Is that more indicative of consumers being more price-sensitive?” she said. “Or, is it a sign that consumers are actually motivated to spend?”Throughout this year, US consumers consistently bucked expectations that a broader pullback was in store for them, that they would eventually draw down their savings and be eventually tapped out.Some of the latest data on household balance sheets and spending as well as survey data seem to indicate further slowing is indeed on the horizon. Credit card balances are growing, delinquencies are ticking up, student loan payments are back in the mix, wage growth is slowing and painfully high interest rates are making debt dangerously expensive.But for now, the labor market is holding steady and unemployment remains historically low.“During the last couple of years, as we were coming out of the economic downturn, we were sprinting to recover the position that we were in pre-pandemic,” Ramamurti said. “And it worked: We largely got to the front of the pack. But we’re running a marathon, and you can’t sprint the whole marathon, and you have to settle into a steady pace.”“Barring something pretty unexpected, I would expect that trend to continue,” he said.Correction: A previous version of this story misstated when monthly prices last did not rise.",4177,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/economy/pce-inflation-consumer-spending-october/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point story modest index run tick version international america data growth draw ongoing rise make real sign renslow year wait recover level traffic matter unexpected back deal settle broader rein income mall include gasoline close food credit rate retail student development late jump deputy pull hour time dangerously economic expenditure home april accommodation drive officer enter cnn core balance consumer tapped shell accord continue bruun horizon motivate unemployment personal side reserve release megamall card report heavier purchase darn october indeed service morning labor foretell slow excludes outlay gas drove monday prefer cyber spent fed fell thursday steady spring weekend price downturn open pullback ticked initial market consumption headline gauge indicative money month category expectation couple expect high interest bar hospital historically central payment indicate pattern delinquency household inflation marked eventually marathon unchanged present remains holiday ramamurti target pce survey kayla front early buck national work pack percentage step lift minnesota marketing bank director travel told mark electronics loan debt sprint council friday annual durable hold largely slightly business spend foot experience wage trend spending painfully former saving nursing jill pretty july bharat bloomington low show different car black store furniture previous average commerce misstate mix senior grow volatile deliver favorite line consult chief september department position sheet federal increase march consistently shopper economist monthly align,0.7816,0.0718218817333014,10.17893129770992,0.3683121693121692,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Elon Musk apologizes for antisemitic tweet but tells advertisers ‘go f**k yourself’,2023-11-30 10:04:00,Nicole Goodkind,"Elon Musk, in his first interview with mainstream media since his antisemitic post on X earlier this month, apologized Wednesday for what he called his “dumbest” ever social media post. But he lashed out at advertisers leaving his platform because of rising antisemitism on X.“I don’t want them to advertise,” he said at the New York Times DealBook Summit in New York. “If someone is going to blackmail me with advertising or money go f**k yourself. Go. F**k. Yourself,” he said. “Is that clear? Hey Bob, if you’re in the audience, that’s how I feel” he added, referring to Disney CEO Bob Iger, who spoke earlier at the summit on Wednesday.Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk’s remarks.Musk made the remarks as the X CEO, Linda Yaccarino, sat in the audience. Yaccarino was brought into the company to woo back big-name advertisers.In a meandering conversation that lasted well over an hour, Musk also said he has no problem being hated. “Hate away,” he said. “There’s a real weakness to wanting to be liked.Clad in a leather jacket, black jeans leather boots, and a necklace given to him by a family member of an Israeli hostage that says “bring them home,” Musk added that it’s been “a hell of a year,” and admitted that he sometimes says “the wrong thing.”A number of prominent brands paused their advertising on X, formerly known as Twitter, this month following Musk’s public embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory favored by White supremacists.The advertising exodus included media companies like Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of CNN.But he also said his tweet, slammed as antisemitic, might be “the worst” he’s ever done.“I mean, look, I’m sorry for that … post,” he said. “It was foolish of me. Of the 30,000 it might be literally the worst and dumbest post I’ve ever done. And I’ve tried my best to clarify six ways from Sunday, but you know at least I think it’ll be obvious that in fact far from being antisemitic, I’m in fact philosemitic.”Musk visited Israel this week, where he went to a Kibbutz attacked by Hamas on October 7, spoke with families of Israeli hostages and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog.But Musk said on Wednesday that his trip to Israel “wasn’t an apology tour,” and that “it wasn’t in response to all of that.” Musk said that he is a good person but he’s not going to “tap dance” to show people that.On Monday, Musk told Netanyahu of the recent attacks that “those who are intent to murder must be neutralized; then the propaganda must stop that is training people to be murderers in the future; and then making Gaza prosperous. If that happens, I think it’ll be a good future…. I’d love to help.”But in a separate conversation at the DealBook Summit, Herzog appeared uncertain that Musk would remain consistent in his messaging.“We had an open and frank conversation which I found interesting and I think it was mutually beneficial to both of us,” said Herzog. “I sincerely hope that we will see some of [his activism against antisemitism] in the near future.”Musk was also asked about the recent drama at OpenAI, where CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the board earlier this month, only to return to his post – with a mostly new board – just a few days later. The company has said little about why the leadership shakeup happened.Either Altman had a serious issue and should have been fired, said Musk, one of the founders of the company, or the board was incorrect and should resign.“The ring of power can corrupt,” he said of Altman. “I’m quite concerned that there’s some… dangerous element of AI,” he speculated. AI, he said, can be more dangerous “than an nuclear bomb.”He also criticized OpenAI for no longer being the open-source enterprise he once envisioned. OpenAI should be renamed “super closed source for maximum profit AI,” he said.What began as an apology over antisemitic tweets turned into a meandering conversation about childhood trauma, aliens, cellphones in people’s heads and using X in the bathroom. A good portion of the room walked out before the discussion officially wrapped.This story has been updated with additional developments.",4242,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/investing/elon-musk-dealbook-summit/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story company nuclear leave post ceo source social separate conspiracy jean corrupt isaac gaza paramount trauma rise make real brand year israel officially clear back feel alien medium element abruptly rename sunday intent envision turn include altman platform close murder clarify power blackmail incorrect development request shakeup spoke cellphone dumbest sincerely remain hour time apology walk update formerly necklace admit home netanyahu wrong speculate interview yaccarino bros dance bathroom f lash hell beneficial family dangerous call murderer love israeli enterprise additional pause october hamas issue slam warner profit trip hate monday attack sam benjamin openai found fire childhood weakness x open musk wednesday bob number bring founder money month longer prominent nbcuniversal boot foolish sorry interest brought tweet stop board future concerned away lionsgate prosperous summit parent maximum comcast discovery neutralize york comment exodus portion president dealbook begin person discussion audience activism training add frank conversation told elon mutually jacket advertising kibbutz embrace propaganda antisemitism give minister woo antisemitic remark linda tour prime room refer ring literally twitter iger visit obvious public herzog consistent show head member return leather black meander drama follow theory sat criticize problem respond hey apologize disney advertiser earlier week white uncertain favor leadership tap hope mainstream response recent fact hostage advertise day immediately super,-0.9706,0.2828854314002829,6.71309417040359,0.501232782369146,0,2023-11-30
CNN,US pending home sales fell to their lowest level in 20 years last month,2023-11-30 10:00:00,Anna Bahney,"US pending home sales fell to their lowest level in 20 years in October as mortgage rates surged to their highest levels of the year, according to a report released Thursday.Pending home sales dropped 1.5% last month from September, monthly data from the National Association of Realtors showed. The pending home sales index — a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings rather than closings — was down 8.5% from a year ago.Only the Northeast saw monthly gains in pending transactions in October, while the Midwest, South and West all experienced a loss. All four US regions had year-over-year declines in transactions.“Recent weeks’ successive declines in mortgage rates will help qualify more home buyers, but limited housing inventory is significantly preventing housing demand from fully being satisfied,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.With such limited inventory, prices are pushed higher. Together with high borrowing costs, many buyers are waiting for greater affordability or have bowed out of the housing market entirely.“Multiple offers, of course, yield only one winner, with the rest left to continue their search,” said Yun.Home sales are rising in places where more inventory is available, according to Yun.“Sales for properties priced above $750,000 were higher than a year ago, because there is more inventory at this price point than what we saw last October,” he said.The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage neared 8% in October and hit the market hard.Completed sales of existing homes and sales of new construction homes, which are also based on contract signings, also fell in October.But while pending home sales were down year over year, new home sales rose from year-ago levels as buyers continued their pivot towards new construction amid a historically low supply of existing homes on the market.“While buyers continued to face limited existing home inventory, especially as mortgage rates climbed in October, new construction activity picked up, offering hope that additional home supply is inbound,” said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com.October’s pending home sale numbers suggest that home sales activity is likely to remain steady, at a low level, over the next few months as limited options and significant affordability challenges weigh on buyers, said Jones.In October, existing home sales fell to the lowest level in 13 years, remaining below 4 million for the first time since October 2010.While existing home sales are on track to finish the year at a level significantly lower than in 2022 — and could end the year with the fewest homes sold since 1993 — Jones said economists expect the market will start to shift in 2024.“Buyers will continue to contend with affordability challenges, but slightly lower prices and softening mortgage rates will mean that existing home sales remain roughly level in 2024 with the previous year,” Jones said. “Altogether, 2024 is expected to bring small affordability wins, as the market makes progress towards more desirable conditions.”",3070,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/economy/us-pending-home-sales-october/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point bring indicator index month win activity left expect region high data altogether contend pivot loss finish historically significant south demand cost track climbed housing rise make great year wait option level west limited offering qualify place successive analyst small offer national signing base pending experienced million jones rate lawrence realtor ago hit property research amid midwest remain satisfied roughly time economic slightly especially mortgage yield home buyer number course bow exist start accord inbound continue surge contract fully low soften release decline show rest report transaction sell average previous additional available closing construction october significantly senior weigh progress picked week prevent yun chief multiple drop search september hope continued shift association recent affordability fell borrowing steady supply hannah desirable nar northeast price condition economist monthly suggest market challenge winner push inventory,0.89725,0.0,12.09826247689464,0.4215363109113109,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Dr Martens shares slide 27% as the British bootmaker warns on profits,2023-11-30 08:22:00,not specified,"Shares in Dr Martens dived more than 27% Thursday after the company issued its fourth profit warning in 12 months, blaming lackluster demand from US wholesalers for its clunky boots and a slower start to the autumn-winter season.Shares in the British company, which went public in 2021, hit a record low of 79.10 pence ($1) Thursday after the firm also scrapped its revenue guidance for the 2025 fiscal year.The maker of the “1460” boots with yellow stitching, commonly known as “DMs,” has been struggling, mainly due to reduced orders in the United States from wholesale customers wary of macroeconomic pressures.For the first half of the year, the company said its wholesale revenue dropped 17% to $199.4 million ($251.9 million).“The big issue that we’ve had in the US has been our big wholesale customers, who, given the tough consumer environment, are ordering less boots and from other brands,” CEO Kenny Wilson told Reuters.Dr Martens’ classic lace-up boots, priced from $159 ($200.94) upward, have been a fashion statement since the 1960s but high inflation and economic uncertainty recently have curbed shoppers’ appetite for luxury spending and they are now looking for value purchases.The company said it had offered small discounts on seasonal colors but would not mark down prices on its flagship black shoes.It expects revenue for the year ending in March 2024 to decline by a high single-digit percentage, while full-year core profit is seen “moderately below the bottom end of the range” of market expectations, it said.Analysts forecast a range of $223.7 million—$240 million ($282.6 million—$303 million), according to numbers compiled by the company.Wilson said the company had, however, seen steady demand in its home market in the United Kingdom, as well as in the rest of Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, after new store openings and increased tourism, which is expected to continue over the key Christmas trading period.",1946,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/investing/dr-martens-shares-fall/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,fashion moderately month company seasonal classic expectation environment boot expect ceo region customer wilson tough high wary color trading demand united yellow forecast brand year inflation range state wholesale order wholesaler discount christmas small struggle offer reduce percentage firm recently million bottom maker dr europe british statement period hit told mark kingdom macroeconomic economic due give home spending kenny core blame consumer stitch start big fourth accord half continue compile fiscal penny public low share decline lackluster rest uncertainty black dm store appetite scrap tourism clunky commonly guidance issue slow value profit drop key thursday steady revenue dive warn upward luxury march increase price shopper flagship market marten curbed record opening number,0.51955,0.0,10.347029972752043,0.3563367003367004,0,2023-11-30
CNN,"How investing $100 in Berkshire Hathaway when Charlie Munger joined would now be worth nearly $400,000",2023-11-30 07:16:00,Krystal Hur,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.Billionaire investor Charlie Munger was affectionately called the “abominable no-man” by close friend and confidant Warren Buffett. That nickname was apt in more ways than one.Munger, a billionaire investor and vice chairman of Buffett’s investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, died Tuesday morning at 99 years old.Buffett, who gave Munger his nickname for often checking his enthusiasm, said Tuesday that the company “could not have been built to its present status without Charlie’s inspiration, wisdom and participation.”Munger was most well-known as Buffett’s right-hand man and one-half of the formidable duo that led the company’s legendary annual shareholder meetings in Omaha. But he was also a force of his own.If someone had invested $100 in Berkshire Hathaway in 1978, the year Munger joined the firm, the investment would be worth nearly $400,000 as of Tuesday’s close – leaps and bounds above the $16,527 that $100 invested in the benchmark S&P 500 that same year would have yielded, according to Bespoke Investment Group data. (Berkshire Hathaway shares, which didn’t have different classes then, ended 1977 at $138 a share.)So, what was Munger’s investment approach? Munger had an at-times abrupt and blunt nature that was well-documented even from his days at Harvard Law School. “Actually, Charlie was just in a hurry,” notes Michael Broggie in Poor Charlie’s Almanack – but his approach to assessing whether a company deserved his investment was a lengthy and exhaustive process.Munger bet big, long and selectively using a thorough screening process. He sought out easy-to-understand businesses that could flourish in any market environment, according to the book. He vetted investment candidates using “multiple mental models,” which, put simply, consisted of collecting and analyzing information about the internal and external environments in which the companies operated.Once Munger concluded a business was worth his hard-earned cash, he would make a large bet and leave it alone – “sit-on-your-a** investing,” as he called it. “You’re paying less to brokers, you’re listening to less nonsense, and if it works, the tax system gives you an extra one, two, or three percentage points per annum,” Munger said.His approach, together with Buffett’s, paid off in spades. Berkshire outperformed the S&P 500 during 31 of the 46 years Munger was at the company, according to Bespoke.Some of his decisions didn’t require such meticulous analysis – Munger had a deep yet uncomplicated dislike of digital assets.“I detested it the moment it was raised, and the more popular it got, the more I hated it,” Munger said at The Daily Journal’s annual meeting in 2018. “Who would want their children to grow up buying things like Bitcoin?”Your True Love’s lavish — and stunningly bird-laden — holiday gift-giving ritual is more expensive than ever before.But at least this time around, inflation’s not as piping hot, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace.The cost of the dozen gifts outlined in the “Twelve Days of Christmas” song rang in at an all-time high of $46,729.86 this year, according to PNC Financial Services’ 2023 Christmas Price Index, a lighthearted seasonal report that measures the average change in prices for the solo partridge, two turtle doves, seven swans, 12 drummers and other presents in the classic Christmas carol.The Christmas Price Index, now in its 40th year, is a tongue-in-cheek take on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index and is meant to highlight market changes over time while educating consumers about the economy.That 2023 price tag is up 2.7% from a year ago, representing a far more palatable increase than the eye-popping 10.5% leap seen this time last year.The holiday index also is running a touch cooler than its traditional counterpart, the Consumer Price Index, which was up 3.2% for the 12 months ended in October and 7.7% this time last year.Something to feel (turtle) dovish about: Even festive and unofficial inflation gauges appear to be feeling the effects of one of the most aggressive interest-rate hiking cycles in US history.Read more here.Rite Aid is closing another roughly 30 locations across the US in addition to the 100 the bankrupt chain announced last month as part of its restructuring efforts.The latest round of closures was revealed in a bankruptcy court filing with 31 stores closing in a dozen states, including seven in California, four in Pennsylvania, three locations each in Ohio, Virginia and Washington and two each in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon and New York.

CNN,Jamie Dimon says to be prepared for recession,2023-11-29 17:10:00,Nicole Goodkind,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon issued a stark warning to Wall Street on Wednesday: Inflation could rise further and recession is not off the table.“A lot of things out there are dangerous and inflationary. Be prepared,” he said at the 2023 New York Times DealBook Summit in New York. “Interest rates may go up and that might lead to recession.”Governments across the globe need more money, he said, to fund the green economy, remilitarize and to address energy crises — and that will all be inflationary.“I’m cautious about the economy,” he said. The labor market in the United States has been resilient, but “inflation is hurting people.”Stimulus money handed out during Covid shutdowns and quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve had injected “drugs directly into our system” and caused an economic “sugar high,” said Dimon. But that’s fading. “I think quantitative easing and tightening and these geopolitical issues can bite,” he said.In previous interviews, Dimon has said that the Fed may be far from finished with its aggressive regimen of interest rate hikes in the fight against elevated inflation, and that it’s possible the central bank will continue hiking rates by another 1.5 percentage points, to 7%.Dimon stressed that this may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades and that the wars in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza could have far-reaching impacts on energy and food supply, trade and geopolitical relationships. It could even, he said, lead to “nuclear blackmail.”Mankind faces huge risks, he said. One is obviously war in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. But beyond that, Dimon is worried about nuclear proliferation, climate change and the risk of another pandemic.The United States, he said, needs to make sure it has “the best military in the world, bar none.” It’s an expensive task, he said, but the stakes are high, “This is about keeping the Western world together,” he said at the DealBook Summit. “We need American leadership to make sure this all stays together. I don’t want a book written in 50 years about how the West lost.”JPMorgan Chase does business with TikTok’s parent company ByteDance and is partially underwriting the planned IPO of Chinese fast-fashion company Shein, according to a recent report from Reuters.Dimon said on Wednesday that he’ll follow the lead of the US government when it comes to doing business in China but that he believes companies like Shein do not present a threat to US national security.While some US lawmakers have said that TikTok is a national security threat, Dimon countered that JPMorgan Chase does due diligence on all of its clients.“I’m not afraid of China,” he said.",2664,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/investing/jamie-dimon-recession-jpmorgan-economy/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point underwriting mankind money company tighten east nuclear threat ceo high counter possible interest bar finish gaza united central remilitarize american shein recession chinese rise make believe worried year summit inflation israel west parent military expensive state prepared book present green directly geopolitical ipo eastern york dealbook ukraine relationship national economy percentage food rate aggressive bank change government europe stark cautious bytedance western huge bite resilient inject time economic due business wall system quantitative tiktok interview plan risk climate hand accord continue security world address fading stay lead sugar reserve diligence ease afraid regimen hike impact middle report hurt previous follow dimon decade stress lot proliferation elevate stimulus china labor jpmorgan issue street leadership chase energy task partially globe recent fed covid lawmaker supply federal warn crisis fight stake trade write wednesday inflationary market jamie shutdown dangerous fund,-0.0297999999999999,0.2252252252252252,8.429905123339658,0.4638950107131925,0,2023-11-29

Reuters,Global growth to slow but avoid a hard landing -OECD,2023-11-29 11:21:00,Leigh Thomas,"PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The global economy will slow slightly next year but the risk of a hard landing has subsided despite high levels of debt and uncertainty over interest rates, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Wednesday.Global growth is set to moderate from 2.9% this year to 2.7% in 2024 before picking up in 2025 to 3.0%, the Paris-based policy forum said in its latest Economic Outlook.Growth in advanced economies that make up the OECD's 38 members was seen headed for a soft landing, with the United States holding up better than expected so far.""Our central projections are for a soft landing, but that cannot be taken for granted,"" OECD chief economist Clare Lombardelli told a news conference.""Monetary policy needs careful calibration to bring inflation to targets while minimising the impact on growth. These judgements are now harder than earlier in the cycle and the risks of policy errors are greater,"" she added.The OECD forecast U.S. growth would slow from 2.4% this year to 1.5% next year, revising up its estimates from September when it predicted U.S. growth of 2.2% in 2023 and 1.3% in 2024.Though the risk of a hard landing in the United States and elsewhere had eased, the OECD said that the risk of recession was not off the table given weak housing markets, high oil prices and sluggish lending.China's economy was also expected to slow as it grapples with a deflating real estate bubble and consumers save more in the face of greater uncertainty about the outlook.Its growth was seen easing from 5.2% this year to 4.7% in 2024 - both marginally higher than expected in September - before slowing further in 2025 to 4.2%, the OECD forecast.In the euro area, growth was seen picking up from 0.6% this year to 0.9% in 2024 and 1.1% in 2025 as Germany - the region's largest economy - emerged from a recession this year.Nonetheless, the OECD warned that, because of the high level of bank financing in the euro zone, the full impact of interest rate hikes remained uncertain and could weigh more on growth than expected.Meanwhile, Japan, the only major advanced economy yet to hike interest rates in the current cycle, was expected to see growth slow from 1.7% this year to 1.0% in 2024 before picking up to 1.2% in 2024.",2280,https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-growth-slow-avoid-hard-landing-oecd-2023-11-29/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bring table paris news conference predict judgement expect region nov high oil growth emerge subside interest united central sluggish forecast lombardelli euro housing minimise recession make grant real policy great year monetary inflation level state hard oecd harder large target global economy projection financing rate bank development late revise told debt marginally remain hold despite economic slightly give cooperation estimate risk moderate consumer careful japan major weak deflate zone head ease uncertainty member hike impact organisation grapple pick germany current save forum soft weigh cycle land earlier uncertain slow set bubble advanced chief estate september error area warn price reuters economist full market clare calibration,0.73645,0.0,9.255,0.4625793650793649,0,2023-11-29
Reuters,"Toyota group to sell 8% Denso stake, investors want more unwinding",2023-11-29 11:09:00,Daniel Leussink,"TOKYO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Toyota (7203.T) and two affiliates will divest at least 8% of supplier Denso (6902.T), the companies said on Wednesday, a $4 billion deal that sparked investor hopes the world's top-selling automaker will shed more of its numerous cross-shareholdings.The share sale, which was first reported by Reuters on Tuesday, will be Japan's second biggest this year and the largest in the global auto industry in more than a decade, according to LSEG data.Denso, the world's second-largest maker of automotive components and a pillar of the Toyota group, will buy back some of its own shares in the open market to lessen the impact of the sale.For investors, the deal has reinforced expectations that Japan's most influential company could accelerate sales of shareholdings in affiliates and partners, a practice known as cross-shareholding. Investors, particularly foreign ones, say it hinders governance and hampers returns.Companies have been slowly unwinding the holdings for years, but the trend gained momentum after the Tokyo Stock Exchange in March urged companies to make better use of their capital.""We know it's going to free up some of the capital being locked within the Toyota balance sheet. What's important is how they're going to utilise this freed-up capital going forward,"" said James Hong, the head of mobility research at Macquarie.Denso said Toyota and two group companies, Toyota Industries and Aisin, would sell their shares in the company to investors. They intend to sell some 256 million shares, worth 589.1 billion yen ($4 billion) at Wednesday's closing share price, representing some 8% of Denso.That does not include an option known as an overallotment, which would allow the sale of additional shares to take the stake to more than 9%.If all of those shares are sold, Toyota would remain Denso's biggest shareholder even as its stake in its supplier would go down to 20% from about 24%. Toyota views a stake with a size of 20% as a guideline for its group affiliate holdings, a Toyota executive told reporters in an online briefing.Denso's no. 2 shareholder Toyota Industries would see its stake in the supplier decrease to around 6% from just over 10% currently while that of Aisin would be reduced completely.Separately, Denso said it would buy back some 125 million shares on the open market, as it looks to offset the market impact of the sale.

USA TODAY,Am I getting a holiday bonus? Here's what most companies will do as the job market slows.,2023-11-29 10:23:47,Paul Davidson,"Wage growth is slowing as the job market cools, but the tried-and-true holiday bonus appears to be alive and well. A whopping 96% of professional services companies plan to dole out year-end bonuses, up from 77% in 2021 and 57% last year, according to a survey of about 1,700 financial, information technology, marketing and other white-collar companies this month by staffing firm Robert Half. Fifty-four percent of the firms polled said they’ll offer a bigger payout than last year while 37% plan to award about the same amount. Bonuses typically average 1% to 10% of an employee’s salary, says Mike Steinitz, Robert Half’s senior executive director. Although some of the holiday bonuses are merit-based and go to top performers, the majority likely will be disbursed to all or most staffers based on a company’s 2023 financial results, Steinitz says. The survey results are somewhat surprising because the hottest job market on record has lost some steam in 2023 as consumer demand wanes amid still-high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s sharp interest rate hikes to fight it. Also, more Americans sidelined by COVID have returned to the labor force as the health crisis eases, helping alleviate widespread worker shortages. Average monthly job growth has slowed to about 200,000 from 300,000 early this year, Labor Department figures show. Advertised job openings have fallen from a record 12 million in early 2022 to 9.5 million in September. And the number of people quitting jobs – typically to take better-paying ones -- has tumbled from 4.5 million to 3.7 million, roughly in line with the pre-pandemic level. As a result, employers don’t have to work as hard to attract and hold onto workers. Average yearly pay increases have declined from 5.9% last year to 4.1% in October, though that’s still above the 3.3% pre-COVID average. Despite the pullback, the job market remains vibrant by historical standards, with many industries still struggling to find workers, Steinitz says. Unemployment has edged higher but is still historically low at 3.9%. That, he says, is probably why holiday bonuses remain prevalent. “Companies are concerned about retaining their employees,” Steinitz says. And a rising share of firms may be looking to offset smaller raises with bonuses, he says. Another company that closely tracks compensation trends, Salary.com, has a different view. Although the company doesn’t track holiday bonuses, it says 29.8% of companies plan to increase the amount of money they’ve earmarked for 2023 performance-based bonuses overall compared with last year. That’s down from 35.9% in 2021 and 34.1% in 2022 but above the pre-COVID average. Also, variable pay, which mostly includes bonuses, is projected to equal 33.9% of executives’ base pay for this year, down from 38.1% in 2022. Since the job market has slowed, the firms “don’t feel the need to raise the amount” set aside for bonuses, says Andy Miller, managing director of compensation consulting for Salary.com. It may be that Salary.com’s figures reveal a slowdown in bonuses because the amounts comprise one-third or more of executives’ salaries and about 16% of other manager’s salaries, Miller says. By contrast, he says, Robert Half is capturing holiday bonuses that are likely far smaller, perhaps a few hundred dollars in many cases. Some industries are having a harder time finding workers, or had better financial results this year, and are giving bonuses that equate to a bigger share of employees’ salaries. Here’s a sampling of the portion of salaries that bonuses amounted to for non-executive managers in 2022, by industry: Education and government: 9.6% Leisure and hospitality: 13.1% Insurance: 14.1% Financial services: 15.6% Software and networking: 17.8% Energy and utilities: 21.2% Pharmaceuticals: 21.4%",3806,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/11/29/companies-plan-holiday-bonuses/71733380007/,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,quit money month company information typically hospitality manager bonus eas high project contrast growth technology percent interest historically award demand robert disburse american health networking track worker concerned rise leisure year poll inflation force level retain equal remains feel holiday result hard andy industry harder software comprise tumble portion insurance attract utility survey include small raise struggle offer early dole work base firm million employee job marketing rate government figure payout cool director offset standard alleviate steam amid employer sample performer remain hold roughly time despite pharmaceutical staffer vibrant give edge closely wage number trend advertised equate hottest plan earmark salary find consumer prevalent accord big half compensation financial amount executive unemployment low reserve decline steinitz show share hike return different sideline average lose october sharp case service senior probably labor yearly variable slow wane line compare set energy consult capture alive september whop department covid professional pay surprising federal fight crisis widespread increase view staff mike hundred manage top monthly historical pullback majority market fall miller slowdown record opening reveal shortage dollar education,0.91355,0.0788229111928533,8.81040871934605,0.356800766283525,0,2023-11-29
CNN,"From turtle doves to lords-a-leaping, the price of the ‘12 Days of Christmas’ just hit a record high",2023-11-29 09:00:00,Alicia Wallace,"Your True Love’s lavish — and stunningly bird-laden — holiday gift-giving ritual is more expensive than ever before.But at least this time around, inflation’s not as piping hot.The cost of the dozen gifts outlined in the “Twelve Days of Christmas” song rang in at an all-time high of $46,729.86 this year, according to PNC Financial Services’ 2023 Christmas Price Index, a lighthearted seasonal report that measures the average change in prices for the solo partridge, two turtle doves, seven swans, 12 drummers and other presents in the classic Christmas carol.The Christmas Price Index, now in its 40th year, is a tongue-in-cheek take on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index and is meant to highlight market changes over time while educating consumers about the economy.That 2023 price tag is up 2.7% from a year ago, representing a far more palatable increase than the eye-popping 10.5% leap seen this time last year.The holiday index also is running a touch cooler than its traditional counterpart, the Consumer Price Index, which was up 3.2% for the 12 months ended in October and 7.7% this time last year.Something to feel (turtle) dovish about: Even festive and unofficial inflation gauges appear to be feeling the effects of one of the most aggressive interest-rate hiking cycles in US history.“Just like with the impact that the [Federal Reserve] is having on the broader economy and broader inflationary trends, this long, variable and lagged effect of monetary policy tightening is having an effect on the Christmas Price Index, too,” Amanda Agati, chief investment officer at PNC’s asset management group, told CNN.“We’re starting to see that inflation level come under control to some degree; but just like in the broader economy, the Christmas Price Index is not back to the Fed’s long-term target of 2%,” she said.The holiday gauge set another milestone: The “True Cost of Christmas” of buying the 364 items repeated in the song’s verses sailed north of $200,000 for the first time in the index’s 40-year history. (In other words, the singer is given, all told, a dozen partridges because there is one delivered every day, a total of 22 doves, or two for 11 days in a row, etc.)That all-encompassing category totaled $210,972.66, or 2.5% more than last year.The Christmas Price Index leans more heavily on discretionary purchases than the broad basket of goods and services that feed into the Consumer Price Index.However, the merrier measure highlights broader economic and pricing themes, specifically sticky services inflation, goods disinflation, soaring housing costs, rising wages and tight labor markets.Prices for five of the gifts — calling birds, gold rings, swimming swans, milking maids and dancing ladies — were unchanged; however, the costs of some live performances increased, reflecting ongoing services inflation and rising wages for skilled labor.The prices for the 10 lords-a-leaping, 11 pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming increased 4%, 6.2% and 6.2%, respectively. The nine ladies dancing, however, held steady — mostly because of “contractual differences,” Agati said, noting that PNC tabulates some of the performers using multi-year contracts, and the lords’ contract is coming up for renewal this year.While there have been some major wins for union members in labor negotiations this year, things haven’t gone as swimmingly for those earning the federal minimum wage, which hasn’t budged since 2009. As such, the milking maids’ prices remained flat once again.However, some of the largest increases went to the birds: The partridge in the pear tree went up by 13.9%, an increase driven entirely by the pear tree (a proxy for housing costs), which went up 15%.The half-dozen geese-a-laying, which have seen their prices soar after backyard farming gained popularity during the pandemic, saw their costs rise by 8.3%, primarily due to higher feed and fuel costs and other rising business expenses, according to PNC.But the pair of turtle doves saw the biggest jump, at 25%, an increase that reflects their rarity and limited supply.This year’s index also showed calmer waters in a frequently volatile component: the seven swans-a-swimming. Prices for the swans held steady, but remain the second-most expensive in the index, at $13,125.Because of their high cost and volatility, the swans are subbed out of the index to achieve a “core” holiday CPI reading. The core Christmas Price Index rose 3.7% this year, a far more muted increase than last year’s 15.4% gain.However, plenty of volatility could come in the months after ringing in the new year, Agati said.“I think the big wild card for next year is whether we ultimately tip into recession or not,” she said. “It’s the most highly anticipated recession that hasn’t materialized.”PNC still holds the view that a mild recession is possible, but it’s also likely that the United States could experience a period of sluggish economic growth, she added.Ultimately, it could all come down to the consumer, said Agati.“The Christmas Price Index is a very specialty gift basket. So when times get very challenging, I think one of the first things to go is consumer discretionary spending.”",5195,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/economy/12-days-of-christmas-cost/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1419312473.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,traditional educate meant market solo highlight limited member expensive word wild contract anticipate repeat reflect minimum monetary cpi economic popularity turtle start sticky volatility fed held leap period heavily policy set economy view dovish possible housing volatile purchase fuel item swimmingly merrier specialty seasonal swim union dance steady reading pear lavish festive impact big wage partridge driven recession ring lady cooler note touch category management bureau feel officer outline challenge give buying feed ago palatable measure maid specifically control back growth discretionary unchanged aggressive mild theme flat row tighten calmer soar tight rarity component proxy stunningly singer group pnc lighthearted tree drummer gauge twelve agati price large swan difference jump business broad index due frequently primarily represent highly water inflationary pip milestone respectively unofficial expense hold reserve negotiation earn service drum lean christmas pair card cost gold average consumer high sail major accord renewal backyard effect call statistic cycle federal level ongoing classic contractual amanda rang told chief mute basket core song increase plenty entirely asset pricing day subbed ultimately month year spending change ritual counterpart skilled win hike piper verse budge united achieve present live holiday lag dozen october run remain disinflation investment inflation broader experience time tag tip lord long performer gift show milk rise variable farm labor trend history tabulates pandemic financial sluggish report bird target north performance deliver love total state degree,0.991,0.1154956689124157,9.650701402805613,0.4530074378236142,0,2023-11-29
CNN,The dollar is heading for its worst month in a year. It’s not all bad news,2023-11-29 07:41:00,Anna Cooban,"The US dollar is barreling toward a 3.7% loss this month against a basket of six major currencies in what would be it worst monthly performance in a year.That’s good news for countries relying on imports of commodities, most of which are traded in dollars, as well as nations paying down dollar-denominated debt. But American businesses and consumers could end up paying more for imported goods.The US Do﻿llar Index was on a tear between mid-July and early October, surging by more than 7%, as a slew of positive economic data from the United States fueled expectations the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high.Higher interest rates tend to boost the value of a currency by attracting more capital from abroad into the country — as investors anticipate making bigger returns — which increases demand for the currency.But, in recent weeks, signs that the US economy has finally started to decelerate have convinced investors that the Fed is done hiking borrowing costs and will soon turn to cutting rates.“I can see two more quarters of US dollar weakness, particularly if it becomes even more clear that the Fed is going to cut interest rates,” Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of foreign exchange research at Commerzbank, told CNN.Cameron Willard, from the UK capital markets team at Swedish bank Handelsbanken, also expects the dollar to continue to fall steadily over the first half of next year but thinks the greenback will likely reverse course later in the year as geopolitical risks — such as uncertainty around the outcome of several countries’ elections — come to the fore.In turbulent ti﻿mes, investors see the dollar as a safe haven, where their cash will keep its value.“I struggle to see a longer-term dollar depreciation,” Willard told CNN. “In order for that to happen, you need to have a credible alternative… (The dollar) is still the world’s reserve currency and the safest currency in the world, and I don’t see that changing.”For countries that depend on commodity imports, a weaker dollar means they have to pay less for essentials like wheat and crude oil. That, in turn, could cool overall inflation in those economies.For example, Japan, Korea, India and many of the countries using the euro are reliant on commodity imports, said Mark McCormick, global head of foreign exchange and emerging markets strategy at TD Securities.American exporters also stand to gain because, as the price of their products falls in other currencies, they become more competitive abroad.At the same time, Leuchtmann said, a lower-value dollar raises the cost of imports into the United States, helping American companies selling into the domestic market compete against foreign rivals because homegrown products become relatively cheaper.It’s also good news for emerging markets. A number of up-and-coming economies have debts denominated in dollars, and a weaker dollar can make servicing those debts less expensive.A fall in the greenback’s value also signals better investment opportunities outside the United States, McCormick told CNN.“A weaker dollar is a rising tide that lifts all boats,” he said.A limper dollar is bad news for American consumers, who can expect to pay more for imported goods such as French wine or Chinese-made toys, and more on vacations abroad.“A weakening dollar basically makes the US a little bit poorer because they pay more for the goods they are importing, and get less for the goods they are exporting,” Leuchtmann said.All else being equal, that stokes inflation, he added, but the rate of price rises is influenced by other factors as well.“I’m sure that inflation will decrease further in the US, but the speed of this development will be lower than it would be with a strong dollar,” he said.Willard, of Handelsbanken, points to cooling US labor and housing markets as two factors likely to keep headline inflation in check, even if the price of imports rises.“I don’t think the Fed will be too alarmed at this stage,” he said.",3973,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/investing/us-dollar-falls-winners-losers/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point stage news index strategy outcome company turbulent rival nation data safest loss capital bit demand united import american investor check make leuchtmann rise sign year decelerate fuel clear equal geopolitical handelsbanken attract export turn order tend wheat economy basically rate convince development influence barreling cool team quarter election time relatively economic decrease course commodity cnn consumer start big japan continue reserve anticipate mccormick reverse french steadily slew sell october service basket essential labor particularly signal fed safe depreciation happen pay weakness korea price competitive homegrown market fall number domestic headline abroad crude weaken month expectation limper toy cut foreign expect oil emerge interest finally cost willard euro housing commerzbank credible rely country performance tear inflation state stokes ulrich weaker reliant global strong struggle raise early compete boat exchange add lift bank told mark debt research speed depend tide cash business boost alarmed poorer factor risk half swedish opportunity surge world investment major low positive product vacation head hike return uncertainty td week value uk currency recent borrowing exporter federal denominate increase greenback trade monthly india stand wine dollar,0.8865000000000001,0.0,10.463707713125842,0.3967171717171717,0,2023-11-29

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.Billionaire investor Charlie Munger, vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and long-time friend to Warren Buffett, died on Tuesday. He was 99 years old.Munger was known for his quick wit, life-long passion for learning and old-school approach to investing. Munger leaves behind a colossal legacy that extends from Wall Street to Main Street.“His impact went far beyond the investing world. People discovered him, thinking that they would learn about ways to make money, but they got so much more,” Whitney Tilson, an investor and expert on both Buffett and Munger, told Before the Bell. “He talked about a latticework of how an intelligent person needs to read and study a wide range of subjects. He said ‘if all you have is a hammer, the world looks like a nail.’”Munger, who was worth $2.7 billion according to Forbes, was revered for his pithy and often humorous remarks on investing, life and more. He often employed what Tilson calls Munger-isms to simply convey very complex concepts.His speeches and writings, compiled in books like “Poor Charlie’s Almanack,” are considered essential reading for anyone interested in business, investing or the art of clear thinking.Here are some of his most memorable musings.On investing in tech:“We were not ideally located to be high-tech wizards. How many people of our age quickly mastered Google? I’ve been to Google headquarters. It looked to me like a kindergarten.” - Berkshire Hathaway meeting, 2018On algorithmic trading:“We have computers with algorithms trading against other computers. We’ve got people who know nothing about stocks, being advised by stockbrokers who know even less.” - Berkshire Hathaway 2022 meetingOn learning:“I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than when they got up and boy does that help—particularly when you have a long run ahead of you.” - 2007 USC Law School Commencement AddressOn sitting tight:“There are huge advantages for an individual to get into a position where you make a few great investments and just sit on your a**: You are paying less to brokers. You are listening to less nonsense. And if it works, the governmental tax system gives you an extra 1, 2 or 3 percentage points per annum compounded.” - Worldly Wisdom by Charlie Munger 1995 - 1998On marriage:“I think life is a whole series of opportunity costs. You know, you got to marry the best person who is convenient to find who will have you. Investment is much the same sort of a process.” - 1997 Berkshire Hathaway Annual MeetingOn the government deficit:“A man who jumps out of a building is OK until he hits the ground.” - 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual meetingOn mastering our emotions:“A lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they’ve got terrible temperaments. And that is why we say that having a certain kind of temperament is more important than brains. You need to keep raw irrational emotion under control. You need patience and discipline and an ability to take losses and adversity without going crazy. You need an ability to not be driven crazy by extreme success.” - Kiplinger interview, 2005On problem solving:“Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward.” - Poor Charlie’s AlmanackOn passion:“You’ll do better if you have passion for something in which you have aptitude. If Warren Buffett had gone into ballet, no one would have heard of him.” – Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, 2008On mismanagement:“Invest in a business any fool can run, because someday a fool will. If it won’t stand a little mismanagement, it’s not much of a business.” - Poor Charlie’s AlmanackOn inflation:“If I can be optimistic when I’m nearly dead, surely the rest of you can handle a little inflation” – 2010 annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting.On success:“It’s so simple. You spend less than you earn. Invest shrewdly, and avoid toxic people and toxic activities, and try and keep learning all your life, etcetera etcetera. And do a lot of deferred gratification because you prefer life that way. And if you do all those things you are almost certain to succeed.

Reuters,Investors spy value in cheap Finnish stocks after China and Russia pain,2023-11-29 07:11:00,Danilo Masoni,"Nov 29 (Reuters) - Finland's beaten-down stock market may offer value for investors next year, money managers say, with a potential global economic recovery set to lift the cyclical stocks that dominate the index and NATO membership easing perceived Russia risks.Finnish stocks are Europe's biggest laggards this year, as risks stemming from tensions with Russia and concerns over China's stuttering recovery have hurt its exporters. In addition, big funds have favoured global mega caps over smaller firms, which make up a large portion of the Nordic country's equity landscape.The top 25 stocks in Helsinki are worth a combined $150 billion. Europe's most valuable firm Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO), alone, is worth three times that. The OMX Helsinki 25 (.OMXH25) has lost 10% this year, versus the STOXX 600's (.STOXX) 8% rally.Tomas Hildebrandt, senior portfolio manager at Nordic fund manager EVLI, sees Finnish stocks as cheaply valued and likely to benefit from an economic recovery he expects could gain traction in 2024.""I don't see any structural issues at the moment that would really spin the global economy into a deeper recession. Hence, I think that the bottom will be reached at some point,"" said Hilderbrant, who is overweight Finland, but underweight Europe.""We might be early in our call, but with the outlook of a shallow recession, markets will start to look for a cyclical recovery sometime during next year"".Industrial stocks have suffered from a global manufacturing downturn that started in 2022 (XWPMIM=ECI). A recent Deutsche Bank study, however, showed some leading indicators -- like South Korean semiconductor exports, which rose in October for the first time in 16 months -- are pointing upwards.A recovery should benefit other export-driven markets in Europe, although Finnish equities look more of a bargain. They suffered a harsher derating due to their greater exposure to China and selling linked to concerns over tensions with Russia.In April, Finland joined NATO, ending seven decades of military non-alignment and roughly doubling the length of the border the organisation shares with Russia.""Some foreign investors have been selling Finnish stocks after the Ukraine war started due to Russian proximity, but the country risk has declined after Finland joined NATO,"" said Hertta Alava, senior strategist at the country's top bank Nordea.Elevator maker Kone (KNEBV.HE), Helsinki's biggest industrial stock, sold its Russian assets in October, 20 months after Russia invaded Ukraine. It has struggled because of its large exposure to China's property sector.Kone's update to end-September saw orders falling less than expected thanks to what CEO Henrik Ehrnrooth called a ""fantastic quarter"" in China. Following a 14% slide this year, the stock is 10% cheaper than rivals Zurich-listed Schindler (SCHP.S) and Otis (OTIS.N) in the U.S., having traded at a premium of around the same size to both in the last 5 years, according to LSEG data.Other underperformers include cyclical material companies such as forestry firms Metsa Board (METSB.HE) and Stora Enso (STERV.HE), and stainless steelmaker Outokumpu (OUT1V.HE).Finnish industrials (.dMIFI0IN00PUS) have commanded an average premium of 28% over European peers (.MIEU0IN00PEU) in the last decade. That gap has narrowed to a 14-year low of 6%, LSEG data shows.Nordea's Alava said this group had potential to outperform Swedish and French industrials over the next two years, while the broader Finnish market had stronger earnings upside.According to LSEG, OMX Helsinki 25 earnings are seen growing 12% in 2024, faster than the 6.7% rise seen for the STOXX, after falling 16% and 1.2% respectively this year.",3691,https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/investors-spy-value-cheap-finnish-stocks-after-china-russia-pain-2023-11-29/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point peer helsinki suffer index narrow company outperform cap rival ceo data double moment south outlook manufacturing investor recession make rise great year respectively outokumpu military industrial underperformer broader length export order include bargain small ukraine versus economy dominate firm bottom earnings forestry europe portfolio property schindler quarter russian time economic novo due update link april metsa invade premium equity stock start big accord call addition share french tension stora hurt industrials sell stutter lose traction october mega china cyclical issue finland set faster perceive nordisk favour size spin downturn exposure market fall command worth indicator money month henrik european billion hertta foreign expect manager nordic proximity fantastic nov ehrnrooth valuable board country enso structural large stainless portion otis stem global kone strong border struggle offer early finnish potential lift maker bank membership roughly hildebrandt asset lseg shallow alava reach overweight hilderbrant risk strategist swedish stoxx omx underweight harsher low lead deutsche decline show ease steelmaker organisation derate benefit follow average decade senior grow russia cheaper combine nato value concern slide join gap group recovery recent laggard cheaply exporter korean deeper study reuters semiconductor trade top material fund evli,0.43015,0.0,10.66913362701909,0.3030643738977073,0,2023-11-29
CNN,"Charlie Munger, friend and business partner of Warren Buffett, dies",2023-11-28 20:25:00,Paul R. La Monica,"Billionaire investor Charlie Munger, the long-time friend and business partner of Warren Buffett, has died. He was 99 years old.Berkshire Hathaway, the investment firm where Munger served as vice chairman, said in a press release that Munger passed “peacefully” on Tuesday morning in a California hospital. No cause of death was given.Charles Thomas Munger, known by his nickname, “Charlie,” was born on January 1, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska. Munger served in the US Army during World War II after leaving the University of Michigan in 1943 at the age of 19. Following the war, Munger attended Harvard Law School and graduated with honors in 1948 and moved to Southern California, where he practiced real estate law.Wall Street mourned Munger’s passing and his astonishing run at Berkshire Hathaway.“Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie’s inspiration, wisdom and participation,” CEO Warren Buffett said in the release.“For so many decades, the two of them led an investment powerhouse that significantly improved so many people’s lives … and, in the process, they repeatedly showcased the prowess of collaboration, synergies, and common sense. May you RIP, Charlie,” said Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic adviser, in a post on X.“His impact went far beyond the investing world. People discovered him, thinking that they would learn about ways to make money, but they got so much more,” Whitney Tilson, an investor and expert on both Buffett and Munger, told CNN. “He said if all you have is a hammer, the world looks like a nail.”Munger, who was worth $2.7 billion, according to Forbes, was still commenting on global markets as recently as a few weeks ago. He told the Acquired podcast, for example, that Buffett’s decision to invest billions of dollars into Japan was “a no-brainer.”“It was awfully easy money,” said Munger, with his characteristic pithiness. “It was like having God just opening a chest and just pouring money into it.”Munger met Buffett in 1959 at a dinner when Munger was in Omaha for his father’s funeral. Munger and Buffett struck up a fast friendship.Buffett told CNBC in 2021 that after their first meeting, he knew “I’m not going to find another guy like this …. We just hit it off.”Munger officially joined Berkshire Hathaway as a vice chairman in 1978, and for most of his career there was best known as the wise-cracking lieutenant to Buffett, prone to deliver blunt advice about the stock market and economy.He was known for his pithy zingers that delighted devout Berkshire fans. “If people weren’t so often wrong, we wouldn’t be so rich,” Munger said during a 2015 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting.But toward the end of his life, Munger was often in the headlines due to controversies. Munger often spoke highly of China’s communist government, which Western governments have criticized for human rights violations. He praised the country despite its crackdown on Chinese tech giant Alibaba, which was a top Munger investment at Daily Journal, a Los Angeles-based newspaper publisher and investment firm Munger headed from 1977 through 2022.CNN has reached out to Berkshire Hathaway for comment.— CNN’s Nicole Goodkind contributed to this report.",3245,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/investing/charlie-munger-dies/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,zinger partner billionaire run awfully improve pass leave post ceo press contribute peacefully nebraska blunt journal chest vice investor chinese make real passing year officially pithy advice astonish characteristic alibaba firm recently buffett expert acquire government spoke hit serve western california economic god due honor wisdom wrong participation powerhouse shareholder fast cnn find discover stock accord japan devout newspaper move release invest report impact easy highly cnbc morning knew southern allianz showcased china decision street controversy nicole estate meeting funeral learn munger hammer market opening university father headline tech worth lieutenant money harvard billion pithiness michigan army thomas warren hospital guy practice inspiration chairman rich violation crackdown attend country school adviser present charlie comment daily repeatedly global nickname publisher collaboration age built life mourn ago told whitney prone annual berkshire born status podcast despite business death mohamed friend rip delighted omaha reach graduate goodkind praise prowess communist world investment lead january head common giant law forbes follow decade tuesday criticize dinner struck tilson significantly synergy career week deliver join chief process human hathaway top dollar,0.93805,0.0,8.889381933438983,0.4249523809523809,0,2023-11-28
CNN,"US home prices hit another record high in September, rising for the eighth straight month",2023-11-28 10:02:00,Anna Bahney,"US home prices continued to rise in September, hitting a new record high and marking the eighth consecutive month of increases, according to data released Tuesday.Even as mortgage rates lingered above 7% in September, historically low inventory continued to push up the price of a home.Prices rose 0.7% in September from the month before, according to seasonally adjusted data from the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index.Compared to a year ago, the national composite index also rose, with prices up 3.9% from September 2022, the data shows.Year to date in September, the national composite, which covers all nine US census divisions, has risen 6.1%. That is well above the typical annual increase over the 35 years that S&P has tracked the data.“Although this year’s increase in mortgage rates has surely suppressed the quantity of homes sold, the relative shortage of inventory for sale has been a solid support for prices,” said Craig Lazzara, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Unless broader events lead to general economic weakness, the breadth and strength of prices are expected to continue, he said.On a seasonally adjusted basis, all 20 cities in a separate index showed price increases in September, and prices in 17 of them are higher than they were in September 2022.Notably, home prices were at all-time highs in September in these cities: Atlanta, Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Miami; New York and Tampa, Florida.Year over year, the cities where home prices grew the most in September were Detroit, where prices were up 6.7%; San Diego, up 6.5%; and New York, up 6.3%.Cities where prices dropped the most from September 2022 were Las Vegas, down 1.9%; Phoenix, down 1.2%; and Portland, Oregon, down 0.7%.The Northeast and Midwest each had price increases of more than 5% from September 2022 and continue to be the nation’s strongest regions. The West, where prices have fallen from a year ago, remains the weakest.The latest Case-Shiller index shows the impact of strong housing demand and limited supply, as home prices continued on their upward trajectory into the early fall, said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com.“September’s index data tracks July, August and September, a period through which mortgage rates climbed steadily from 6.8% in the beginning of July to 7.3% by the end of September,” she said.Higher prices and higher mortgage rates led to crushing affordability challenges for homebuyers in September, bringing existing home sales to 13-year lows. And limited inventory kept prices relatively high.As a result, Jones said, some buyers sought out alternatives in the new construction market. New home sales ticked up in September, climbing 33.9% year over year.“As new home sales surged, new home inventory also grew to a larger share of available inventory,” added Jones. “Almost 1 in every 3 homes available on the market in September was newly constructed, almost twice the pre-pandemic share.”",3020,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/economy/us-home-prices-hit-another-record-high-in-september/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bring craig index month linger date expect diego nation region high data homebuyers separate eighth historically demand push solid track climbed housing p census rise year climb suppress typical west limited remains corelogic result alternative construct broader phoenix large york begin analyst strong early national north add boston jones rate trajectory shortage portland late breadth surely ago director strength hit mark period research consecutive atlanta cover midwest annual detroit relatively miami economic mortgage crush seasonally home buyer risen composite general chicago division exist accord continue surge cleveland july tampa low city lead newly dow charlotte release share show impact steadily sought sell available basis construction tracked grow senior oregon carolina san event drop august september continued affordability adjust supply hannah increase upward northeast weakness price lazzara support manage challenge vega fall market ticked record quantity relative inventory,0.64515,0.0,9.817192374350086,0.4305113856333368,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Don’t read too much into those Black Friday and Cyber Monday spending totals,2023-11-28 08:42:00,Elisabeth Buchwald,"How many people are on your holiday shopping list this year? Are you going to splurge or bargain hunt? Will you spend within your means or take on debt?A lot of attention is currently being given to those kinds of questions, since they can provide economists and analysts with clues into how much consumers are likely to spend over the holiday season and what it means for the US economic outlook.Even though holiday purchases constitute a relatively small share of the economy, they contribute to overall consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US gross domestic product.“It shows the psychological mind frame of consumers,” said Mickey Chadha, vice president of corporate finance at Moody’s Investors Services, referring to holiday spending data. “It’s a harbinger of the health of the retail industry, as well,” he added, since most retailers make the bulk of their profits for the year during the holiday shopping season.In good times, when a lot of consumers have jobs, shoppers are easily lured into spending liberally on holiday gifts. However, in bad times, when unemployment rates are elevated, consumers are more likely to cut back on spending in general — and especially on holiday gifts.So far, the data is making the US consumer look pretty strong.Adobe Analytics reported a record $9.8 billion in Black Friday online sales, up 7.5% from 2022, not accounting for inflation. And for Cyber Monday, the numbers were even stronger — consumers spent $12.4 billion, a 9.6% increase from 2022.During the peak hour, shoppers spent $15.7 million every minute, Adobe said.But it may be downhill from here.This year, dollar sales growth for the holidays in the United States is forecast to slow to 3.3% from 6% last year. That’s below the pre-pandemic average of 3.9% and well below rates seen in recent years, according to an analysis from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Nevertheless, a slowdown may not be as worrisome as it sounds.There is a good reason behind the expected slowdown, said Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America. It mainly boils down to cooling inflation and deflation, he said, which has been especially evident across some of the most popular goods categories including toys, electronics and apparel.However, even though the annual inflation rate measured by the Consumer Price Index fell to 3.2% in October compared to 7.7% last October, consumers have become accustomed to tightening their belts. For instance, many may put off nonessential purchases in order to have enough funds for necessities like food and gas or look for deeply discounted goods to stretch their dollars. Chadha labeled this effect “inflation fatigue,” and said it may help explain why holiday sales growth may be slower this year.That’s already showing up in some holiday shopping data.Consumers spent 2.5% more, not adjusted for inflation, on purchases online and in stores on Black Friday compared to last year, according to Mastercard’s SpendingPulse insights. But that represents a steep deceleration from last Black Friday when sales were 12% higher compared to Black Friday in 2021.It’s a sign that consumers are finding cheaper alternatives, said Tamara Charm, a partner at McKinsey who leads the company’s consumer insights hub. She referred to this as “trading down.”“After enormous growth in spending over the last several years, this urge to trade down is moderating [sales growth] increases, particularly across a range of categories of concrete goods,” Charm told CNN. That isn’t happening as much with intangible purchases like travel, fitness and entertainment, she added.But the opposite effect was true in the Adobe data.If the data were adjusted for inflation, it would show even stronger spending growth. That’s because prices were lower across the wide range of categories that Adobe tracks, the company said. It means the spending growth it reported was “driven by net-new demand, not simply higher prices,” Adobe said.The experts CNN spoke to were all in agreement: Holiday spending data — no matter how good or bad — doesn’t represent the state of the entire US economy.“That’s just one data point,” said Chedly Louis, vice president of corporate finance at Moody’s Investors Services. A report she coauthored with Chadha predicts holiday sales will grow “a fairly modest 1% to 3%” this year.However, “it sets the tone for where [economic] growth will be heading in the next year,” said Michael Zdinak, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence. And given the holiday sales forecast, he’s also expecting “some retrenchment” in US economic growth for the fourth quarter of this year.Coming off last quarter’s red-hot GDP report, which found the economy grew at an annualized rate of almost 5%, he said it would be “surprising given all the negative headwinds that we have in the economy for growth to grow from where we already are this year.”Charm from McKinsey said she sees this season’s holiday sales data as “a good indication of whether consumers will continue to moderate spending across a range of goods.”Even if diminished consumer spending growth continues into 2024, many economists aren’t predicting a recession next year.“One of the reasons we don’t have a recession in our forecast is that we’ve generally been surprised to the upside by the resilience of the consumer and we expect that to continue,” said Bhave, the Bank of America economist.That’s because the unemployment rate is still historically quite low and many consumers, particularly those who locked in low mortgage rates, are relatively insulated from high interest rates, he said. But that’s not to say that many other consumers aren’t going to feel more financially pinched in the year ahead.",5739,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/economy/holiday-shopping-economy/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point insight partner modest index company michael america effect contribute data retailer growth trading demand health united forecast vice investor recession make enormous sign economics year fitness matter back feel alternative industry moody agreement instance analysis represent order analyst bhave include bargain small tone minute economy accounting food constitute million entire rate retail expert aditya chadha cool spoke deflation urge mickey quarter reason hour time relatively steep economic especially mortgage cnn moderate find consumer accord provide continue liberally mind intelligence unemployment shopping diminish share simply finance report generally pinch purchase bulk october service elevate particularly slow profit set gas harbinger monday cyber measure spent lure chedly fell happen insulate found frame concrete price question annualized wide market slowdown peak record domestic number tamara hub belt category opposite predict tighten billion gdp toy cut expect zdinak entertainment high driven boil mckinsey interest easily retrenchment historically fatigue intangible track p currently ahead upside gift inflation range state holiday headwind nonessential president kind discount stretch global strong popular season add job analytics bank corporate travel told director electronics predicts debt friday annual online give put label financially spend splurge necessity spending attention worrisome clue general adobe coauthored pretty refer fourth list hunt deeply low lead show head account black charm gross store lock average lot senior grow downhill cheaper resilience negative psychological compare fairly evident explain indication surprised recent accustom deceleration adjust surprising increase louis shopper mastercard trade economist spendingpulse dollar fund,0.9896,0.0522739153162571,9.475381818181816,0.3828673835125447,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Why investors are looking forward to 2024,2023-11-28 07:27:00,Nicole Goodkind,"It’s been a topsy-turvy year for markets, but the S&P 500 hit a four-month high last week and a growing chorus of analysts says that momentum will continue into 2024.A few of them even believe that the benchmark index will reach a new all-time high next year.What’s happening: Investors entered this year uncertain about the economy, but things turned out better than expected. A feared recession didn’t happen and inflation eased.“2023 defied almost everyone’s expectations: recessions that never came, rate cuts that didn’t materialize, bond markets that didn’t bounce, except in short-lived, vicious spurts, and rising equities that pained most investors who remained cautiously underweight,” said Candace Browning, head of Bank of America global research.Analysts at several Wall Street banks think inflation will continue slowing into next year. They predict that central banks will lower interest rates while keeping prices stable and without causing an economic downturn.“We expect 2024 to be the year when central banks can successfully orchestrate a soft landing, though recognize that downside risks may outnumber the upside ones,” said Browning.That’s good news for markets. RBC, Bank of America, BMO Capital Markets and Deutsche Bank all predict that the S&P 500 will hit an all-time high next year.Goldman Sachs analysts added that “the hard part” is over for the US economy. They see “only limited recession risk” of about 15% in 2024.What analysts are saying: “While the November rally has likely pulled forward some of 2024’s gains, we remain constructive on the US equity market in the year ahead,” wrote Lori Calvasina at RBC Capital Markets in a note last week.She expects the S&P to gain about 10% over the next 12 months, ending 2024 at 5,000. The S&P 500 currently sits around 4,550.Bank of America’s Savita Subramanian echoed that bullish sentiment, writing on Monday that she forecasts the S&P 500 will also end the year at an all-time high of 5,000 (the current record closing high of 4,797 was reached in January 2022).Markets won’t necessarily rise because the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates next year, said Subramanian, but because corporations have already proven that they can successfully adapt to changes in Fed policy while reporting strong earnings.BMO’s chief investment strategist Brian Belski has predicted that the S&P 500 will close out 2024 at a healthy 5,100.“We believe 2024 will be year two of at least a 3-5 year process that will see US stocks exhibit more normal and typical performance, paced by a backdrop of normal and typical GDP and earnings growth, valuation, and bond yield ranges,” he wrote in a note.Analysts at Deutsche Bank also predict that 2024 will be for the bulls.Analyzing earnings: This earnings season marked a return toward normal for S&P 500 companies after the past few years of pandemic shutdowns, inflation woes and recession confusion.The number of firms discussing inflation during their earnings calls was the lowest it has been since the second half of 2021, and recession talk fell for the fifth straight quarter in a row, according to FactSet data.Analysts are predicting (year-over-year) corporate earnings growth of 6.7% for the first quarter of 2024 and growth of 10.5% for the second quarter of next year, found FactSet.All eleven sectors are projected to report year-over-year earnings growth by the second quarter next year, according to the data analytics company.The S&P 500 has gained about 18.5% so far this year after falling nearly 20% in 2022.Enticed by deep discounts, Americans were expected to celebrate Cyber Monday by spending a record-setting $12 billion shopping online, reports my colleague Matt Egan.Black Friday sales were also strong — especially online — providing the latest evidence of resilient consumer spending in the face of a host of challenges.Despite elevated borrowing costs, three years of high inflation and increasing numbers of Americans dipping into their retirement plans, consumers continue to keep the US economy chugging.It’s another reminder that it rarely pays to underestimate the willingness of Americans to spend regardless, even if they have less money in their bank accounts — especially when consumers perceive deals for the taking.“This is a US economy and a US consumer that has been able to manage through a high-inflationary environment,” Michelle Meyer, chief US economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute, told CNN on Monday.Americans are expected to spend $37.2 billion in online shopping during Cyber Week, the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Analytics. That would be 5.4% higher than last year.Adobe estimates Cyber Monday spending will increase by 6.1% to $12 billion.That Google account you haven’t checked in years might be getting wiped this week.Beginning Friday, Google is moving ahead with its plan to delete accounts that have been inactive for at least two years, reports my colleague Jennifer Korn.The company announced the new policy back in May, saying it’s intended to prevent security risks: Internal findings show older accounts are more likely to rely on recycled passwords and less likely to employ up-to-date security measures like two-step-verification, making them far more vulnerable to issues like phishing, hacking and spam.In a phased approach, the first accounts to be cut are those that were created and then never revisited by the user, Google said in May.“We want to protect your private information and prevent any unauthorized access to your account even if you’re no longer using our services,” Google wrote in an August policy update.Google accounts include everything from Gmail to Docs to Drive to Photos, meaning all content sitting across an inactive user’s Google suite is at risk of erasure.",5823,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/investing/premarket-stocks-markets-2024/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,news index company defy host information america delete environment vicious michelle project data growth sentiment pandemic announce chorus capital spurt exhibit american forecast investor recession rally rise make savita forward economics year back deal stable fear willingness part turn analyst google include phishing economy sachs close matt firm thanksgiving rate earnings change revisit late evidence hit recycle dip momentum benchmark gmail remain quarter pull resilient bond economic especially drive jennifer enter plan estimate lori browning cnn belski equity stock consumer vulnerable accord provide continue security inactive call celebrate shopping institute move reserve cautiously materialize report november current straight downside past soft service elevate recognize land issue street slow outnumber approach unauthorized perceive pain august monday cyber measure fed fell happen pay found talk deep candace bmo photo price valuation corporation intend write note market fall record number yield sector money month longer predict sits billion expectation gdp cut expect colleague high subramanian erasure interest wipe cost central reminder p currently believe rely upside ahead reporting policy pace bounce rbc performance inflation marked orchestrate typical range limited hard private employ begin discount global strong protect season suite add finding analytics woe bank corporate retirement echoed told factset eleven healthy friday hack online backdrop underestimate necessarily wall spend row spending phase reach normal brian adobe risk strategist discuss half successfully underweight investment low deutsche january show head checked account return access meaning user calvasina adapt closing grow week uncertain prevent doc chief content borrowing bullish internal federal process increase day create mastercard economist manage password rarely shutdown proven constructive meyer,0.78135,0.1545595054095826,11.137158984007524,0.4354683882009462,0,2023-11-28
