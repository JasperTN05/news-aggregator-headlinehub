CNN,Azerbaijan and Armenia agree to prisoner swap and to work towards peace deal,2023-12-08 02:44:00,Angela Dewan,"Azerbaijan and Armenia have agreed to a prisoner exchange, and to work towards normalizing ties and a peace deal to a decades-long conflict — a move the United States and European Union have welcomed.Azerbaijan will release 32 prisoners of war to Armenia in exchange for two, all members of the military, according to a joint statement published by Azerbaijan’s state news agency AZERTAC.“The Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan share the view that there is a historical chance to achieve a long-awaited peace in the region. Two countries reconfirm their intention to normalize relations and to reach the peace treaty on the basis of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the statement reads. The breakthrough comes after talks between the offices of the Azerbaijani president and the Armenian prime minister.“An agreement has been reached on taking tangible steps towards building confidence between two countries,” the statement reads.A US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the prisoner swap represented “an important confidence building measure” as the two countries work towards a peace agreement.“We commend Azerbaijani President (Ilham) Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister (Nikol) Pashinyan for their joint efforts to lay the groundwork for a more peaceful and prosperous future for the people of the South Caucasus,” Miller said in a statement. “The United States will continue to strongly support efforts to reach a durable and dignified peace.”“Establishing and deepening bilateral dialogue between sides has been a key objective of the EU-led Brussels process: today’s progress is a key step,” EU Council President Charles Michel said on X. “I now encourage the leaders to finalise the … peace deal ASAP.”The neighboring nations have been engaged in a decades long conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in the Caucasus Mountains.In September, Azerbaijan regained control of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic-Armenian enclave within its borders, after launching a lightning 24-hour assault.Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally considered part of Azerbaijan but for decades has been under the control of Armenian separatists. Armenia and Azerbaijan had already fought two wars over Nagorno-Karabakh since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and ceasefire agreements between them have proven brittle.Armenia earlier this year conceded that the region was part of Azerbaijan, but there are still divisions over the future of its government.The latest breakthrough on prisoner exchanges and normalizing ties came as delegates from both countries also attend the COP28 climate talks in Dubai.The statement also said that Armenia would pull out of the running to host the annual UN-backed climate summit next year and that it hoped other countries would support Azerbaijan’s candidacy.There is a vacuum for the summit host for COP29 in 2024, which should be held in eastern Europe, as UN rules dictate. The two nations had before Thursday been blocking each other’s candidacy in the voting process.The host country is decided by vote among nations within the region for the year. Russia has voted against several nations that are members of or allied to the European Union.Azerbaijan, which has been forging closer ties with Russia, is a major oil and gas producer.

New York Times,"Israel-Hamas WarRelief Effort Falters in Southern Gaza, U.N. Says",2023-12-08 02:42:00,"Victoria Kim, Gaya Gupta, Isabel Kershner, Aaron Boxerman, Talya Minsberg, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, The New York Times","Israel says hundreds of suspects, including Hamas fighters, surrendered across the Gaza Strip.Israel announces limited steps aimed at easing Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.In Israel, Hanukkah begins in the shadow of two months of war.Here are some key moments in two months of war.Relief workers in southern Gaza on Friday were awaiting additional fuel deliveries and the opening of a second border inspection point for shipments of critical supplies, after a dire warning from a top U.N. humanitarian official that intensified fighting had all but incapacitated aid operations.Southern Gaza had been the “cornerstone” for the distribution of much-needed food, water and medicine to civilians facing dire shortages, said Martin Griffiths, the United Nations’ chief humanitarian official. With Israel dialing up airstrikes and ground operations in the south in recent days, and roads increasingly mined or destroyed, relief efforts have become erratic and undependable, he said at a news briefing in Geneva.“We do not have a humanitarian operation in southern Gaza that can be called by that name anymore,” he said. “Without places of safety, that plan is in tatters.”Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Thursday said Israel needed to do more to lessen the harm to Gaza’s civilians. “It is imperative, it remains imperative, that Israel put a premium on civilian protection,” Mr. Blinken said. “And there does remain a gap between exactly what I said when I was there, the intent to protect civilians, and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Thursday that the Israeli government would allow a “minimal” supply of additional fuel “to prevent a humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics” without specifying when it would be delivered. Col. Elad Goren, an Israeli military official, told reporters on Thursday that Israel was discussing the quantity of the supply with U.N. agencies, but that it needed a “mechanism” to ensure the fuel wouldn’t go to Hamas.Israel has severely restricted the flow of fuel into Gaza for fear it would be diverted for military use by Hamas, the armed group that controls the strip and staged the Oct. 7 attacks. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Thursday that its ambulance center in northern Gaza had been forced to stop transporting the injured because of a lack of fuel.Since the fighting resumed a week ago after a brief cease-fire, Israel’s airstrikes and ground operations have expanded to the southern half of Gaza, again displacing the many civilians who had been sheltering there after fleeing the north in the early days of the war.Even in southern Gaza, where there has been more access to relief supplies than in the north during the war, more than eight out of 10 households are taking extreme measures to cope with food shortages, the World Food Program said in an assessment this week that was based on a survey carried out during the pause in fighting. In the northern half of the enclave, 97 percent of households are taking such steps, according to the report.Israel also said on Thursday that it would “in the next few days” open a second inspection point along Gaza’s southern border, at Kerem Shalom, to speed up the flow of critical supplies into the strip.Mr. Griffiths welcomed the decision, saying that the additional inspection point “will be a huge boost to the logistical process.” But he added that the fighting inside Gaza would continue to hamper humanitarian operations.Edward Wong contributed reporting.— Victoria KimThe first time she and her family had to move was in the early days of the war, when they fled their home in Gaza City.Ola Abu Hasaballah, 35, recalled leaving home, under relentless bombing, with her husband, her 4-month-old baby and her 5-year-old son. Describing the night as a catastrophe, she said she thought they’d be gone for a day, maybe two.It’s been nearly two months since that night. And on Monday, she moved for the seventh time in her search for a safe haven — this time to the town of Rafah on the Egyptian border from the city of Khan Younis farther north.Ms. Hasaballah described the dismal conditions she and many other displaced Palestinians are facing in Rafah, where the Israeli military has directed civilians to go. Explosions leave her and others in constant terror, while meager portions and crowded lines for food fill her with a sense of desperation.“The food and water are very rare here,” she said in a WhatsApp message. “I spent all day with a small piece of bread, and that’s it.”She said that she had waited this morning for six hours in a crowded line to get food, starting at 7 a.m. Many people were sleeping in line, she said.She sent a picture of what her family of four had been given to eat for the next three days. One plastic bottle of water, a can of beans and a small can of tinned meat.The United Nations said that Rafah has been the only place in Gaza to receive any humanitarian aid in nearly a week. Tens of thousands of people have fled there in recent days, and the city is overflowing with displaced Palestinians, forcing many to sleep on the street.After the collapse of a seven-day truce last week, the Israeli military directed civilians in Khan Younis, where many Palestinians had sought refuge in the beginning of the war, to move farther south to Rafah.Israeli airstrikes have nonetheless hit Rafah. Ms. Hasaballah said she has heard explosions since Wednesday night, and she fears for her two young children. “I am doing my best to keep them safe,” she said.Another woman, Heba Usrof, 29, who also fled Khan Younis to take shelter in a refugee camp in Rafah, said she heard several big explosions during the day on Thursday.“Today is more difficult than the previous days in Rafah,” she said. “However, the worst day for me here was the day the ground operations started on Khan Younis. Too many big explosions and strikes.”Abu Bakr Bashir contributed reporting.— Gaya GuptaAdvertisementThe Israeli military said on Thursday that it had apprehended hundreds of people suspected of terrorism, including wanted Hamas operatives, across the Gaza Strip in a single day, and that many had surrendered and been transferred to Israel for further questioning.Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, said in a televised briefing that many of the suspects under interrogation by the military and the Shin Bet domestic security agency had turned themselves over to the Israeli forces.“The intelligence we gather from the questioning aids us in the continued fight,” he said.The announcements of the surrenders and arrests came soon after photographs and videos surfaced on social media appearing to show rows of men stripped to their underwear, sitting or kneeling on the ground, with some bound and blindfolded.The New York Times has not verified the images or the video. Admiral Hagari did not answer directly when asked about the images, but reiterated the Israeli military’s goal of finding and capturing Hamas operatives.“They hide under the ground and come out and we battle them,” Admiral Hagari said. Some, he added, “come out of tunnel shafts and others out of houses. We question and investigate who among them is connected to Hamas and who is not. We detain all of them and interrogate them.”Another military spokesman, Maj. Nir Dinar, said the military had not released the images and did not know when, or if, Israeli soldiers had taken them.The Israeli military said in a statement that troops had arrested hundreds of people suspected of involvement in terrorism over the past day, during combat in Shejaiya and Jabaliya, Hamas strongholds in the northern Gaza Strip, and Khan Younis, another Hamas bastion in the south of the Palestinian enclave.In addition, the military said, an army intelligence unit and the Shin Bet worked together on Thursday to arrest another 150 terrorism suspects, including Hamas operatives, from the area of the Jabaliya refugee camp, and that they were being questioned in Gaza. The military had previously stated that its human intelligence unit was operating an interrogation facility inside Gaza.Since beginning its ground invasion of Gaza in late October, Israel has arrested hundreds of Palestinians, among them the director of Al-Shifa Hospital, the strip’s largest medical facility. Israel has contended that Hamas was using the hospital as a command-and-control center. The military has exposed a stretch of tunnel running under the hospital compound.Admiral Hagari added that Israeli forces were advancing on Thursday and intensifying the battle against Hamas’s strongholds in northern and southern Gaza, killing senior commanders hiding in underground tunnels and destroying Hamas infrastructure.The military said on Thursday that it killed a senior Hamas operative in an airstrike a few days ago that hit Hamas’s central intelligence command center. The operative, it said, is Abdel Aziz Rantisi, from Hamas’ military intelligence unit, who the military said had been responsible for field intelligence in the strip and helped to plan the Oct. 7 assault in southern Israel.Over the last few days, the military said, its forces have been fighting in close-quarter combat, killing “dozens” of armed operatives, and have located and destroyed weapons and underground infrastructure, “predominantly located inside and in the vicinity of civilian buildings,” as well as rocket launchers and tunnel shafts, including one inside a school in Shejaiya.It was not possible to independently verify Israel’s account of the fighting.Also on Thursday, an anti-tank missile that was fired into northern Israel from Lebanese territory killed an Israeli civilian. Israel said it responded to that strike and additional launches from Lebanon with tank and artillery fire, and airstrikes against targets including what the military described as a command-and-control center of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite organization.— Isabel Kershner reporting from JerusalemAmid a growing outcry over the worsening conditions for civilians in Gaza, Israel announced steps on Thursday to ease the humanitarian crisis, saying it would allow some more fuel into the enclave and would add a second inspection point for trucks carrying relief supplies.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli government had decided to allow “a minimal supplement of fuel” into southern Gaza in order “to prevent a humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics.” It did not specify how much fuel that would be, or when the supplies would be allowed in.“The amount of fuel is something we are assessing with the U.N. agencies,” Col. Elad Goren, an Israeli military official, told reporters on Thursday. He said that Israel would adjust the volume of supplies based on needs in Gaza, as long as “there is a full mechanism that we trust that this fuel is not going to Hamas.”Colonel Goren also said that “in the next few days,” Israel would open a second point to inspect international aid destined for Gaza, at Kerem Shalom, an Israeli community near the southernmost tip of Gaza, to facilitate the entry of additional assistance.Martin Griffiths, the chief humanitarian official at the United Nations, said that negotiations underway to open a second inspection site would be “a huge boost” for humanitarian aid deliveries. But he added that Israel’s military assault on Gaza has left international efforts to provide that aid in tatters.“We do not have a humanitarian operation in southern Gaza that can be called by that name any more,” he said.Israel’s announcement came as Palestinians in southern Gaza endured catastrophic conditions, with nearly nine weeks of Israeli bombardment driving nearly 1.9 million people to flee their homes, by aid agencies’ estimates, amid severe shortages of food and clean water.Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel triggered all-out war, Israel has sharply restricted the flow of supplies, including fuel, into Gaza, and has insisted on inspecting trucks carrying aid into Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Israel says the measures are essential to bar the entry of supplies that Hamas could divert for military use.Kerem Shalom, in Israel, is much closer to Rafah than the lone site where Israel has conducted the inspections until now — Nitzana, which is roughly 46 kilometers, or 29 miles, south of Rafah. Some international aid groups say that the process of sending trucks full of supplies to Nitzana and back has caused further delays in essential supplies reaching Gazan civilians.Israel has denied that its procedures are causing a bottleneck, saying it can inspect up to 250 trucks a day at Nitzana.“The problem is not Nitzana,” Colonel Goren said on Thursday. “The problem is the capability of the U.N. agencies to collect all the international assistance that, after we check it, goes to Rafah.”On Thursday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said relief efforts in Gaza had been severely impeded over the past few days because of shortages of trucks, telecommunications blackouts and fighting.“The conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist,” Lynn Hastings, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said this week. “If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond.”Kerem Shalom was the main commercial crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip before the war. It regularly saw hundreds of truckloads of imports and exports pass between the two sides daily.The Israeli government has ruled out reopening Kerem Shalom for shipments into Gaza, meaning that all supplies for now pass through Rafah.Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting.— Aaron Boxerman reporting from JerusalemAdvertisementIsraelis gathered again on Thursday evening in the Tel Aviv square where for two months protesters have called for the release of hostages in Gaza, but this time they came to mark the start of Hanukkah.Holding signs that bore the faces of the 138 people still held hostage and wearing T-shirts, necklaces and yellow bracelets that demanded “bring them home now,” the attendees said this year’s Hanukkah was not a holiday to stay home, but one to gather and support one another.“Perhaps there’s something in the power of getting together,” Julia Ferment said. “Perhaps some of this energy, this strength, gets to them.”Relatives of hostages, groups of friends and soldiers huddled quietly close to a long table with 138 candles, one for each missing loved one. Family members and friends were invited to light the yellow candles. Afterward they were embraced as they moved to the front of the crowd.The Hanukkah blessings, which in Jewish tradition are repeated on eight nights, held a new meaning for the hundreds that sang along, some with tears in their eyes, some with their eyes sealed shut, hands on heart.A few miles south in Ramla, another group of Israelis gathered to mark the beginning of the holiday at an army base. The reservists, many with graying hair and families back home, delighted to find traditional Hanukkah pastries — jelly doughnuts called sufganiyot — waiting for them when they walked into the warehouse for dinner. Another reservist had just proudly sprinkled powder sugar on top of the pastries.Rabbi Arie Levin, a father of 11 who usually works in Tel Aviv, gathered the group around the table holding the doughnuts and a menorah. There’s a lot of darkness, he said, then pointed at the menorah, and here’s a little light. He lit a candle.It was the third time he had lit a menorah that night. He had already done candles with another group of soldiers on the other side of the base and with a group of people who were living in a Tel Aviv hotel, displaced from their homes in the north and the south of Israel. Soon, he would leave the army base to travel back home and join the families of hostages for another candle lighting at a synagogue.When the menorah was lit in Ramla, the soldiers danced to a traditional Hanukkah song. In Tel Aviv, the air was still when the candles were aflame. Almost immediately, a voice in the back of the crowd started the chant that has echoed in this square for more than 60 days.“Now, now, now, now,” the people said.— Talya MinsbergTwo months ago, on Oct. 7, Hamas and other militant groups based in Gaza launched a cross-border attack in Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel launched a military campaign to eradicate Hamas that has devastated Gaza, with the Gazan health authorities saying that more than 15,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children. Israel’s military estimates that it has killed several thousand Hamas fighters.Here is a timeline of some key events in the war:Oct. 7: Hamas and other militant groups fire thousands of rockets into Israel and gunmen infiltrate border communities, army bases and an outdoor music festival, killing hundreds and abducting about 240 people. It is the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding. Israeli authorities have said they are investigating reports that the attackers committed widespread sexual violence.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says in a televised statement that the country is “at war,” and he calls up thousands of military reservists.Oct. 9: Israel orders a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip, saying that “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” will be allowed into the enclave. Its military pounds Gaza with airstrikes amid signs that it is preparing for a ground invasion.Oct. 10: Israeli troops mostly retake control of towns near the Gaza Strip from Palestinian gunmen.Oct. 11: Mr. Netanyahu forms an emergency government, adding two opposition lawmakers, both former army chiefs, to his cabinet.Oct. 13: Israel’s military orders civilians to evacuate northern Gaza, sparking panic and chaos as thousands move south.Oct. 17: An explosion outside the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City kills and wounds many people. Palestinian officials blame an Israeli strike. Israeli and American intelligence agencies say that a failed Palestinian rocket launch caused the explosion.Oct. 18: President Biden visits Israel, where he embraces Mr. Netanyahu and says in a speech that he understands Israel’s “all-consuming rage.” He also warns Israeli leaders about what he says were mistakes the United States made after the 9/11 attacks.Oct. 20: Hamas releases two American hostages held in Gaza, Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, after negotiations involving officials in Qatar. Days later, it releases two more hostages, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and, Nurit Cooper, 79.Oct. 27: Amid heavy airstrikes, and shrouded in secrecy and ambiguity, Israel launches a ground invasion into north Gaza from three directions. Cellphone and internet service in the enclave is cut off.Oct. 31: Israel’s military strikes the Jabaliya neighborhood north of Gaza City with two 2,000-pound bombs, killing dozens of people and wounding hundreds, according to Gazan health officials. Israel says it was targeting a Hamas commander.Nov. 6: Israel’s military says it has effectively surrounded Gaza City and split Gaza into north and south.Nov. 15: Israel’s military storms Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which it says doubles as a Hamas military command center, an allegation that Hamas denies. Israel later says it discovered weapons and other evidence that supports its assertions that Hamas operated in a network of tunnels under the complex.Nov. 24: Israel and Hamas pause fighting in a deal that allows for the release of 102 hostages and for more than 200 Palestinians held in Israeli jails over the course of several days. It also allows for the delivery of more aid to Gaza’s civilians.Dec. 2: The truce collapses. The Israeli military heavily bombards southern Gaza, claiming to strike more than 400 targets, and orders residents to evacuate several towns and villages, spreading confusion and fear as people sought shelter.Dec. 5: The Israeli military describes house-to-house gun battles with Hamas fighters in the southern city of Khan Younis. Civilians and aid workers describe some of the heaviest bombardment of the conflict and deteriorating humanitarian conditions.— Matthew Mpoke BiggAdvertisementReporting inside Gaza is extremely challenging right now. Israel has prevented journalists from entering the region except when accompanied by its military, and then only under certain conditions, while Egypt, along its border, is also blocking access. Communications have been limited, in part because of the Israeli siege of the enclave. Many Palestinian journalists in Gaza have been killed in airstrikes. And even before the war, Hamas restricted what reporters could cover in Gaza, limiting their movement, interrogating their sources and translators and expelling foreign reporters for work deemed objectionable.The Times, along with other news organizations, has asked the governments of Israel and Egypt for direct access to Gaza because reporting on the ground is vital to understanding this crisis. Throughout the war, The Times has been working with journalists who were already in Gaza when the siege began. We have been interviewing residents and officials in Gaza by phone and using digital apps. We have asked people in the area to share their stories with us on video, which we then confirm are real. We also verify photos and social media posts using similar techniques, scrutinizing them to determine where and when they were taken or written and cross-checking with other sources, such as satellite imagery. We cross reference any information we gather with interviews with the U.N. and other international organizations, many of which have employees in different parts of Gaza.In general, we try to avoid relying on a single source and we seek to include detailed information whenever possible.— The New York

CNN,Italy quits Belt and Road plan as Europe rethinks China relations,2023-12-08 02:38:00,Simone McCarthy,"Italy, the only G7 country to join China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative, will leave the global infrastructure program when its contract expires next year - the latest sign of hardening European attitudes to Beijing and its global ambitions.Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday confirmed the widely expected move, a campaign pledge during her run for office last year amid complaints the deal signed with China by a previous government in 2019 had brought few benefits to Italy’s economy.Meloni stressed however that Rome could maintain good ties with Beijing outside the program, which has expanded China’s global influence while raising concerns it has saddled some countries with unmanageable debt.“I think that we should … improve our cooperation with China on trade, the economy,” Meloni told reporters, according to Reuters, in her first public comments on the issue after reports Italy had told China of its decision not to extend the pact after it expires in March 2024.“The tool of the (BRI) … has not produced the results that were expected,” she added.Italy’s move comes as the European Union has embarked on a campaign to “de-risk” its supply chains from China’s and secure sensitive technologies after the bloc deemed Beijing a “systemic rival” in 2019.Those frictions were on show Thursday during a summit between EU heads and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, where the two sides grappled with points of contention from trade to Russia’s war in Ukraine - with little concrete progress made.China’s Foreign Ministry took a measured tone when asked about the Italian withdrawal during a regular press briefing Thursday, pointing to the “enormous appeal and global influence of Belt and Road cooperation.”“China firmly opposes attempts to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation or stoke bloc confrontation and division,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, without referring directly to Italy.China has inked agreements with what it says are more than 140 countries for partnership on the program, which has funneled hundreds of billions of dollars into roads, ports, airports and bridges, largely across the Global South over the past decade.Italy’s decision to join the scheme in 2019 was widely seen at the time as a diplomatic win for Beijing – and drew criticism from Washington and Brussels.In an interview with newspaper Corriere della Sera this summer, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto branded the 2019 decision as “wicked,” citing growing trade imbalances between the two countries.China imported $26.9 billion in Italian goods last year, compared with $21.4 billion in 2019. By contrast, Chinese exports to Italy rose to $50.5 billion from $33.5 billion over the same period, according to China’s customs data.Rome joined the scheme under former China-friendly Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who condemned the withdrawal in an interview posted to his Facebook page, saying it was made for “ideological reasons” and risked “scuppering” potential expansion of Italian exports.Chinese Ambassador to Italy Jia Guide earlier this year in an interview with Italian news outlet Fanpage suggested a “reckless” decision to withdraw from the pact would have a “negative” impact on cooperation.Italian leaders have appeared keen to navigate the withdrawal carefully, with Meloni repeatedly suggesting it was possible to have good relations with China outside the Belt and Road plan. She has also previously denied speculation that the United States pressured her to quit the scheme.The news of Rome’s withdrawal came as the delegation of top European Union officials arrived in Beijing for the first in-person EU-China summit in four years.The meeting was seen by Chinese leaders as a key opportunity to smooth contentious relations with Europe, which Beijing continues to see as a key potential counterweight in its competition with the United States.“We should not view each other as rivals just because our systems are different, reduce cooperation because competition exists, or engage in confrontation because there are disagreements,” Xi told the visiting leaders, according to China’s official readout.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel pressed Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the gaping trade deficit between their economies and “unfair competition,” while Li urged the EU to be “prudent” in its use of “restrictive” economic policies.Though the summit appeared to do little to resolve key issues, Von der Leyen said it saw both sides agree “that it is in our joint interest to have balanced trade relations.”The EU side would be looking for “concrete progress following these discussions,” the bloc said in a statement after the meeting.",4743,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/08/china/italy-belt-and-road-eu-china-summit-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220831104615-simone-mccarthy-byline-2022.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country european ursula raise reason refer top crosetto navigate win continue russia public resolve urge partnership side improve suggest bridge reckless competition economic port reduce newspaper appeal giorgia interview compare corriere concrete sensitive leave view china italy system maintain relation deal keen gap amid told key negative expand contentious qiang global repeatedly head reporter deny move accord prime friction benefit guido potential late past technology flagship extend smear saddle produce measure deficit meeting supply commission bloc guide sign reuters agree page custom confirm funnel facebook leyen period former press scheme wang year rome harden post inked follow complaint condemn wicked enormous result report spokesperson drew chain pledge belt official leader interest airport export withdraw expires prudent speculation firmly visit dollar program outlet defense charles unfair make xi europe giuseppe discussion imbalance possible unmanageable exists foreign expansion joint brand italian expect division withdrawal concern largely influence contract opportunity tie plan criticism road carefully united diplomatic secure attitude campaign previous pressure directly jinping president stoke economy summit hundred progress different restrictive minister comment stress smooth counterweight infrastructure grapple serum delegation rival wenbin state trade risk join opposes import union quit cooperation decision regular confrontation earlier fanpage grow jia systemic michel meloni sabotage scupper embark conte run engage disagreement council contrast tool point impact government previously arrive initiative ideological balance widely contention chinese time thursday statement brought issue washington office ministry news beijing show agreement tone summer bri ukraine march south pact attempt ambassador billion rise deem premier briefing,0.5226999999999999,0.0632511068943706,12.224009546539378,0.3595844296548523,0,2023-12-08
ABC,"Bloodshed, fear, hunger, desperation: Palestinians try to survive war's new chapter in southern Gaza",2023-12-08 01:47:00,"ISABEL DEBRE Associated Press, SAMY MAGDY Associated Press, and NAJIB JOBAIN Associated Press","RAFAH, Gaza Strip -- The roads are so ravaged that the dead and wounded arrive by donkey cart. Desperate relatives rush bloodied and dust-covered people, many of them children, to the hospital.Naseem Hassan, a 48-year-old Palestinian medic in the Gaza Strip's southern town of Khan Younis, said it had become impossible to walk through Nasser Hospital, with people spread out everywhere. Some patients, terrified or semiconscious, tugged at his sleeve when he squeezed through the halls. They groaned, slept and died on those bloodstained floors, he said.His skeletal staff at the 350-bed hospital has struggled to cope with an influx of over 1,000 patients. Without fresh bandages and gauze, Doctors Without Borders said, patients’ wounds have become seriously infected, in many cases septic.“When I think about it for a moment, I start to cry,” Hassan said by phone, struggling to be heard over the shouts of the doctors and nurses who remained. “It's a good thing I'm too tired to think.”On Dec. 7, United Nations monitors said the hospital received its first delivery of supplies since Nov. 29. The World Health Organization delivered trauma and emergency care supplies to the area for about 4,500 patients.In recent days, Israeli tanks have rumbled into southern Gaza, starting with Khan Younis. It's the opening of a grim new chapter in a war that has already killed over 17,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and displaced what the United Nations estimates to be 1.9 million people. The war — which erupted when Hamas militants rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and abducting more than 240 others — has severely damaged or destroyed as much as 36% of all the buildings across the entire enclave, according to analysis of publicly available satellite imagery from the European Earth observation program Copernicus taken Wednesday.Those who took refuge in southern Gaza from the military campaign that reduced the north to rubble over the past two months now find themselves stuck in a cramped, desperate patch of ever-shrinking land as Israel expands its invasion.“The suffering is really apocalyptic,” said Khaled Abu Shaban, 38, an aid worker near Khan Younis. Israel's intensive shelling has forced agonizing choices, he said. Should he venture out to the supermarket or search for well water, at risk of being killed? Or should he let his young daughters go to sleep hungry and thirsty?His 7-year-old cheered Wednesday, he said, when he brought home a tomato. “It is unacceptable that we are searching for water and anything that we can chew in the 21st century.""The pitched street battles and heavy bombardment have blocked aid groups from delivering vital supplies in Khan Younis, the U.N. said, where hungry families are sometimes streets away from warehouses full of food.On Tuesday, desperate mobs stormed a warehouse where two days' worth of food aid had piled up before distribution, the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency, known as UNRWA, said, lamenting the dangers that stalled delivery. People snatched whatever they could and ran off with sacks of flour.“The hunger war has started,” said Nawras Abu Libdeh, a worker in Khan Younis with the humanitarian organization Medical Aid for Palestinians. “And this is the worst of all wars.”In central Gaza, which has been so far spared Israel’s ground invasion, residents said thousands of jostling Palestinians pounce on aid trucks the moment they arrive, screaming for food and ripping into packages.“There are 8,000 people in this shelter, and any vegetables disappear before I see them because people seize everything so fast,” said Mazen Junaid, a father of six who fled to the central city of Deir al-Balah from northern Gaza. The swelling crowds, he said, make it difficult to breathe and move.The prices of staple foods have ballooned out of reach, residents said, with a bag of flour now some 450 shekels ($121). Sugar, emptied from supermarkets, goes for about 40 shekels ($10) on the black market. Rare wartime luxuries savored over the past few weeks — coffee, eggs, biscuits — have vanished. Without cooking gas, Palestinians chop down whatever trees they find for firewood.“There is hunger, there is nothing: There is no flour, no water,"" said Etimad Hassan, who sleeps pressed together with 21 family members in a small tent in Deir al-Balah. Her voice trembled with rage. “We are not animals. Why do they put us in tents like dogs? At least guarantee us a place for shelter.""Adding to the misery, there is little to no treatment available for the 14% of Gaza's population suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic heart conditions, said the World Health Organization.“Asthmatics do not find inhalers. Diabetics do not find insulin,” said Ebraheem Matar, a doctor at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. “Hypertensive patients do not find receptor blockers.""Hassan said her husband abruptly stopped taking his blood pressure medication when he ran out, a withdrawal doctors warned would increase his risk of heart attack. “I’m worried it will kill him,” she said.Junaid said he spends his days begging for food in the streets and scouring pharmacies and health clinics for any anti-inflammatory medication to blunt his throbbing headaches. He checked five pharmacies Thursday and returned home empty-handed.“We didn’t start this war,"" he said. “What will I do, leave my daughters to die in it?”Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, many of whom already fled fighting two or three times, have set off for the southern city of Rafah on the Egyptian border. The Israeli military air-dropped fliers and called and texted evacuation warnings to thousands of civilians across Khan Younis while pressing deeper into the city.Misery spans the horizon in the southern border town. Thousands of people sleep in the cold outside. Others crowd together wherever they find space.“You find displaced people in the streets, in schools, in mosques, in hospitals,"" said Hamza Abu Mustafa, a schoolteacher in Rafah. ""You find displaced families everywhere.”Chaotic scenes of sickness and filth unfold at the U.N. shelters in Rafah, bursting at the seams. The U.N. humanitarian office said Wednesday that poor sanitation has led to rampant cases of scabies, lice and diarrhea, raising fears that more serious diseases may soon spread. Aid workers have reported outbreaks of the liver disease hepatitis A.In Nasser Hospital, the walls thrum with the thunder of battles raging nearby. Hassan, the medic, said his wife, four young daughters and son pleaded with him to join their flight to Rafah.But Hassan has refused, vowing to persist through the grim routine that drains and haunts him more each day.“My patients come here because they put their faith in international law. They come to hospitals for care and safety,” he said. “I won't leave them even if tanks tear down this hospital.""___",6938,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bloodshed-fear-hunger-desperation-palestinians-survive-wars-new-105488570,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/43143da2-d3d6-43ca-a5dd-7f744f353877/wirestory_4da8410ab2e849adef8aff18c79b310c_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,european ebraheem heard khan raise enclave available inhaler increase hunger condition wound ravage treatment return relative refuge blood militant bandage unacceptable pounce satellite khaled agonize daughter skeletal patient imagery spends scream rare asthmatic tear beg stop guarantee cooking monitor refugee balloon sanitation rumble diabetes severely century intensive doctor agency reduce cramped husband scour warn hall tomato cry moment population full earth nawras leave snatch tent disease diabetic haunt receptor jostling poor difficult struggle shaban start receive louse put law damage day stuck hamza unfold gas storm chronic staple nasser remain slept sickness child displace school reach bursting groan wednesday liver emergency shekel sleeve worried mustafa bloodstained bloody squeeze nurse deliver libdeh accord warning filth outbreak patch mob military worker nation influx past stall price checked small bag gaza southern crowd cold estimate pharmacy floor savor supply fast rip suffer set medic infect million home headache north scene sleep spread young tremble international market truck spar wall israeli border texted rubble disappear fight safety search press ran martyr grim resident sack span dead palestinian away member hassan supermarket shout report tree water expands swell semiconscious flee tire etimad flier chop desperate copernicus junaid shelter central seam rage drain misery nearby vow case program kill rampage pile attack shell blunt town force thirsty scabies make wife mazen flight aid ten analysis hamas city chew heavy withdrawal opening rush fresh medical refuse mosque road egg recent egyptian united family abruptly fear seize northern vegetable wartime israel vanished campaign destroyed pressure pitch tuesday month land younis deir rag humanitarian add empty publicly medication group matar walk diarrhea clinic thrum find erupt phone black flour building ground week lead plead strip thunder risk heart place horizon join street luxury worth gauze food animal high abu bombardment staff schoolteacher apocalyptic entire cope insulin abduct sugar deeper trauma danger donkey hospital lament tank vital unrwa father arrive world warehouse impossible cheer venture health time delivery thursday breathe brought throb distribution blocker office ministry voice rafah invasion hepatitis coffee thousand cart faith evacuation block biscuit chaotic persist battle rampant routine terrify hypertensive hungry observation tug choice chapter call organization area civilian,-0.99875,0.345921014701643,9.25951515151515,0.4294767115600448,0,2023-12-08

ABC,"A Chinese military surveillance balloon is spotted in Taiwan Strait, island's Defense Ministry says",2023-12-08 00:09:00,The Associated Press,"TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan’s Defense Ministry says a Chinese military surveillance balloon was spotted in the Taiwan Strait, as well as a large-scale movement of military aircraft and ships.The ministry said the balloon passed southwest of the northern port city of Keelung on Thursday night, then continued east before disappearing, possibly into the Pacific Ocean.However, there seemed to some uncertainty about whether the balloon was operated directly by the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of China's ruling Communist Party. The ministry referred to it both as a “”PLA surveillance balloon"" and as “1 PRC's balloon,"" using the acronym for the People's Republic of China, China's official name.A Defense Ministry spokesperson said they had no additional information.China has long blurred the lines between military and civilian functions, including in the South China Sea, where it operates a huge maritime militia — ostensibly civilian fishing boats that act under government orders to assert Beijing's territorial claims.Taiwan has threatened to shoot down such balloons, but the ministry did not say what, if any, action was taken. It said the balloon was monitored flying at an altitude of approximately 6,400 meters (21,000 feet).It also said 26 Chinese military aircraft were detected, along with 10 Chinese navy ships, in the 24 hours before 6 a.m. Friday. Of the aircraft, 15 had crossed the median line that is an unofficial divider between the sides, but which Beijing refuses to recognize. Some also entered Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone outside the island's airspace, which encompasses the 160 kilometer (100 mile) - wide Taiwan Strait.Taiwan’s military monitored the situation with combat aircraft, navy vessels and land-based missile systems, the ministry said. The incident came just over month before Taiwan is to hold elections for president and the legislature and raises questions about possible Chinese efforts to influence the vote.Such incursions occur regularly as a means of advertising China’s threat to use force to annex the self-governing island republic it considers its own territory, wear down Taiwan’s military capabilities, and impact morale among the armed forces and the public, who remain largely ambivalent to China’s actions.The Chinese missions have also prompted Taiwan to up its purchases of aircraft from the United States, its chief ally, and revitalize its own defense industry, including producing submarines.Beijing strongly protests all contacts between the island and the U.S., but its aggressive diplomacy has helped build strong bipartisan support for Taipei on Capitol Hill.U.S. President Joe Biden vowed sharper rules to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown aerial objects after three weeks of high-stakes drama sparked by the discovery of a suspected Chinese spy balloon transiting much of the country early in the year.",2928,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chinese-military-surveillance-balloon-spotted-taiwan-strait-islands-105487719,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/6e950201-c4bd-4e17-bb6b-ef3605dca916/wirestory_cb16e57f0be3fd77fc4ed52f6122a1a4_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country advertising meter raise boat army ally refer enter fly encompasses unofficial capability divider operate defense strongly huge line threaten ruling altitude public vowed threat party force track side official chief liberation monitor wide long spot balloon vessel possible continued city annex purchase port largely early air communist influence branch regularly refuse zone airspace united strong acronym industry function hour rule diplomacy situation considers northern drama effort china discovery support transit movement directly navy system ship month president wear identification question aerial taiwan remain incursion incident week state suspect surveillance approximately keelung combat southwest biden aggressive occur fishing militia contact sharper cross include pacific kilometer foot operates military island republic impact government recognize night produce build protest taipei territorial uncertainty assert possibly revitalize chinese thursday ostensibly order action hold bipartisan capitol joe additional mission ministry spark beijing potentially median strait disappear legislature aircraft unknown friday east blur election year shoot arm detect mile pla object south prc act maritime spy prompt spokesperson missile territory pass civilian ambivalent,-0.06405,0.0,12.702450592885372,0.3528512028512027,0,2023-12-08
CNN,"December 7, 2023 Israel-Hamas war",2023-12-08 00:00:00,Kathleen Magramo,"Our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war has moved here.Editor’s Note: The following post includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.Simchat Greyman had to pause several times when describing the evidence of sexual violence he saw when recovering the bodies of victims of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel.One body was so severely brutalized that he and his colleagues from ZAKA, the ultra-orthodox Jewish human remains recovery organization, couldn’t tell whether it was a man or a woman.Greyman described finding a woman who was shot in the back of her head, lying on her bed, naked from her waist down. A live grenade was planted in her hand.And then there was the body with the nails.“I was called into a house, I was told there are few bodies over there. I saw in front of my eyes a woman, laying (down). She was naked and she had nails …,” Greyman managed to say before pausing for a long time, struggling to get the words out.“She had nails and different objects in her female organs. Her body was brutalized in a way that we could not identify her,” he added, the trauma clearly visible on his face.Greyman was testifying at a United Nations session on sexual and gender-based violence in the October 7 Hamas terror attack, hosted by Israel at the UN headquarters in New York on Monday.He was one of several eyewitnesses invited to address the meeting, providing evidence that sexual violence and rape occurred and were weaponized by Hamas during the attacks.CNN cannot independently verify individual allegations and claims. However, several first responders who attended the scenes of the October 7 attack told CNN the attacks were overwhelmingly gruesome and that some female victims were found undressed.The evidence of sexual violence presented during the session at the UN was ample and overwhelming and came from different sources.While Greyman spoke about his experience from the search and rescue operations, Yael Richert, a superintendent with the Israel Police, shared information gathered during the investigation so far.She said survivors of the terror attack told investigators they witnessed Hamas terrorists perpetrating sexual violence against the victims. She quoted testimonies of several individuals all of whom either directly witnessed sexual violence or saw clear evidence of it.Read more about the rape and sexual violence inflicted by HamasThe humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate in Gaza as Israeli forces expand their operations throughout the Palestinian enclave.Since Tuesday, the military has been operating in the southern city of Khan Younis, engaged in “intense battles” with Hamas fighters.The conflict has caused “unimaginable loss, destruction and misery” and “everyone in Gaza is hungry,” the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said.Israel’s security cabinet on Wednesday approved a “minimal” increase in the amount of fuel entering Gaza, but global leaders and aid groups say there needs to be much more assistance entering the enclave.Here’s what to know:The Israeli military in the early hours of Friday local time responded to an allegation that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deployed white phosphorus in southern Lebanon on Thursday.The Lebanon National News Agency (NNA) alleged Thursday that Israeli artillery shelled the outskirts of the town of Rmeish, south Lebanon, with “phosphorus.”Video obtained by CNN shows columns of white smoke above the outskirts of the hilltop town. CNN is unable to confirm the use of phosphorous munitions.In a statement to CNN, the IDF said that it “only legal weapons and ammunition.”Is white phosphorus illegal? Under an international protocol ratified by Israel in 1995, the use of such incendiary weapons is allowed when “not specifically designed to cause burn injury to persons,” CNN previously reported.There is no prohibition, per se, against white phosphorus in conflict. But the timing and location of its use are restricted.For example, it is illegal under the protocol to use white phosphorus against any personnel, civilian or military. It can be directed only against military targets. International law says incendiary weapons cannot be used where civilians are concentrated.Israel’s history with white phosphorus: Israel previously faced widespread criticism for firing white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during a Gaza offensive that began in late 2008. HRW said in a 2009 report that Israel’s white phosphorus munitions had killed and injured civilians and damaged civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse, and a hospital. HRW claimed that Israel’s use of the weapons in crowded neighborhoods “violated international humanitarian law (the laws of war), which requires taking all feasible precautions to avoid civilian harm and prohibits indiscriminate attacks.”In response, Israel pledged to limit the use of white phosphorus and make greater efforts to protect civilians during conflicts. Still, the government said that it had used white phosphorus lawfully.Claim of recent use: In October, Human Rights Watch accused Israeli forces of using white phosphorus during military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.According to the HRW report, the rights group said it verified one video taken on October 10 in Lebanon and another video in Gaza on October 11 that it claimed shows “multiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border.”Israel denied the claims by Human Rights Watch.An Israeli man presumed to have been held hostage in Gaza was killed on October 7 when Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel, his kibbutz announced in a statement Thursday.Kibbutz Be’eri announced the death of resident Dror Kaplun, 68, but did not specify when Israeli authorities informed the kibbutz about his death.It is not clear where he was killed.CNN has reached out to the Israeli prime minister’s office for more details.His wife, Marcel Frailich Kaplun, was also killed on October 7, the kibbutz said at the time.After the October 7 attack, the hostages’ families forum released a statement saying his children saw a video in which Kaplun and his wife were seen taken by militants and tied up toward the fence of the kibbutz.Egypt will not let Palestinians temporarily relocate to the country while Israel carries out its military operation in the Gaza Strip because it would be a violation of international humanitarian law, the foreign minister said Thursday.Some context: The United States has also objected to any efforts to move Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip. Vice President Kamala Harris said in a meeting Saturday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi that Washington will not allow for the forced relocation of Palestinians or any redrawing of the current border of the Gaza Strip.“Under no circumstances will the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, the besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza,” Harris said, according to a statement from the vice president’s office.More from the interview: Earlier Thursday, the Egyptian Authority for Crossings and Borders published a list of dozens of foreign nationals set to leave Gaza. Pressed on why it took so long to get those people out of the enclave, Shoukry said it’s all contingent on agreements.“It is totally up to Israelis to define and to provide the lists of those who can come out, and when they do we facilitate the repatriation. So, this is all to maintain the Rafah crossing, not to affect at all the flow of humanitarian assistance,” Shoukry told CNN.The list included more US citizens alongside nationals of Romania, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. It also includes 13 United Nations personnel intending to enter Gaza.Shoukry also said he thinks “it is necessary for the Palestinian people to demonstrate who they will accept as governance of the Gaza Strip.”When asked by Tapper whether Palestinian people would be better off with a group other than Hamas, the foreign minister said it would be up to the Palestinian people to decide.Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.The exact circumstances and dates of the detentions are unclear, but some of the detainees’ identities were confirmed by colleagues or family members.At least some of the men are civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a conversation CNN had with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor posted an image of one detainment and said in a statement on its website Thursday that “the Israeli army detained and severely abused dozens of Palestinian civilians.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on the images. CNN has geo-located some of the images to Beit Lahia, north of Gaza City.The Israeli media, without indicating a source, has portrayed the images as the surrender of Hamas members.“We investigate and check who has ties to Hamas, and who does not,” he said. “We arrest them all and question them. We will continue dismantling each one of those strongholds until we are done.”In a statement Thursday, news outlet The New Arab, or Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, said one of its correspondents and several members of his family were among those detained as part of the incident portrayed in the images.“Today, Thursday, the Israeli occupation army arrested the journalist and the director of ‘The New Arab’ office in Gaza, our colleague Diaa Al-Kahlot, from Market Street in Beit Lahia, along with a group of his brothers, relatives, and other civilians,” Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote.“The occupation deliberately forced Gazans to take off their clothes, searched them, and humiliated them when they were arrested before taking them to an unknown destination, according to what the people there told us,” he said.Hussam Kanafani, the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed editor-in-chief, said in the statement that Al-Kahlot and his family were still missing.“We will make every effort possible, in cooperation with international institutions and organizations concerned with the rights and freedom of journalists in the world, to determine the whereabouts of our colleague Diaa and release him as soon as possible,” Kanafani said.CNN spoke with a relative of another detained men, Hani al-Madhoun, from his home in the United States.“Israeli forces arrived on the street and called out all the men to come out, and they complied,” al-Madhoun told CNN. “This house was their place of refuge after our two homes were destroyed.”Al-Madhoun said he was in contact with his sister, who is in Gaza.He said he recognized his cousin Aboud in one of the photographs and saw his brother Mahmood in a video. He said that Mahmoud is a shopkeeper and Aboud “is not involved in any activities; he helps his father in construction.”US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday described how US pressure has resulted in incremental progress from Israel in protecting civilians and allowing aid into Gaza.Blinken noted that after each of his trips to Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government shifted toward the US position.The top US diplomat noted that on his first trip to Israel, in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 Hamas attack, “we made the case for the imperative of getting” aid into Gaza.“After we left, that assistance started to flow,” he said at a news conference at the State Department alongside UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron.He said on his second trip, the focus was on emphasizing how “humanitarian pauses could be beneficial in getting hostages out, getting more assistance in.”“Well, shortly after we left that’s also what happened,” he said.On his most recent trip to Israel last week, Blinken stressed the need to protect civilians and pressed the Israeli government not to carry out its offensive in south Gaza in the same way it did in the north. He also stressed the need for sustained humanitarian assistance.“What we’ve seen over the initial days is some important additional steps in the direction of doing just that,” Blinken said.Still, the top US diplomat reiterated that there remains a gap between the “intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground.”Israel says it will open the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza for the inspection of aid trucks in the “next few days” as the United Nation’s aid chief hailed the “promising signs” pointing toward this development.Col. Elad Goren made the announcement during a news briefing Thursday organized by Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, more commonly known as COGAT.He did not specify whether the trucks will be allowed to travel to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing itself after the inspection or whether they will need to travel through the Rafah crossing in Egypt, which is already being used to facilitate aid deliveries.“We will open Kerem Shalom just for inspection. It will happen in the next few days,” Goren said.Goren, who is head of the Civil Department at COGAT, said it would be essential to open the crossing if Israel wanted to inspect more than 200 trucks a day bound for Gaza.A few hours later, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths told a briefing in Geneva that there are “promising signs” indicating that the much-debated crossing would “be able to open soon.”Griffiths also did not provide any details regarding what role exactly the crossing would perform if opened.The UN has been calling for several weeks for the crossing to be opened, saying it would facilitate deliveries of more vital humanitarian aid to Gaza.US President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday to discuss the latest developments in the war between Israel and Hamas.During the conversation, Biden reiterated the need for Israel to protect civilians, according to a readout of the call from the White House.Biden also told Netanyahu that more aid was “urgently required across the board,” according to the statement.The president additionally relayed “deep concern” for hostages still being held in Gaza, telling Netanyahu that Hamas’ refusal to release young women civilian hostages is to blame for the breakdown in the humanitarian pause last week.Israeli and US officials believe Hamas continues to hold hostage a number of women between the approximate ages of 20 to 30 – many of them kidnapped from the Nova music festival – CNN previously reported. Hamas insisted that some of the remaining women they were holding hostage were considered part of the Israel Defense Forces, which Israel denied.More on the leaders’ calls: Per CNN’s count, it’s the 16th call between the two leaders since October 7, and the first since November 26.On Wednesday, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby was asked in the White House news briefing why the two had not spoken since November, Kirby said he “wouldn’t read anything into that.”“I just wouldn’t read anything into the fact that there hasn’t been a conversation in recent days. There absolutely will be additional conversations between the two. I have no doubt about that,” Kirby told reporters.The Israel Defense Forces on Thursday released a satellite image and video it said showed Hamas rocket launches next to a “humanitarian zone” and United Nations facility in southern Gaza.Because the IDF satellite image of the rocket location is cropped, and the video is cropped and low resolution, it is not possible for CNN to corroborate its location.“Hamas is the enemy of humanity and makes itself a threat to the entire world,” the IDF said on X, formerly known as Twitter.Some context: Along with the allegation, the IDF released a map showing the “Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone,” encompassing a large swath of southwestern Gaza. But in a post on X with the same allegation, the IDF posted a map showing a far smaller humanitarian zone, encompassing just a small neighborhood near the UN facility. And in a post on X earlier this week, the IDF’s Arabic language spokesperson referenced the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone without any map indicating its boundaries.The Palestinian Authority should be granted the ability to govern both Gaza and the West Bank — but it is still too early to discuss any details, Egypt’s foreign minister said Thursday.Sameh Shoukry said that it is “a matter that should be addressed by the Palestinian people,” and Egypt believes the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization are the “legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people.”Shoukry, speaking at an event in Washington, DC, hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that it is still early and premature to decide what will happen in Gaza since the conflict between Israel and Hamas is still ongoing.His comments come ahead of a Friday meeting between top diplomats from Arab states and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, DC.The foreign minister’s comments echo remarks by US President Joe Biden, who said last month that the Palestinian Authority should govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank following the war.In stark contrast, on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Palestinian Authority assuming power in Gaza won’t happen for as long as he is prime minister.“Whoever educates their children for terror, funds terror and supports families of terrorists, could not control Gaza after we eradicate Hamas,” Netanyahu wrote on social media.Some background: The Palestinian Authority is a government body with limited self-rule in the West Bank. It was established in the 1993 Oslo Accords, a peace pact between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization that saw the PLO give up armed resistance against Israel in return for promises of an independent Palestinian state. It has recognized Israel and engaged in multiple failed peace initiatives with it. Hamas controls Gaza and presents itself as an alternative to the PA.CNN’s Catherine Nicholls and journalist Tamar Michaelis contributed reporting to this post.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it is striking targets in Syria and Lebanon after missiles were reportedly launched toward Israel from those countries on Thursday evening.Two missiles launched from Syria landed in an open area in the town of Buq’ata in northern Israel, according to the IDF.The IDF also said it identified “a number of launches” from Lebanon toward the areas of Shtula, Malkia and Zar’it also in the northern part of the country. The launches led to sirens sounding in Golan Heights and Zar’it.The IDF said it is striking the sources of the launches.Earlier on Thursday, the IDF said that Israel Air Force fighter jets struck an “operational command and control center” in Lebanon belonging to Hezbollah after launches were detected coming from the vicinity.The World Health Organization (WHO) managed to deliver supplies to two hospitals in southern Gaza that have not received any deliveries since November 29, according to the organization’s director general.“Today WHO delivered trauma and emergency care supplies to European Gaza Hospital and Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza to cover the needs of 4500 patients,” WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on social media platform X.The WHO chief highlighted the detrimental impact of the “intense fighting” in southern Gaza, saying the fighting has made it “increasingly difficult to run any health operations” there.Since Tuesday, the Israel Defence Forces have been engaged in “intense battles” with Hamas fighters in Khan Younis city in southern Gaza.Video obtained by news agency Reuters on Thursday showed a slew of injured Palestinians rushing into the Nasser Hospital in the city following a barrage of Israeli strikes.Ghebreyesus reiterated that his organization remains “extremely concerned” about the thousands of “patients, and health and care workers” in Gaza, stressing that the only way to protect them is by immediately implementing a ceasefire.An overnight Israeli airstrike killed 18 family members of Dr. Munir Al-Bursh, director-general of the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza, the ministry said Thursday.Several of the bodies arrived at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza as Al-Bursh was on shift there Thursday morning, according to the health ministry.Al-Bursh told CNN his 1-week granddaughter was among those killed.Video from the hospital shows Al-Bursh kneeling on the ground before bodies wrapped in sheets. At least five covered bodies can be seen in the video.Al-Bursh uncovers the face of one of the deceased, an adult male, and touches his face, the video shows.He said the man is his nephew, a university professor with a law degree, days shy of obtaining a doctorate in international law, who “everyone knows for his kindness.”He said his father is the Undersecretary of the Hamas-run Ministry of Justice in Gaza.At least 634 people crossed into Egypt on Thursday through the Rafah border crossing, officials said, including more than 400 dual nationals.This is a breakdown of who exited Gaza into Egypt on Thursday, according to the Rafah Crossing Authority:It added that a total of 70 aid trucks have entered Gaza, including a load of 79,000 liters (nearly 21,000 gallons) of fuel.There are “promising signs” that the Kerem Shalom crossing linking Israel to Gaza may be opened for humanitarian deliveries, according to UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths.“We’re still negotiating,” he said, adding that the crossing has been a “feature of discussion these many weeks.”“There are some promising signs now that that may be able to open soon,” he added.What is Kerem Shalom: Before the war that started in early October, Israel had two crossings with Gaza: Erez, which is for the movement of people, and Kerem Shalom, for goods. Both were heavily restricted and have been shut since the war began. During the brief truce between Israel and Hamas, the Kerem Shalom crossing was used to transfer Israeli hostages from Gaza to Israel.During the two-month conflict, the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt has been the strip’s only entry point to the outside world. Aid to Gaza has trickled through this crossing. It is the only Gazan border crossing that isn’t controlled by Israel.Take a look at where the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings are located:Israeli forces in recent days have arrested and questioned hundreds of suspects in Gaza allegedly involved in terror activities, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said on Thursday.He also said that Israeli forces are “advancing the fighting” in Hamas strongholds in the southern and northern Gaza Strip.On the Israel-Lebanon border: Following the death of an Israeli civilian in northern Israel from an anti-tank missile from Lebanon, Israeli fighter jets struck “a series of terror targets” of Hezbollah on Thursday — in which several operatives of the militant group were killed, he claimed.Israeli military is on a “high alert” in the country’s border with Lebanon and “will severely respond to any terrorists act against Israel,” Hagari said.The United Nations aid chief has said that the organization’s operation in southern Gaza is unable to function properly.“Our humanitarian program is no longer a functioning one. It is one of response to opportunity,” UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths stressed Thursday.Meanwhile, the pace of the Israeli military operation is a direct “repeat of the assault in northern Gaza,” Griffiths said.Since Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces has been operating in the southern city of Khan Younis, engaged in “intense battles” with Hamas fighters. Video obtained by the Reuters news agency Thursday showed a slew of injured Palestinians rushing into the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis following a barrage of Israeli strikes.“None of us can see where this will end. None of us can see where the people crammed into that southern pocket of Gaza will go — those 2 million people,” Griffiths said.The Israeli prime minister said Wednesday that Israeli forces had surrounded the house of Yahya Sinwar, potentially closing in on the top Hamas official in Gaza – and the man most wanted by Israeli authorities.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sinwar was not in the house and was believed to be hiding underground in Gaza, but a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that it was “only a matter of time before we get him.”Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ terror attack against Israel on October 7 — though experts say he is likely one of several — making him one of the key targets of its war in Gaza.A longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas’ military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group’s civilian and political leader.He was elected to Hamas’ main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in the Gaza branch. However, he has since become the Politburo’s de facto leader, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).He has been designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State since 2015 and has been recently sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France.Early days: Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. His family was displaced from a Palestinian village during the Arab-Israeli war.He joined Hamas in the late 1980s and became one of the founders of its feared internal intelligence apparatus, known as the Majd.He was convicted in 1988 of playing a role in the murder of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians suspected of collaboration with Israel, and spent more than two decades in Israeli prison.Sinwar later said he had spent those years studying his enemy, including learning to speak Hebrew.Back in Gaza, Sinwar has risen through the ranks and quickly became a key player within Hamas. He became known for his brutality and the violence he inflicts on anyone he suspects of betrayal or collaboration, said Harel Chorev, senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University.Learn more about Sinwar and why Israel calls him a “dead man walking.”King Abdullah II of Jordan called for an “immediate ceasefire” and emphasized the need to protect civilians in Gaza in a phone call with US President Joe Biden on Thursday, the Royal Hashemite Court said in a statement.King Abdullah II also expressed deep concern that the humanitarian situation could worsen significantly if military operations persist, the statement said. The conversation also delved into ensuring the swift delivery of humanitarian and relief aid to Gaza.The leaders discussed the importance of coordination to bring an end to the ongoing war and establish lasting peace, according to the statement.The king also reaffirmed Jordan’s rejection of any attempts to forcibly displace Palestinians within or outside Gaza, and opposed any endeavors to reoccupy parts of the strip.Investigations by two news organizations and two human rights groups made public on Thursday say that Israeli tank shells killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and injured six other journalists in southern Lebanon in October.The reports by Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch drew on forensic analysis, witness testimony and interviews with government officials, lawyers and medical professionals.The findings are in line with a CNN analysis of the events conducted at the time. A CNN team that was nearby in southern Lebanon reported at the time that the projectile that hit the journalists on October 13 came from Israel.CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the allegations.Eylon Levy, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, said Thursday that he was “not familiar” with the new reports.IDF spokesperson Richard Hecht on October 14 called Abdallah’s death “a tragic thing” without naming him directly or acknowledging Israel’s involvement. The same day, the IDF said, “A report was received that during the incident, journalists were injured in the area. The incident is under review.”AFP and HRW claim in their reports that the strike was a “deliberate,” targeted attack by Israel on the journalists. In a statement to Reuters, Hecht said, “We don’t target journalists.” He did not provide further comment, the news agency reported.Abdallah, 37, was killed and six other reporters were wounded while filming the Israeli border from southern Lebanon. AFP photographer Christina Assi had her leg amputated and remains in the hospital, according to AFP.After analysis of weapon fragments found at the scene, the reports say the journalists were killed and wounded by a 120mm tank round of Israeli origin “that is not used by any other groups in the region.”According to official statements and CNN’s video analysis and geolocation of the incident, at least six other journalists from AFP, Reuters and Al Jazeera all wearing body armor clearly labeled as “press” were injured in the blast.Amnesty International’s investigation did not find “any indication that there were any fighters or military objectives at the site of the strikes.”What the United States is saying: The Pentagon continues to urge Israel to protect innocent civilians, including members of the press, but it has not conducted its own assessment of the death of the Reuters journalist.Singh said the protection of civilians and the need to uphold the laws of armed conflict have repeatedly come up in both public and private conversations with Israeli officials.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the incident should be investigated. The top US diplomat said it was his understanding that Israel has begun such an investigation, and stressed the importance of seeing it through.CNN’s Oren Liebermann and Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting to this post.This post has been updated with the latest comments from the Pentagon and Antony Blinken.The US has now resumed drone flights over Gaza in support of Israel’s hostage recovery efforts, a Pentagon spokesperson said, after pausing them last month as part of a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas.Israel and the US had been flying surveillance drones over Gaza for weeks before the temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.The British government announced on Saturday that it will also begin conducting surveillance flights over the eastern Mediterranean and Gaza to help locate the hostages, which include British nationals.“Surveillance aircraft will be unarmed, do not have a combat role, and will be tasked solely to locate hostages,” the UK statement said, adding that “only information relating to hostage rescue will be passed to the relevant authorities responsible for hostage rescue.”Israel Defense Forces said Friday that there are 136 hostages still being held in Gaza, including 17 women and children.Two senior Hamas members were killed “a few days ago” in an Israeli attack in Gaza, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed in a statement Thursday.Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who IDF says is a senior operative from Hamas’ military intelligence unit, along with another senior member Ahmed Aiush were killed in an attack at Hamas’ central intelligence command center, the military said.CNN is reaching out to Hamas about the Israeli military claim.The IDF didn’t specify the location in Gaza where the two Hamas members were killed.Israel believes it is having some success removing senior Hamas military operatives, which a senior IDF official discussed with journalists about two weeks ago.The official said that Israel assessed Hamas’s military wing was made up of 24 battalions — 10 of which had been “hurt significantly” by Israeli strikes since October 7.Some battalions in the north of the Gaza Strip had lost more than four of their commanders, the official said, representing a loss to those battalions of more than half their senior command.Among other things, this made it harder for Hamas’ military leadership to issue orders for counterattacks, the official said, because there was increasingly no one available to direct operations.Replacing commanders in the middle of a war was not possible, the official added.CNN’s Andrew Carey contributed reporting to this post.The Lebanon National News Agency (NNA) alleged Thursday that Israeli artillery shelled the outskirts of the town of Rmeish, in southern Lebanon, with “phosphorus.”The town is in the far south, close to the Israeli border.Video obtained by CNN shows columns of white smoke above the outskirts of the hilltop town. CNN is unable to confirm the use of phosphorous munitions.CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment.What is white phosphorus? It’s an incendiary weapon used to set fire to military targets. Its use is restricted under international humanitarian law; it can’t be fired at or near civilian areas or civilian infrastructure.Some context: Last month, the IDF responded to accusations about the use of white phosphorus in Lebanon, dismissing reports that the substance had been used for setting fires but acknowledging that it does use it in some circumstances.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Thursday morning with Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, commending the Israeli security cabinet for agreeing to allow more fuel into Gaza but saying that more needs to be done to get humanitarian assistance into the war-torn strip, according to a senior State Department official.Blinken also told Dermer that the Israeli government must do more to protect civilians, the official said.Israel’s security cabinet on Wednesday approved a “minimal” increase in the amount of fuel entering Gaza.In an interview on CNN’s “King Charles” on Wednesday, Blinken said that Israeli is taking some “important steps” to better protect civilians, but more action is required.Gal Meir Eisenkot, son of Israeli government minister Gadi Eisenkot, has been killed in northern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces announced on Thursday.“Master sergeant (Res.) Gal Meir Eisenkot, 25 from Herlizya, combat soldier in the 699th Battalion of the 551st reserve commando Brigade, died in battle in the northern Gaza Strip,” the IDF said in a statement.His father was chief of the General Staff of the IDF from February 2015 to January 2019 and served in the military for four decades.In the wake of the October 7 attacks, he joined the wartime cabinet as a minister without portfolio. He is a member of Benny Gantz’s National Unity Party, and was elected to Knesset in 2022.A total of 88 IDF soldiers have been killed in Gaza since October 7.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences in a post on X, formerly Twitter.“The government of Israel and the citizens of Israel mourn together with you. Our heroes did not fall in vain. We will continue to fight until victory,” Netanyahu said.Israel war cabinet member and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz also paid his tribute, saying in a statement: “May the memory of Gal and the memory of all those who fell in the battle for the home of all of us be blessed. Also in his name, also in their name, we continue the mission.”Correction: This post has been updated to reflect Gal Meir Eisenkot’s rank is master sergeant, not first sergeant. It also was updated to reflect that his father served as chief of the General Staff of the IDF until January 2019.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited northern Israel on Thursday, where he gave a blunt warning to Hezbollah.His warning comes after an Israeli man was killed by an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon on Thursday, according to Israeli first responders MDA. The Israeli military said an anti-tank missile was fired from Lebanese territory toward the area of Mattat in northern Israel.Israel and Hezbollah — an Iran-backed armed group that dominates southern Lebanon — have been engaged in daily cross-border exchanges of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border after the start of the conflict between Israel and Hamas on October 7, raising fears that the fighting could escalate into a regional war.Israel has received 200 cargo planes of military equipment from several countries, according to Israeli Ministry of Defense.This comes as use of US weapons come under scrutiny.The planes carried military equipment, including ammunition, armored vehicles and weapons, according to the Israeli Ministry of Defense, as the use of US weapons in the ongoing war in Gaza comes under increased scrutiny.The US State Department and the Defense Department both said they are reviewing Amnesty International’s report.The Israeli ministry said more than 10,000 tons of military equipment have been delivered since the start of the war on October 7. Pictures released by the Israeli Ministry of Defense show two different types of armored vehicles, as well as pallets of supplies.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense said the aid had come from several countries, but declined to say what other countries had sent aid or how much of it had come from the United States. The shipments of US military aid began soon after the war began.On Wednesday, December 6, for the first time, the number of corpses arriving at Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza surpassed the number of injured, Doctors Without Borders reported.The Al-Aqsa hospital is supported by Doctors Without Borders, according to the organization, which is also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).MSF reported 115 people killed in 24 hours.“The hospital is full, the morgue is full,” it said on X, the social media platform formerly called Twitter.The Israel Defense Forces has released a photo of a group of senior Hamas officials it claims to have killed in its military operation in Gaza.The photo shows 11 men from the Northern Gaza Brigade — the second largest unit in Hamas, according to the IDF, seated around a table, five of which have been circled in red and labeled as “eliminated.”The men indicated to have been killed are:In a statement, the IDF said the fighters were killed in an attack on a Hamas tunnel where they were “hiding under civilian homes and close to the Indonesian hospital.”According to the IDF, Al-Ghandour was “head of the military formation and responsible for the observations in the north of the Gaza Strip.”The brigade was hard hit in the attack, according to the IDF, and its functioning has been significantly compromised due to damage to its command center and infrastructure in the tunnels below Gaza.The IDF also claims to have killed four battalion commanders in the Gaza Brigade who are not pictured, destroying its battalion headquarters and infrastructure as well as taking control of central Gaza strongholds.CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment.The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said that work has stopped at its ambulance center in the northern Gaza governorate, because there is no fuel for vehicles and hospitals are out of service.In a statement issued Thursday, the PRCS said that minor and moderate injuries were being handled at a medical point set up by the PRCS’ ambulance team in the area.It said that the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza faced “very great challenges” in treating the wounded, again accusing the Israel military of targeting the hospital.Work in all hospitals in Gaza City, especially Al-Quds and Al-Shifa hospitals, had stopped because the Israeli military prevented crews from providing services, and many workers had been forced to flee to the south, “creating hundreds of victims due to the impossibility of providing emergency and medical service to the injured.”The Israel Defense Forces has persistently denied targeting hospitals as such, but accuses Hamas of operating from within and under hospitals. Israel says it will strike Hamas wherever it sees the militant group.On Wednesday, the PRCS said it was stopping its ambulance operations in northern Gaza.In southern Gaza, the PRCS said the fuel crisis continued at the Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis governorate, “where the consumption of services provided has been reduced to minimum.”Recovery efforts: The PRCS also said that bodies continue to be retrieved from the streets and from under rubble but operations to recover the dead were difficult because of the lack of fuel.It estimated the number of those unaccounted for — either under the rubble or lying in the streets — at 7,500, of which more than 4,700 are children and women.The PRCS said that 286 medical staff had been killed in Gaza since October 7 and 56 ambulances destroyed.CNN is unable to verify the society’s figures, but ambulances have been unable to operate in parts of northern Gaza because of air strikes and impassable roads. Anecdotal evidence suggests many bodies have not been recovered from destroyed buildings.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron has told CNN that Israel should “behave differently” in the south of Gaza than it has in the north, as its military campaign in the embattled enclave spreads.Cameron, a former British Prime Minister, reiterated British support for Israel in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attacks, but urged the country to abide by international law in its response.“We have to give Israel that basic support of saying, ‘You are right to try to get rid of Hamas’ leadership and its armed personnel’,” Cameron told CNN during a trip to Washington, D.C.He resisted calls for an immediate ceasefire, saying: “If we leave Hamas in charge of even a part of Gaza, there will never be a two-state solution because you can’t expect Israel to live next to a group of people that want to do October 7 all over again.”But Cameron supported remarks by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who told CNN on Wednesday that Israel is taking some “important steps” to better protect civilians during its offensive in southern Gaza.A humanitarian crisis has unfolded in Gaza, where Israeli air and ground assaults have left Palestinians displaced and in dire need of food, supplies and medical care.Cameron said that Blinken, whom he will meet on Thursday, made “a series of points about how Israel is trying to behave differently in the south of Gaza to the north of Gaza, and I think that is right, and we should continue to make those points to them.”“Ultimately the long-term security of Israel does depend not only on their own armed strength and fortitude, but also on having Palestinians able to live in peace and security as well,” Cameron said.More than 16,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since October 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah, which compiles its reports with data from hospitals in Hamas-run Gaza.In northern Gaza, 97% of households have inadequate food consumption and approximately 83% in southern Gaza are “adopting extreme consumption strategies” to survive as the Israel-Hamas war has caused “unimaginable loss, destruction and misery” in the strip, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said Thursday“Everyone in Gaza is hungry,” WFP chief Cindy McCain warned on social media platform X, formerly called Twitter. She also reiterated support for the UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire.In a report, the WFP said 9 out of 10 people in northern Gaza are going a full day and night without food consistently. CNN has reported on starving residents in Gaza digging for food, supplies under the rubble.The report also made the following assessment:The WFP said it was able to conduct a rapid food security assessment using a remote survey during the truce which ended on December 1. After this period, the situation has deteriorated further.The US is considering beefing up protections for commercial ships around a vital Red Sea shipping route amid a series of recent missile attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militants operating out of Yemen, according to military officials.The US has discussed ways to increase security in the area with members of the Combined Maritime Forces, a multi-national naval task force charged with protecting commercial shipping in the Red Sea. US officials have said publicly that discussions have centered on the possibility of escorting ships operating in the Red Sea and through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait into the Gulf of Aden — the narrow channel that separates Yemen and the Horn of Africa.Seven members of the task force — made up of 39 nations that rotate command — have already offered to help, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told an audience at the Atlantic Council in Washington on Monday. US officials have declined to say which nations have stepped forward.The discussions about bolstering the task force reflect growing concern in the region over the Iran-backed Houthis’ interference with the vital channel, through which millions of barrels of oil passes daily.The Houthi rebels, who are funded and trained by Iran, have repeatedly attacked commercial ships with drones and missiles in recent weeks, and in November seized an Israeli-linked cargo ship, taking its crew hostage. They have also launched missiles toward Israel, one of which was intercepted by a US Navy destroyer in October.Sanctions: The US Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on 13 individuals and entities with ties to a network providing tens of millions of dollars to the Houthis.Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement that “the Houthis continue to receive funding and support from Iran, and the result is unsurprising: unprovoked attacks on civilian infrastructure and commercial shipping, disrupting maritime security and threatening international commercial trade.”“Treasury will continue to disrupt the financial facilitation and procurement networks that enable these destabilizing activities,” he said.CNN’s Haley Britzky and Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting to this post.Clashes and Israeli strikes are continuing in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, according to reports on Thursday. Meanwhile, video geolocated by CNN shows heavy gunfire at the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza.It comes as the Rafah border crossing is set to open today for dozens of foreign nationals and dual citizens to exit the war-torn Strip, according to Egyptian authorities.Here are some of the other developments:This post has been updated with new reporting on the death toll in Gaza.Several students were wounded after an Israeli airstrike hit the town of Kounine in south Lebanon, the Lebanese national news agency (NNA) reported Thursday. NNA said students at the Kounine Institute were injured by shattered glass.Kounine sits several kilometres away from the country’s border with Israel.Video obtained by CNN shows the aftermath of the strike, with thick black smoke billowing above the town, with people running to safety on the streets.CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the incident.Hezbollah also said they targeted the Israeli kibbutz of Ma’yan Baruch on Thursday morning, which sits close to the border with Lebanon, to “support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in support of their brave and honorable resistance.”Hezbollah also claimed on Thursday to target another town that borders south Lebanon.Protesters in the United Kingdom have blocked entrances at four weapon factories that provide Israel with weapons and supplies, activist group Workers for a Free Palestine said on social media Thursday.Dozens of demonstrators with Palestinian flags are staging the blockades at the BAE Systems factory in Glasgow, the L3Harris factory in Brighton and at sites in Bournemouth and Lancashire.They are also calling for the British government to back a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.The UK is a key supplier for Israel’s military, providing 15% of the components for Israel’s F-35 fighter jets, according to a reported published by UK-based organization Campaign Against Arm Trade (CAAT) on October 17.The total value of these contracts is estimated to be $422 million (£336 million) since 2016, according to CAAT.Video geolocated by CNN shows heavy gunfire at the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza on Thursday.The footage shows civilians running in the street as the gunfire echoes through the area.Other video also geolocated by CNN shows damage to the nearby Al-Yemeni Saeed hospital, where the walls appear to have been impacted by shelling. It’s unclear when the damage was sustained.Accurate information about the strikes and clashes in Gaza, as well as about casualties and the state of hospitals, is difficult to obtain because of sporadic communications.However, a journalist in northern Gaza, Khader Al Za’anoun, told CNN that Israeli airstrikes had destroyed the Othman bin Qushqar mosque in the Zaytoun neighborhood of Gaza City. There were also injuries in nearby houses, Za’anoun said.He added that the Israeli army was deploying tanks in Palestine Square in Gaza City.Al-Za’anoun said there had been heavy casualties in several neighborhoods on northern Gaza, including in Shuja’iya, Zaytoun and Al-Daraj, and it was difficult for ambulances to reach the affected areas because of the gunfire.CNN is reaching out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on ongoing operations and deployments in northern Gaza and the claims that the Othman bin Qushqar Mosque has been destroyed.Elsewhere, there are reports of clashes and Israeli strikes continuing in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, where the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that the military had encircled the house of the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.The IDF posted video Thursday of troops moving through buildings geolocated by CNN as in the north of Khan Younis.At least 94 people have died and 406 been injured in Lebanon as a result of “the Israeli aggression against southern Lebanon” between October 8 – when Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel – and December 5, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.In a report released on Wednesday, the ministry added that 92% of wounded people are males and 96% of wounded people are Lebanese,The Israeli military has regularly exchanged fire with militants in southern Lebanon over the past two months, saying when it is fired upon, it will return fire.The Lebanon Disaster Risk Management Unit as of Wednesday had registered 20,000 displaced people from villages in Tyre district, south Lebanon, Lebanon state-run NNA news said on Thursday.Those displaced people are distributed among five shelter centers in the city of Tyre, not including thousands who were displaced to other areas and were not registered within the Disaster Risk Management Unit, NNA added.The unit said that there is a lack of resources to provide services, saying nearly 40 villages on the border with Israel are still not safe for civilians to return.Israel has also evacuated communities on its side of the border in response to rockets fired from Lebanese territory.Eight Thai nationals are now believed to be held hostage by Hamas, according to Thailand’s foreign affairs ministry.That figure is one less than previously reported after it was discovered that one person was safely in Israel the whole time.Twenty-three Thai nationals held hostage in Gaza were released by Hamas under a deal brokered with Israel with the help of foreign mediation. The agreement saw a pause in fighting and the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza will open Thursday for dozens of foreign nationals and dual citizens to exit the war-torn strip, according to Egyptian authorities.A list published by the Egyptian Authority for Crossings and Borders includes 63 US citizens alongside nationals of Romania, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.It also includes 13 United Nations personnel intending to enter Gaza.Rafah is the only border crossing in Gaza not controlled by Israel. It has been a vital lifeline for aid to enter the enclave and for people to escape the fighting since Israel’s war with Hamas began in October.UK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps will visit Israel and the occupied West Bank this week in a push for humanitarian aid to be delivered quicker to war-torn Gaza, the British government said Thursday.In a news release, the government said Shapps will discuss delivering aid by sea directly to the strip during upcoming talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.Four Royal Air Force flights carrying more than 74 metric tons of aid for Palestinians have landed in Egypt, the release added.Shapps is also expected to discuss progress on recovering hostages, including several Britons who were taken by Hamas in the October 7 attack.Two Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday amid Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza, the Israeli military said.One of the men was killed in battle in central Gaza, while the other died a day after he was wounded in southern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.Four other Israeli soldiers were seriously injured in Gaza on Wednesday, the IDF said.Dozens of Israeli troops have been killed since Israel expanded its ground operations in the Palestinian enclave in October. More than 16,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in the strip since October 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.Multiple United Nations agencies are warning of the dire situation for residents of war-torn Gaza as Israel approved a “minimal” increase in the amount of fuel permitted to enter the strip to prevent a “humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics” in the south.In separate statements Wednesday, the World Health Organization chief said Gaza’s health system is “on its knees” and nearing total collapse, while the head of the World Food Programme said the humanitarian system in the strip is collapsing and, “Everyone in #Gaza is hungry.”Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it is advancing in the south of the enclave, where it says it has surrounded the home of Hamas’ leader in Gaza in what a senior adviser to Israel’s prime minister told CNN was a “symbolic victory.”Here’s what else you need to know:Gaza’s health system is “on its knees” and nearing total collapse, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement on Wednesday.On Tuesday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah accused the Israeli military of placing the Kamal Adwan hospital under siege.CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for a response. In previous statements, Israel had maintained it targets Hamas infrastructure in the strip.WHO has reported at least 212 attacks on Gaza’s health sector since October 7. As a result, only 14 hospitals are partially functioning and three are minimally functioning in the strip, while 19 have gone out of service, the WHO chief added.Palestinian Minister of Health Mai Al-Kaila said Tuesday that none of the hospitals in northern Gaza can accommodate surgical operations, while the capacity has surpassed 216% in hospitals in the south.CNN’s Kareem Khadder contributed reporting to this post.An investigation by Amnesty International alleges that a US-made weapons guidance system was used in two Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in October in which 43 civilians are said to have been killed.Fragments of the US-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions guidance system were found in the rubble of destroyed homes in the neighborhood of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to a report released Tuesday by the human rights organization.Israel uses a wide variety of American weapons and munitions, but Amnesty’s report is one of the first attempts to tie an American-made weapon to a specific attack that left a significant number of civilians dead.The JDAM is a “guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into accurate, adverse weather ‘smart’ munitions,” according to the US Air Force.CNN cannot independently verify Amnesty’s findings.Amnesty said its weapons experts and a “remote sensing analyst” examined satellite imagery and photos of the homes that show the “fragments of ordnance recovered from the rubble” and the destruction, the report explains. Amnesty’s fieldworkers took the photos.As a result of these two attacks, 19 children, 14 women, and 10 men were killed, the report claims.The human rights organization said it “did not find any indication there were any military objectives at the sites” of the airstrikes or that the individuals living in the homes were legitimate military targets.In a statement to CNN, the Israel Defense Forces called the report “flawed, biased and premature, based on baseless assumptions regarding the IDF’s operations.”Read more about the Amnesty report.World Food Programme (WFP) Chief Cindy McCain is warning of the limited access to food and water in the Gaza strip.WFP said 97% of Palestinian households in the northern areas of the strip and 83% in the south reported inadequate food consumption — with many having spent at least one day without eating.The lack of cooking gas in Gaza has also led many to rely on waste burning, firewood and wood rubbish, which can have negative health repercussions, including high risks of respiratory diseases, according to WFP’s data.Additionally, the average daily clean water consumption levels range between 1.5-1.8 liters per person across the strip, which is way below the 15 liters minimum average volume of water for drinking and hygiene per person daily.The number of civilian casualties in Gaza is too high, US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Wednesday.Speaking several days into the renewed offensive by Israeli forces in southern Gaza, Miller said the United States wants “to see the civilian death toll lower than it has been.”Miller noted the conflict in southern Gaza was “still at an early stage,” and would not say whether the US believes Israeli forces are carrying out this part of their offensive differently than in the north.Miller said the State Department had “some very frank conversations with the government of Israel about that when we were there last week,” during US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit.“We continue to have very frank discussions with them about this question, and I think I’ll leave it at that,” he said.Blinken said last week that Israel must prosecute the war differently in the south than it did in the north.Israeli forces have breached Hamas “defense lines” in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where they have been involved in a fierce battle with the militant group since Tuesday, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said Wednesday.It comes after the IDF said the Israeli military had begun carrying out raids against “Hamas strongholds” in the center of Khan Younis, the territory’s second-largest city.Within a few hours after Israeli troops surrounded the city, “the soldiers pierced through the defensive lines of the Khan Younis Brigade, encircling it and for the first time began to operate in the heart of the area,” the military said.The Khan Younis Brigade is one of Hamas’ two most significant battalions, according to the Israeli military.Hamas leader “underground”: Earlier Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces had encircled the house of Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. The IDF would not say where it believes Sinwar is, but that he was “underground.” Sinwar is originally from Khan Younis but it is unclear if he is currently there.Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is “underground” in Gaza, the Israeli military said Wednesday, but did not say where they believe he is.The statement from an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson came shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the IDF had surrounded Sinwar’s house in southern Gaza.“Our role is to reach Sinwar and kill him. We need to do that as soon as possible,” he added.A senior adviser to Netanyahu on Wednesday told CNN the encirclement of Sinwar’s house is a “symbolic victory.”“It will be a real victory very soon,” Mark Regev said. “It’s only a matter of time before we get the man.”A partisan clash between Senate Republicans and Democrats over border policy continues to threaten the effort to send badly needed foreign aid to key US allies as time and money are running out for Ukraine.Senate negotiators are vowing to continue to try to reach a deal, after Republicans blocked foreign aid from advancing Wednesday evening in protest over the package’s lack of changes to border and immigration policy.The impasse among negotiators has taken on a renewed sense of urgency as the 2023 congressional calendar is drawing to a close.The Senate has struggled for weeks as it tied immigration and border security policy — one of Congress’ historically most divisive issues — to a legislative package for sending aid to key US allies, among them Israel and Ukraine.Read the full

CNN,Images from Gaza show Israeli soldiers detaining dozens of men stripped to underwear,2023-12-07 21:28:00,Abeer Salman,"Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.The exact circumstances and dates of the detentions are unclear, but some of the detainees’ identities were confirmed by colleagues or family members.At least some of the men are civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a conversation CNN had with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor posted an image of one detainment and said in a statement on its website Thursday that “the Israeli army detained and severely abused dozens of Palestinian civilians.”“Euro-Med Monitor received reports that Israeli forces launched random and arbitrary arrest campaigns against displaced people, including doctors, academics, journalists, and elderly men,” it said.The Israel Defense Forces has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on the images. CNN has geo-located some of the images to Beit Lahia, north of Gaza City.The Israeli media, without indicating a source, has portrayed the images as the surrender of Hamas members. A journalist asked IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari about the images during a news conference on Thursday, saying, “We’ve seen images of many captives, Hamas terrorists, that the IDF arrested during the ground maneuvering.”Hagari said that, in fighting Hamas, “those left in the area gradually come out.”“We investigate and check who has ties to Hamas, and who does not,” he said. “We arrest them all and question them. We will continue dismantling each one of those strongholds until we are done.”In a statement Thursday, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed said that one of its correspondents and several members of his family were among those detained as part of the incident portrayed in the images.“Today, Thursday, the Israeli occupation army arrested the journalist and the director of ‘The New Arab’ office in Gaza, our colleague Diaa Al-Kahlot, from Market Street in Beit Lahia, along with a group of his brothers, relatives, and other civilians,” Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote.“The occupation deliberately forced Gazans to take off their clothes, searched them, and humiliated them when they were arrested before taking them to an unknown destination, according to what the people there told us. Pictures and video clips spread showing soldiers arresting dozens of Gazans using criminal and humiliating method.”Hussam Kanafani, the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed editor-in-chief, said in the statement that Al-Kahlot and his family were still missing.“We will make every effort possible, in cooperation with international institutions and organizations concerned with the rights and freedom of journalists in the world, to determine the whereabouts of our colleague Diaa and release him as soon as possible,” Kanafani said.CNN spoke with a relative of other detained men, Hani al-Madhoun, from his home in the United States.“Israeli forces arrived on the street and called out all the men to come out, and they complied,” al-Madhoun told CNN. “This house was their place of refuge after our two homes were destroyed.”Al-Madhoun said he was in contact with his sister, who is in Gaza.He said that he recognized his cousin Aboud in one of the photographs and saw his brother Mahmood in a video.

ABC,Investment banks to put $10 billion into projects aimed at interconnecting South America,2023-12-07 21:17:00,MAURICIO SAVARESE Associated Press,"SAO PAULO -- Four investment banks announced Thursday during a meeting of leaders of the Mercosur trade bloc that they will put $10 billion up for infrastructure works aimed at better connecting South America, including funds for port, airport, road, rail and power transmission projects.The “Routes for South American Integration” initiative was launched in Rio de Janeiro with host Brazil introducing a plan involving more than 120 projects, many of them in Brazil's north bordering Venezuela, Guyana, French Guyana and Suriname.The funds will come from the Inter-American Development Bank with $3.4 billion, the Development Bank of Latin American and the Caribbean with $3 billion, the Brazilian Development Bank with another $3 billion, and FONPLATA, a bank owned by Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, with $600 million more.Aloizio Mercadante, the president of Brazil's Development Bank, said his institution will finance works “from the border within Brazil” and the other banks will pay for projects “from the border to the outside.”“It is the biggest fund ever built for South American integration and for Mercosur in Mercosur's history,” Mercadante said.Brazil’s Planning and Budget Ministry said in a statement the new infrastructure is aimed at “significantly reducing the time of transportation of merchandise between Brazil and Asia.”Similar plans for South American integration failed in the last three decades, but Brazil’s Planning Minister Simone Tebet says it will be different this time.“The regional integration project is finally mature enough to come true. That has happened after a lot of dialogue and many conversations between leaders,” Tebet said.The integration plan includes five main projects.The Guyana Islands route project will boost infrastructure in Brazil's northern states of Amapa and Roraima to better connect them to Guyana, French Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela.The Manta-Manaus route includes the Brazilian state of Amazonas and parts of the states of Roraima, Para and Amapa in a river link to Colombia, Peru and Ecuador.The Rondon Quadrant route involves the Brazilian states of Acre and Rondonia and the soybean rich portion of the Mato Grosso state to connect it with Bolivia and Peru.The Capricorn rout links the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana and Santa Catarina through multiple pathways to Paraguay, Argentina and Chile.And the Porto Alegre-Coquimbo route boosts connections between the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul to Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.",2525,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/investment-banks-put-10-billion-projects-aimed-interconnecting-105483991,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/60966a9e-0b9b-4c99-b22c-2f21ae8741c4/wirestory_c4b3aef76ba047cb0e1c5ffcba38fad9_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,airport significantly merchandise lot mercadante amazona conversation guyana fonplata porto american planning launch fail involves santa mato amapa port pathway parana reduce power rondonia similar plan road project paulo quadrant happen transmission northern built suriname work argentina rondon aim chile catarina president mercosur institution investment bordering different put minister part decade uruguay river infrastructure multiple america state trade finance finally host acre grande route big mature pay transportation include sao french island fund rio connection history budget meeting initiative rail bloc million announce peru involve north thursday time statement roraima paraguay latin bank bolivia ministry brazil border grosso development link brazilian rich dialogue connect boost capricorn regional south simone portion billion venezuela tebet janeiro colombia rout soybean introduce caribbean leader integration,0.8052,0.0,12.782050113895217,0.3181818181818181,0,2023-12-07
ABC,"Hong Kong's new election law thins the candidate pool, giving voters little option in Sunday's polls",2023-12-07 20:36:00,KANIS LEUNG Associated Press,"HONG KONG -- One of the Hong Kong's longest-serving pro-democracy council members is organizing a farewell party with her residents in late December. Another democratic council member isn't running for reelection to the post that has come to define him in recent years.As more obstacles are placed in front of candidates, the pool is thinning and becoming less politically diverse, leaving mostly “patriots,” those loyal to mainland China, in the running. And with such slim options, some voters say they won’t participate.Sunday’s district council elections will be absent of pro-democracy candidates for the first time in about four decades. Some of them chose to opt out, while others were unable to gather the requisite nominations to qualify — a hurdle that proved difficult to clear even for some pro-government politicians.During her 38-year tenure, Winnie Poon made history as the first popularly elected female council member in Kwun Tong district and witnessed the councils become more democratic. She said she's stepping down because of her age, but also because she's “uninterested in playing this game” anymore, envisioning a future where councilors, who primarily handle municipal matters such as organizing construction projects and public facilities, instead serve to back the city government’s ideas.“After a long journey, I realized, ‘Oh, there’s another starting point,'” she said. “It’s even further back than where I originally started.”Jay Li, one of Hong Kong ’s remaining pro-democracy district councilors, decided not seek reelection this year after the government’s electoral overhaul.At the height of the pro-democracy protests in 2019, Li and his colleagues rode a wave of anti-government sentiment to a landslide victory in the municipal-level elections. Representing residents of Sham Shui Po, one of Hong Kong’s poorest districts, Li's commitment was to improve the community through a bottom-up approach.But for Li, the new election rules raise the cost of running and undermine the legitimacy of elections.An amendment passed in July eliminates most directly elected seats on local district councils, the last major political representative bodies mostly chosen by the public, from some 90% to about 20% — a level even lower than when these bodies were first introduced in the 1980s under British rule. It also requires candidates to secure endorsements from at least nine members of government-appointed committees that are mostly packed with Beijing loyalists, making it virtually impossible for their pro-democracy rivals to run.“It’s going backward. How much effort will it take to get back to where we were?” he said. “My heart is very tired.”The lack of diversity in Hong Kong’s grassroots politics is widely seen as a result of the government’s crackdown on the pro-democracy movement following the 2019 protests — the most concerted challenge to Beijing since the former British colony returned to China’s rule in 1997. China had promised the territory could retain its civil, economic and political liberties for 50 years under the “one country, two systems” framework. But in recent years, the Hong Kong government has severely limited rights to free speech and assembly and virtually eliminated political opposition under the rubric of maintaining national security.The pro-democracy camp’s stunning win in the last elections four years ago was a clear rebuke to the government’s handling of the 2019 protests.Yet Li's party, the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People’s Livelihood, which is famous for its dedication to serving low-income residents, was unable to field any candidates for the first time since its founding in 1986.Kwok Wai-shing, Li’s colleague who intended to run, tried to secure nominations by emailing all local committee members — calling some of them and even contacting multiple members through the networks of his senior colleagues. But the effort failed, with some of them simply saying it was “inconvenient for them to reply,” Kwok said.""The committee members may not solely consider one’s abilities and experience, or whether they love Hong Kong and China,"" he said.Pro-Beijing lawmaker Michael Tien's political group also faced difficulties in securing nominations.In October, Tien told reporters that four members in his group tried to visit about 240 nominators, but 200 of them did not answer the door and 15 others refused to listen to their platform. Only one member of his group obtained sufficient endorsements to run.“When some committee members and chairpersons have political affiliation, this is very unfavorable to other groups like us that do not have many people who are also committee members,"" he told The Associated Press. “There’s no chance to introduce ourselves.""About 70% of the hopefuls running for a seat in the geographical constituencies sit on one of the three committees that are responsible for endorsing candidates, according to a count by the AP.The polls have become “small-circle” elections, said John Burns, an honorary professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong. The exclusion of all but official patriots reflects the government’s preference for obedient councils, Burns said. The new councils would be unlikely to reflect the city's diverse opinions, he said, undermining their crucial role as a bridge connecting the government to the community.“They become official patriots reflecting other official patriots’ opinions,"" he said.But the Home Affairs Department insisted the new nomination rule is reasonable, citing a court dismissal of a judicial review against the requirement on Dec. 1.Judge Russell Coleman ruled that there was insufficient evidence to suggest the pro-democracy camp’s failures to secure enough nominations were due to unfairness in the new rule.The department says the requirement helped ensure the candidates are recognized by those who are familiar with district affairs.Chris Ip, a pro-Beijing politician trying to make a comeback to the council after losing in 2019, said it’s impossible for those who worked in the district for a long period not to know any of the committee members. Ip, who sits on one of the committees, said after the overhaul, candidates put a stronger emphasis on their platforms and councilors are better able to focus on their constituents' livelihoods.Some pro-democracy voters aren't buying it, and plan to turn their backs on the election. When Chow Tak-wing, a supporter of Kwok, learned that Kwok could not join the race, he decided not to vote too.But Hong Kong leader John Lee and other officials are repeatedly appealing to the public to vote, determined to boost the turnout rate. The government planned various promotional activities, including game booths, an outdoor concert and offers of free visits to some museums. Advertisements were posted across subway stations. The city's prominent airline Cathay Pacific Airways also offered discount airfare for passengers traveling back from mainland China to Hong Kong, saying its aim is to help residents “actively participate” in the polls.While the government is working to spotlight the elections, council members like Poon and Li are preparing for their exits under the sharply shifting political landscape.Without council seats, his party would have even fewer resources to sustain its operations, Li said.",7377,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/hong-kongs-new-election-law-thins-candidate-pool-105483453,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/303ba9d4-045b-482c-8d3d-c2c8e67308ca/wirestory_546a33a54ca9a5317e3bd7fa5f17a54b_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country chosen raise spotlight shui dedication affiliation kwok opinion back return insist opt sham win public intend airfare seat promise requirement patriot improve facility suggest major long bridge lose crucial economic severely free requisite popularly body appeal define qualify project tenure strong senior nomination rule leave effort china electoral female aim uninterested hong handle preference offer exclusion system politics eliminates difficult diversity constituent front represent maintain matter slim email start put virtually review overhaul sharply endorse responsible nominator crackdown poorest told decade democratic unable cost level anymore multiple remain learn loyal actively councilors solely poll game rebuke inconvenient travel resource chairperson journey landslide colleague retain mainland coleman repeatedly department thin realize station reporter consider local evidence framework contact accord due livelihood john diverse grassroots pacific platform originally witness chose late reelection listen role political experience history construction october concert answer turnout museum operation home university sits prepare airline commitment constituency play municipal candidate limited simply envision promotional tien ago turn require national obtain period former press opposition emphasis civil absent field affair year lack connect resident boost stun supporter step post michael dismissal follow burn kong member result found december clear famous amendment introduce passenger sufficient official leader reflect chow visit rate judicial difficulty hurdle speech associate obedient kwun politician chance russell party lee make camp voter sentiment fail court booth city victory july administration professor organize network rode instead ip winnie obstacle plan refuse recent unfavorable eliminate secure work option liberty movement directly rubric determine loyalist geographical lawmaker comeback discount group failure cathay pool love rival participate heart serve place join jay shift seek wave low outdoor elect ability reply challenge democracy legitimacy sustain representative decide focus honorary vote future include activity endorsement run primarily council point government recognize association backward protest insufficient prove impossible ensure packed widely time race familiar colony unfairness airway beijing poon buying prominent exit reasonable tong count hopeful undermine farewell election age subway district gather assembly height community politically territory pass british call advertisement committee,0.99125,0.0,11.53523520485584,0.4112157943067034,0,2023-12-07
ABC,"Journalists' rights group counts 94 media workers killed worldwide, most at an alarming rate in Gaza",2023-12-07 19:32:00,The Associated Press,"BRUSSELS -- A leading organization representing journalists worldwide expressed deep concern Friday at the number of media professionals killed around the globe doing their jobs in 2023, with Israel’s war with Hamas claiming more journalists than any conflict in over 30 years.In its annual count of media worker deaths, the International Federation of Journalists said 94 journalists had been killed so far this year and almost 400 others had been imprisoned.The group called for better protection for media workers and for their attackers to be held to account.“The imperative for a new global standard for the protection of journalists and effective international enforcement has never been greater,” IFJ President Dominique Pradalié said.The group said 68 journalists had been killed covering the Israeli-Hamas war since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 — more than one a day and 72% of all media deaths worldwide. It said the overwhelming majority of them were Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces continue their offensive.“The war in Gaza has been more deadly for journalists than any single conflict since the IFJ began recording journalists killed in the line of duty in 1990,” the group said, adding that deaths have come at “a scale and pace of loss of media professionals’ lives without precedent.”Ukraine also “remains a dangerous country for journalists” almost two years since Russia's invasion, the organization said. It said three reporters and media workers had been killed in that war so far this year.The organization also deplored media deaths in Afghanistan, the Philippines, India, China and Bangladesh.It expressed concern that crimes against media workers are going unpunished and urged governments “to shed full light on these murders and to put in place measures to ensure the safety of journalists.”It noted a drop in the number of journalists killed in North and South America, from 29 last year to seven so far in 2023. The group said the three Mexicans, one Paraguayan, one Guatemalan, one Colombian and one American were slain while investigating armed groups or the embezzlement of public funds.Africa remained the region least affected by deaths of journalists, but the organization highlighted what it described as “three particularly shocking murders” in Cameroon and Lesotho that it said have yet to be fully investigated.",2384,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/journalists-rights-group-counts-94-media-workers-killed-105482422,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8443aa14-868c-468e-bc22-faaa031311ac/wirestory_ed8a0b91c02ada46aabcd4fd6ec1b0d1_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country slain worldwide ifj afghanistan paraguayan fully record dangerous brussels majority number continue line overwhelm russia kill public cover attack urge lesotho cameroon force remains american hamas highlight annual described concern dominique shed professional full effective guatemalan enforcement journalist china israel president job represent add put day death express group particularly remain america lead scale strip crime place medium embezzlement protection global begin reporter note attacker globe deplore pradalié worker drop federation india region gaza government affected measure murder ensure colombian deadly pace north mexican international deep israeli philippine standard invasion light safety count imperative life friday unpunished year duty claim arm loss palestinian shock conflict ukraine south single held great call organization investigate,-0.97915,1.3842281879194631,12.476038647342993,0.3891301406926407,0,2023-12-07

CNN,"Who is Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader Israel has called a ‘dead man walking’",2023-12-07 14:38:00,Ivana Kottasová,"The Israeli prime minister said Wednesday that Israeli forces had surrounded the house of Yahya Sinwar, potentially closing in on the top Hamas official in Gaza – and the man most wanted by Israeli authorities.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sinwar was not in the house and was believed to be hiding underground in Gaza, but a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that it was “only a matter of time before we get him.”Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ terror attack against Israel on October 7 – though experts say he is likely one of several – making him one of the key targets of its war in Gaza.A longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas’ military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group’s civilian and political leader.He was elected to Hamas’ main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza branch. However, he has since become the Politburo’s de facto leader, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).He has been designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State since 2015, and has been recently sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France.Harel Chorev, senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that while Sinwar is a key player within Hamas, he shouldn’t be seen as its sole leader.“He is perceived as the most senior one because he has a very high public profile, but Hamas doesn’t work this way,” he said. “Hamas is a decentralized organization with several separate power centers and he is one of them.”Chorev said that while Sinwar is a prominent figure, he is one of a “triumvirate” of Hamas officials responsible for the October 7 attack, along with Mohammed al-Masri, popularly known as Mohammed Deif, the commander of the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of Hamas, and Deif’s deputy, Marwan Issa.Sinwar, with his silver head of hair and dark eyes set deep under prominent eyebrows, is by far the best known and most recognizable of the three, but it was Deif who announced the October 7 attacks.But while Sinwar has spent the past few years giving speeches and being photographed, Deif is an extremely secretive, shadowy figure who hasn’t been seen in public in decades.Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. His family was displaced from Al-Majdal, a Palestinian village in modern day Askhelon, during the Arab-Israeli war.He joined Hamas in the late 1980s and became one of the founders of its feared internal intelligence apparatus, known as the Majd.He was convicted in 1988 of playing a role in the murder of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians suspected of collaboration with Israel, and spent more than two decades in Israeli prison.Sinwar later said he had spent those years studying his enemy, including learning to speak Hebrew.He was released in 2011 as part of the deal that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Gilad Shalit, an IDF soldier who had been captured and taken to Gaza, where he was held for more than five years.At that time, Sinwar called the exchange “one of the big strategic monuments in the history of our cause.”Chorev said his release was helped by the fact that his brother was one of Shalit’s kidnappers and insisted on him being included in the deal.Back in Gaza, Sinwar has risen through the ranks and quickly became a key player within Hamas. Chorev said he became known for his brutality and the violence he inflicts on anyone he suspects of betrayal or collaboration.“It is well known that while in prison, he tortured people, mostly members of Hamas, using (a) hot plate to cause them burns… his role in the Majd really tells you a lot about his character, his cruelty. But at the same time, Israelis who met him said that he can also be very practical, openly discussing options,” Chorev said.As the political leader of Hamas, Sinwar focused on the group’s foreign relationships. According to the ECFR, he was responsible for restoring Hamas’ relationship with Egyptian leaders who were wary of the group’s support for political Islam, and for pulling in continued military funding from Iran.Sinwar was considered a vital decisionmaker and likely the main point of contact within Gaza during the intense negotiations over the return of the more than 240 hostages taken into the enclave by Hamas in the October 7 attacks. The talks involved senior figures from Israel, Hamas, the United States, Qatar and Egypt.“At the end of the day there are two people” atop the negotiations, said Gershon Baskin, a well-known Israeli peace activist involved in the 2011 release of Shalit, the Israeli soldier. “One is Yahya Sinwar on the Hamas side, and the other is Benjamin Netanyahu on the Israeli side.”More than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages were released by Hamas and 240 Palestinian prisoners and detainees released by Israel as part of a truce won in those talks, before the temporary ceasefire collapsed on December 1, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for the failure.Sinwar has been called many things over the past two months: Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht called Sinwar the “face of evil” and declared him a “dead man walking.” Israeli media compared him to Osama bin Laden, while a profile published by the IDF nicknamed him “the Butcher from Khan Younis.”But Chorev said that despite his position in the spotlight, Sinwar is just one of many commanders Israel needs to remove before it can say it has “destroyed Hamas.”“To put it simply, if Israel will kill Sinwar, it doesn’t mean necessarily that it will topple down Hamas. However, Hamas can still be toppled down even if Sinwar stays alive … because it’s not (a hierarchical orgnization). In order for Israel to destroy Hamas, it needs to destroy a critical mass of power centers, not just him,” he said.",6036,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-profile-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230814170035-ivana-kottasova-profile-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,european player funding khan born enclave spotlight lot top aviv islamist insist return shadowy public pull askhelon strategic mass netanyahu critical relationship side expert refugee continued rank islam deif truce popularly power body branch ceasefire temporary senior compare hostage mohammed prisoner deputy monument brother matter relation put deal ecfr day adviser responsible study decade key brigade release learn yahya african displace suspect wednesday medium decisionmaker global risen dark department head consider contact accord prime wary military late eastern past role political history gaza southern october violence designate facto modern set plate figure university spokesman tel underground hair talk play dayan simply israeli peace gershon center accuse closing year publish shalit spent detainee declare dead palestinian regional hierarchical member held recognizable marwan intense negotiation december collaboration extremely official leader middle despite triumvirate quickly perceive village speech idf character qatar defense kill attack atop force make camp stay founder forge sole internal hamas exchange foreign alive eye chorev restore wing hot tie egyptian united family fear believe butcher work brutality terrorist israel recently option discuss support destroyed destroy hecht month apparatus convict younis profile minister part publicly group osama prison benjamin arab research evil building surround inflicts hiding fact state mastermind topple remove join elect enemy high richard civilian big betrayal decentralize cruelty speak focus photograph position soldier researcher include torture important council kidnapper point vital give laden kingdom blame murder announce involve time order collapse house moshe deep baskin target intelligence secretive potentially sanction prominent terror politburo gilad commander practical arm orgnization necessarily capture separate nickname openly longtime silver call sinwar organization eyebrow activist,-0.9952,0.2485089463220676,9.46126188418323,0.4132514122992847,0,2023-12-07
NPR,Reuters releases investigation finding Israeli tank fire killed 1 of its journalists,2023-12-07 13:58:00,Jane Arraf,"The camera that belonged to Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah, who was killed by what a Reuters investigation has found was an Israeli tank crew, is displayed during a press conference by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in Beirut, Lebanon, on Thursday. BEIRUT, Lebanon — Investigations conducted by two news organizations and two human rights groups have concluded an Israeli tank round killed a Reuters video journalist near the Lebanese border in October and that Israeli forces either knew or should have known they were targeting journalists. The reports are the first public investigative findings of any killing of a journalist in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas — a conflict that has been one of the deadliest for media in recent history. The Committee to Protect Journalists has confirmed the death of at least 63 journalists and media workers since the Gaza war began. They include 56 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese journalists. The Israeli military said after the attack that it was investigating the incident. It has not yet issued any findings. Israeli military officials have said repeatedly that they do not target journalists. Lebanese video journalist Issam Abdallah, 37, was killed and a photographer for Agence France-Presse, Christina Assi, 28, was severely wounded in the Oct. 13 attack. At least five others were also wounded. The news teams were covering clashes along the border where Israel and the militia Hezbollah were trading fire. All were wearing protective vests and helmets — most clearly marked ""PRESS"" — during more than an hour in which they reported from the same location, according to the Reuters investigation. ""The Israeli military knew or should have known that they were civilians yet attacked them anyway in two separate strikes 37 seconds apart,"" Amnesty International said in a report released Thursday. A separate report released by Human Rights Watch echoed the findings by Amnesty, Reuters and AFP. Reuters said an Israeli helicopter had hovered overhead before the first strike. At least one of the press vehicles had tape spelling out ""TV"" on the roof. The reports released Thursday found no evidence of military targets near the journalists. Reuters said evidence of Israeli tank round shrapnel was found embedded in a vehicle and in body armor. Abdallah was killed instantly while Assi, who can be heard in a video screaming as a camera continued to roll after the attack, had her leg severed and is still in hospital. Reuters said it spoke to more than 30 government and security officials, forensics and weapons experts and others for its investigation. Reuters said the journalists were over half a mile from the border with Israel when they were attacked. Its report included a timeline including an image of live video of smoke rising from behind a hill being filmed by Abdallah. After 45 minutes of filming the camera focused on an Israeli outpost and tank firing into Lebanon. Less than 90 seconds later the first of two tank rounds fired from another hill hit the team, killing Abdullah. A second round 37 seconds later set a car used by Al Jazeera on fire. Two journalists from the Lebanese network Al Mayadeen were killed in another attack in Lebanon on Nov. 21 as they filmed near the border. Human rights officials said the multiple sources of video and other images from the attack on Abdallah and the other journalists made it possible to carry out unusually detailed analysis. That is not the case with most of the other attacks, either in Lebanon or in Gaza.",3564,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217855847/reuters-journalist-death-issam-abdallah-israel,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,tv heard belong wound investigation ongoing hill minute case protective photographer kill public fire cover attack force weapon make scream expert armor half possible vehicle analysis continued hamas deadliest finding severely network body recent detailed roof instantly hour vest journalist israel tape hover wear leg christina roll death group investigative overhead shrapnel release multiple agence incident amnesty crew beirut spell conference conclude medium image abdallah film repeatedly mayadeen civilian begin strike car carry militia evidence accord focus afp abdullah protect include marked embed live outpost hospital forensics military worker video history unusually gaza issam tank october government clash smoke set spoke conduct thursday displayed reuters echoed issue camera international hit round helmet lebanese israeli news target border confirm trading press watch knew lebanon location hezbollah timeline mile palestinian assi conflict helicopter jazeera source human investigate separate rise report security found sever organization official committee team,-0.9804,0.6734006734006733,10.171197511664072,0.2883333333333333,0,2023-12-07
CNN,British Foreign Secretary David Cameron urges US Congress to pass Ukraine aid package,2023-12-07 12:03:00,Rob Picheta,"Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron has urged US lawmakers to “lift the morale” of Ukraine by passing an aid package for Kyiv that has become entangled in Republican quarrelling.Cameron, a former British prime minister, told CNN during a trip to Washington, DC, on Thursday that the US is “the lynchpin” of the Western coalition backing Ukraine’s fight against Russia.His intervention comes a day after Republicans in the Senate blocked foreign aid from advancing in protest over the package’s lack of changes to border and immigration policy.“Most of the people I met on the Hill yesterday support backing Ukraine, because it’s the right thing to do,” Cameron told CNN, though he avoided commenting on Republicans’ demands on immigration. “This is an investment into their success, and the worst thing in the world would be to allow Putin a win in Ukraine – not just because that would be bad in itself, but (because) he’d be back for more.”The Senate has struggled for weeks as it tied immigration and border security policy – one of Congress’ historically most divisive issues – to a legislative package for sending aid to key US allies, among them Israel and Ukraine.Republicans’ insistence on changes to border policy have led to increased tension on Capitol Hill, including a classified briefing earlier this week that devolved into a closed-door shouting match.Cameron met with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday as part of a two-day charm offensive aimed at reaffirming support for Ukraine. On Thursday, he will meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.“There’s no doubt that America coming forward with this package will lift the morale of Ukrainians, (and) it will make sure Europe focuses on doing more,” Cameron said. “If you add up military and civilian (support), European nations are doing more than the US, and I think that’s important and quite right.”Cameron was Britain’s prime minister for six years before resigning in 2016, in the wake of voters’ decision to leave the European Union, a move that he opposed. He unexpectedly returned to politics last month when he accepted the role of foreign secretary.Britain has taken a leading role in providing support and assistance to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The UK has invested £9.3 billion ($11.7 billion) in military, humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine since the start of the war, it said this week.But tensions among Republicans in Washington over continued military assistance threaten to create a major crack in Ukraine’s Western alliance.US President Joe Biden on Wednesday urged Congress to resolve negotiations over the future of Ukraine funding, saying “petty partisan politics can’t get in the way” of aid for Kyiv.“History’s going to judge harshly those who turn their back on freedom’s cause,” the president said. “We can’t let Putin win.”His administration’s package includes about $60 billion in aid toward Ukraine’s defenses against Russia, with the rest going toward Israel’s war with Hamas, security in Taiwan and funding for operations at the US-Mexico border. Top Republicans, weary of adding more to the $111 billion the US has already sent to Ukraine, have asked that any further funding be tied to major immigration-related policy changes.Cameron also reiterated British support for Israel in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attacks, but urged the country to abide by international law in its response. He backed remarks by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who told CNN on Wednesday that Israel is taking some “important steps” to better protect civilians during its offensive in southern Gaza.Cameron said Blinken, whom he will meet on Thursday, made “a series of points about how Israel is trying to behave differently in the south of Gaza to the north of Gaza, and I think that is right, and we should continue to make those points to them.”“Ultimately the long-term security of Israel does depend not only on their own armed strength and fortitude, but also on having Palestinians able to live in peace and security as well,” Cameron said.A humanitarian crisis has unfolded in Gaza, where Israeli air and ground assaults have left Palestinians displaced and in dire need of food, supplies and medical care.Cameron has visited Israel and Ukraine in his first weeks as foreign secretary. He resisted calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, telling CNN: “If we leave Hamas in charge of even a part of Gaza, there will never be a two-state solution because you can’t expect Israel to live next to a group of people that want to do October 7 all over again.”",4603,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/europe/david-cameron-ukraine-cnn-gbr-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230627130758-rob-picheta-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country european funding send increase depend response change top hill back return win continue reaffirm russia resolve urge tension doubt resign charge major continued economic britain ceasefire mike western leave antony ukrainian aim lynchpin assault politics struggle partisan start law taiwan day told key cnn demand devolve yesterday legislative senate america entangle unfolded displace resist lift wednesday avoid biden petty move package prime live military nation role history gaza historically southern october advance supply operation secretary north republican congress wake abide international unexpectedly israeli peace border speaker turn fight former backing remark year lack step palestinian dire passing shout negotiation rest divisive visit meet defense threaten dc trip strength attack judge make europe voter blinken ally aid forward hamas policy foreign administration expect crisis air uk tie medical success israel support charm president investment lawmaker month add humanitarian minister part johnson offensive comment group accepted david reiterate ground week lead state crack union decision food focus earlier future protect include important cameron kyiv point left weary world protest solution february behave coalition thursday putin capitol joe issue washington harshly invest house immigration differently provide invasion insistence ultimately immediate create intervention oppose block arm freedom fortitude ukraine south classify billion security briefing call british civilian assistance series,-0.2763,0.4562242016076472,9.527194570135745,0.3864258347016966,0,2023-12-07
Washington Post,News investigations say Israeli tank shell killed journalist in Lebanon,2023-12-07 11:25:00,Mohamad El Chamaa,"BEIRUT — News organizations and rights groups that investigated shelling that killed a journalist and injured others in Lebanon in October said their findings indicate that Israel was responsible.Two rights groups described the attack as a “war crime.”The shelling on Oct. 13 in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah, 37, and severely wounded Agence France-Presse photographer Christina Assi, 28.

Present in the audience were Abdallah’s family members, as well as Al Jazeera cameraman Elie Brakhya, who was injured Oct. 13, with one arm still in a cast and the other bandaged.After a moment of silence to mourn journalists killed in the conflict, Dylan Collins, an AFP videographer who was with Abdallah when he was killed, recounted the events of that day, saying he was there “to serve as a witness to what happened.”He and his colleague Assi, as well as Abdallah, had set up on a hilltop near Alma al-Chaab, where they found the Al Jazeera crew broadcasting as well.“We felt safe, we felt secure, so we got to work, seven journalists, all of us wearing flak jackets and helmets, everyone clearly marked as a member of the press,” he said. “The Israelis knew we were there from the moment we arrived.”Shortly before 6 p.m. local time, Collins said, they turned their cameras west as the sun was setting.“There was smoke, and then boom, we were hit,” he said. Collins said he went to tend to Assi, who was on the ground screaming that “she couldn’t feel her legs.” While tending to her wounds, a second strike hit the Al Jazeera car next to them, Collins said. “I looked up and saw a leg next to the Al Jazeera car, which I later realized belonged to Issam.”They did not find his body until the ambulance came, Collins added. “He was blown through the wall he was standing next to. He landed amid the rubble, his body charred almost beyond recognition.”Assi is still in a hospital recovering from her wounds, Collins said. He read a message that she asked him to pass on: “We choose journalism with a mission to deliver the truth, and despite the inevitable costs, our commitment remains unwavering. Nothing can silence us.”The investigations by the four groups drew on analysis from munitions experts, satellite images, witness testimony and images captured at the scene before and after the attacks.Reuters said in its report Thursday that “an Israeli tank crew killed a Reuters journalist and wounded six reporters in Lebanon on Oct. 13 by firing two shells in quick succession from Israel while the journalists were filming cross-border shelling.”Reuters said it obtained evidence from the scene, including shrapnel on the ground and embedded in a Reuters car, three flak jackets, a camera, tripod and a large piece of metal. The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, a research institute that tests and analyzes munitions, found that the metal piece “was the tail fin of a 120mm tank round fired by a smoothbore tank gun positioned 1.34 km away from the reporters, across the Lebanese border,” Reuters said.Reuters editor in chief Alessandra Galloni condemned the killing in a statement and called on “Israel to explain how this could have happened and to hold to account those responsible.”AFP, which conducted its separate investigation in partnership with Airwars, a human rights nonprofit based in Britain, said the evidence it collected on the deadly strikes “points to a tank round used only by the Israeli army in this high-tension border region.”AFP said in its report that it was able to come to “three key conclusions.” One is that the munition that killed Abdallah was of Israeli origin and “is not used by any other groups in the region.” Another, it said, is that “the strikes were deliberate and targeted,” coming close together in time and space and hitting journalists who “were clearly identified as press, away from any military activity.” Finally, it said, “the strikes likely came from southeast of the journalists’ position, apparently near the Israeli village of Jordeikh where Israeli tanks were operating.”Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher for Human Rights Watch, told the news conference that the evidence reviewed by his organization shows “that the Israeli army knew or should have known that the people they were firing on were civilians and journalists.”Human Rights Watch said in a statement Thursday that the journalists “were well removed from ongoing hostilities, clearly identifiable as members of the media, and had been stationary for at least 75 minutes before they were hit by two consecutive strikes.” It said it found “no evidence of a military target near the journalists’ location.”Amnesty International made similar points and said the attack “must be investigated as a war crime.” It said that even though “the group was visibly identifiable as journalists,” the Israeli military “attacked them anyway in two separate strikes 37 seconds apart.”At a news conference Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was “deeply sorry for this loss.”“It is important and appropriate that it [the strike] be fully and thoroughly investigated,” Blinken said.Eylon Levy, a spokesman for Israel’s government, said Thursday that he was not familiar with the findings of the investigations but said Israel respects international law and does not target civilians. The Israel Defense Forces previously said it was investigating the incident, and a spokesman for the Israeli military said in October it was “very sorry” for the journalist’s death but that it was not sure who was responsible.The Washington Post has not independently reviewed the material that investigators found at the scene.An eyewitness told The Post at the time that the strikes came from the Israeli side and that there was no indication that fire from Lebanon was coming from anywhere near the journalists.Video posted at the time also indicated that several reporters at the site were wearing blue bullet-resistant vests marked with the word “Press.” The Associated Press — which had a photographer at the scene — reported that an Israeli shell landed near the group during an exchange of fire with Hezbollah.Assi suffered “life-changing injuries including the amputation of her leg,” Collins told the news conference. He said the strikes left the other journalists in the group with “shrapnel wounds and other scars.”When asked who should investigate the attack, Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said that “Israel is obligated to investigate and hold members of its military accountable.” She asked Lebanese authorities to make the technical report they prepared after the incident available to the public.Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty also asked the United States to investigate the incident because a U.S. national, Dylan Collins, was targeted.Dozens of journalists have been killed as a result of the war in Gaza — at such a high rate that the Committee to Protect Journalists, which tracks reported deaths and injuries of journalists in conflict, said October was “the deadliest month for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.” The CPJ said Wednesday that at least 63 journalists and media workers have been killed and 11 injured since the war began Oct. 7.",7632,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/reuter-journalist-issam-abdallah-killed-lebanon-israel-attack/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,army available wound investigation respect ongoing minute char fire satellite remains independently partnership scream side expert track tail hostility finding close nonprofit large described severely scientific origin smoothbore body audience britain similar moment ramzi happen africa jacket deputy antony shortly leg christina km mourn law review day metal amid told cost key cameraman amnesty majzoub cast wednesday medium colleague present film explain realize cpj strike silence reporter begin deliver local evidence succession inevitable embed event witness capital military worker fin hilltop apparently gaza southern october issam stand set suffer injured deliberate secretary conduct ambulance west spokesman north scene commitment reuters international levy site round helmet test lebanese collins wall israeli border turn rubble obtain national knew press alessandra lebanon gun quick galloni post assi regional away member condemn deeply result report found drew felt middle prepared despite belong flak rate dylan village fully associate recover visibly defense amputation photographer morning sorry blown kill journalism attack shell munition force make jointly blinken chief kaiss analysis exchange deadliest analyzes appropriate united family gathering videographer safe secure sun indication journalist work vest israel boom alma choose wear month land add blue data death group message find research shrapnel base elie agence incident ground netherlands southeast beirut conference crew state serve remove finally jordeikh image abdallah identify injury feel high identifiable car word obligate piece brakhya position afp collect researcher protect include marked hospital director material space important unwavering point tank government previously left smoke packed account indicate deadly technical time hold thursday familiar statement camera washington hit airwars mission authority tend news tripod truth target testimony show apply watch eyewitness east arm investigator jazeera recount conflict human capture investigate separate institute read call stationary consecutive organization editor civilian broadcasting committee,-0.98135,0.4323899371069182,10.618568391211909,0.314780753968254,0,2023-12-07
NPR,"Sen. Bernie Sanders says aid to Israel should be conditional, citing the toll on Gaza",2023-12-07 10:44:00,Rachel Treisman,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, pictured at a committee hearing last month, joined Republican senators in blocking aid to Israel and Ukraine. He tells NPR why he thinks support for Israel's military should have strings attached. The Senate voted 49 to 51 on Wednesday not to advance a bill that would provide billions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel, aid the White House says is essential for safeguarding democracy across the globe. Republicans made good on their threat to block consideration of the bill unless it included their preferred border security and immigration measures. They were joined by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats — and one of Congress' most prominent progressives. Sanders voted no for a different reason, as he later explained in a statement: ""I do not believe that we should give the right-wing extremist Netanyahu government an additional $10.1 billion dollars with no strings attached to continue their inhumane war against the Palestinian people."" In floor remarks and a letter to Democrats earlier this week, Sanders said he agreed with many of the bill's provisions, including its support for humanitarian aid and Ukraine's right to defend itself. But he criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, noting that it has killed some 16,000 Palestinians and displaced another 1.8 million from their homes in Gaza. He also pointed to Israeli settler violence and a growing Palestinian death toll in the West Bank. ""[Israel has] the right to go to war against Hamas, who committed an atrocious invasion of their country,"" Sanders told NPR's Morning Edition before Wednesday's vote. ""But they do not have the right to go to war against the Palestinian people."" Sanders told Morning Edition's Michel Martin that he believes the only way the U.S. can tell Netanyahu that ""his military tactics are unacceptable"" is to not give him a blank check for the $10 billion that President Biden's security package seeks. He does support giving Israel $4 billion to replenish its Iron Dome, a decade-old network of radar detectors and missile launchers that intercepts incoming rockets. But he said further U.S. aid to Israel should come with conditions, adding that ""we cannot allow Israeli settlers to kill Palestinians on the West Bank"" and ""have got to also make it clear that the people of Gaza have a right to return and rebuild their homes."" ""And maybe most importantly, we need a commitment from the Netanyahu government that there will be a two-state solution, that the Palestinians in the area have a right to their own homeland, to live with security and dignity,"" Sanders said. Unlike some of his fellow progressives, Sanders has not called for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. He told NPR that would be unrealistic, given Hamas' stated goal of destroying Israel. He says the changes needed in the region — now in its fifth war in 15 years — can only happen under new leadership in Gaza. While Israel aims to remove Hamas from power, it remains unclear who would step in to govern the territory. ""You need new Palestinian leadership which pays attention to the needs of the Palestinian people and understands that Israel has a right to exist in a two-state situation,"" Sanders said. ""Not Hamas."" The question of financial support for the militaries of Ukraine and Israel has both dominated and divided Capitol Hill in recent months. In October, Biden asked Congress for nearly $106 billion in funding for Israel, Ukraine, countering China and border security. The package included some $14 billion for Israel and more than $61 billion for Ukraine, which the Biden administration has repeatedly warned is running out of money to defend itself from Russia. House Republicans are increasingly opposed to sending more aid to Ukraine, though they did approve a $14.5 billion military aid package for Israel (funded by cuts to the IRS) last month. The Democratic-controlled Senate said it would reject it, since it didn't include money for Ukraine, humanitarian aid in Gaza and other Biden administration priorities. Some Democrats have also raised questions about aid to Israel. A majority of Senate Democrats — as well as Sanders and independent Maine Sen. Angus King — wrote Biden a letter last month asking him to defend his request for aid and ensure that Israel will use U.S. military assistance in keeping with international law. After Wednesday's failed vote, Biden accused Republicans of ""playing chicken"" with the package by demanding ""partisan"" border policies, but also indicated he would be open to making compromises in order to get the bill passed. A bipartisan negotiating group working border policy in the Senate has been unable to overcome disagreements around asylum policy and other border security issues. Republicans have warned that they will not agree to a broader security bill without resolving the border issue. The president said Congress must approve funding for Ukraine before it goes on holiday recess late next week, or else it will be giving Russian president Vladimir Putin a gift. Sanders agrees, adding that he expected that Congress would need to go back to the drawing board and hopes it can ""do the best that we can ... as soon as we can."" ""I do think that it's absolutely imperative, that we need a spending bill right now, which makes it clear to Putin that the United States and the rest of the democratic world are supportive of Ukraine and other democracies,"" Sanders said. ""And I think humanitarian aid for Gaza and other parts of the world are desperately needed."" Sanders also weighed in on a recent incident in his home state, in which a man shot three college students of Palestinian descent as they walked down the street in Burlington, speaking Arabic and wearing keffiyehs. All three survived, though one could face permanent paralysis in his legs due to a bullet lodged in his spine. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime. Sanders said the attack took place a mile from where he lives, calling it ""beyond belief and ... unspeakable."" He described the victims as ""really bright, lovely young men"" and said he had spoken to one of them recently. And he alluded to the broader context, in which reports of antisemitic, Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian incidents have skyrocketed in the wake of Oct. 7. ""That adds to all of the stress and ugliness that we're seeing taking place today,"" he said. ""It is a tough time for our country, to say the least."" Sanders said in a democratic society, people have the right to disagree and participate in the political process. But they cannot, he said, translate their political views ""into hatred of an entire people."" ""This country has gone through hundreds of years of bigotry and hatred,"" he added. ""We're trying to climb our way out of it. Let's not recede into tribalism and hatred just because of somebody's religion.""

Washington Post,Divisions over Gaza roil World Food Program as staff confront Cindy McCain,2023-12-07 10:41:00,not specified,"World Food Program employees confronted the U.N. agency’s director, Cindy McCain, last week, asserting that she was indifferent to the plight of staff at the front lines of the agency’s effort to feed hungry Gazans under siege by Israel, according to a recording of a staff meeting and interviews with four WFP employees.Tensions between McCain and agency staff came to a head in a Nov. 30 call, in which WFP workers in the Middle East and North Africa also criticized her decision to appear at an event where an award in her husband’s name was given to the Israeli people, potentially compromising the agency’s efforts to feed Palestinians in Gaza, staff said.Israel said last month that “no electricity, no food, no fuel” would be allowed to enter the densely populated enclave. Since then, Israel has allowed some aid to enter Gaza — particularly during a week-long pause in fighting — though global health organizations have warned that the amount of aid trickling into Gaza is not commensurate to the need.In the WFP video conference, a recording of which was obtained by The Washington Post, staff asked McCain why the agency, which is tasked with “delivering food assistance in emergencies,” has not said that food is being used as a weapon of war in Gaza, as it has in places like Ethiopia and Yemen. McCain, in the video conference, said she was remaining “neutral,” adding that because the U.N. secretary general has not yet used those terms, WFP would not.Staff also raised concerns about McCain’s apparent absence at a moment of silence held in Rome for the more than 100 U.N. workers killed in Gaza, leading to an awkward interaction in which her deputies scrambled to decide who should lead the gathering. McCain said in the call that she was in attendance, but on the sidelines.A spokesperson for WFP said in a statement that McCain “observed the moment of silence” in front of a memorial wall at the agency’s headquarters, and opened remarks to the executive board the same day “by acknowledging the moment of silence and paying tribute to our team in Gaza.”“The deaths of over 100 of our U.N. colleagues in Gaza is unacceptable,” the spokesperson added, “and we stand in solidarity to mourn all of them who have died in the conflict.”One staffer of WFP’s operations in Gaza told McCain on the call that for “54 days your staff, our teams have been living through hell.” The employee, apparently getting choked up, paused, at which point McCain said, “Do you have a question?”“Where were you, Mrs. Executive Director?” the employee responded. “We have neither your presence nor your action and not even your voice for Gaza.”WFP workers said it is common for executive directors to visit conflict zones where the agency is serving people. McCain noted she had visited Egypt, which has led negotiations for aid to enter the Gaza Strip.“Using the strength and parameters of WFP’s mandate, the Executive Director and her leadership team are working tirelessly to get lifesaving aid to the millions in Gaza in desperate need,” the WFP spokesperson said.Four WFP employees who spoke with The Post on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retribution, said they were disappointed that McCain had not been more forceful in condemning Israel’s siege of Gaza.They have urged her to explicitly call for a humanitarian cease-fire; McCain signed on to a joint statement by the heads of U.N. agencies last month calling for such an action but has not done so individually. The head of another U.N. agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of the World Health Organization, called for a cease-fire a week before the joint statement was issued. The WFP spokesperson said McCain has supported U.N. Secretary General António Guterres’s call for a humanitarian cease-fire “on multiple occasions,” adding that “she has made it clear that, more than anything, what is needed is peace.”McCain, speaking from Phoenix, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” in November that Gaza was possibly ""on the brink of famine,” adding that more aid needed to be let into the enclave. “It is a massive, catastrophic event that is occurring,” she said. WFP said last week that it has provided food to 120,000 Gazans, “but thousands more people need support.”Employees on the call also lamented McCain’s attendance at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, where an award named for McCain’s late husband, Sen. John McCain, was given to “the people of Israel.”McCain interrupted the employee, saying, “I will always support the legacy of my husband. No one will ever take that away from me. So if you disagree with where I went to Halifax, or if you disagree with me supporting my husband, then that’s a disagreement that we’re going to have.”The employee attempted to continue speaking, at which point McCain said, “I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it. I’m done now. I’m done.”McCain’s “condescending, disrespectful” demeanor on the call further angered staff, one employee told The Post.McCain is not a member of the forum and was not involved in the selection process for the award, the WFP spokesperson said. “Ms McCain attended as the widow of her late husband of 40 years and in support of Mr. McCain’s legacy,” the spokesperson said.Still, her appearance at the event, where she also spoke about combating world hunger — her remarks named Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and South Sudan, but not Gaza — was a violation of the humanitarian principle of impartiality, WFP employees told The Post.The staff members said that any perceived impartiality endangers workers on the ground in conflict zones, where militant groups may withhold access to provide aid, threaten or harm employees. The perception that WFP is aligned with Israel would make the work difficult for WFP staff in the Middle East and North Africa, the employees said.McCain took the helm of the agency in April after serving as the U.S. ambassador to U.N. agencies, another posting in Rome. In an April interview on CBS’s “Sunday Morning” program, McCain was asked about having to remain politically neutral in her new role. As U.S. ambassador, McCain had made comments critical of Russia, the program noted. But as a U.N. agency head, McCain is forbidden from taking sides.",6250,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/cindy-mccain-world-food-program-gaza-israel/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,leadership raise enclave enter respond hunger condition november record confront militant continue line perception russia unacceptable urge neutral critical amount weapon side sunday forum headquarters condescend trickle catastrophic agency ghebreyesus tedros warn husband interview halifax brink moment zone angered parameter africa deputy effort mandate open difficult front mourn day told particularly democratic remain multiple executive harm april occasion tribute emergency commensurate colleague global presence silence head deliver helm accord solidarity john event common cindy worker nation video late role apparently gaza board living meeting tasked stand spoke operation secretary ethiopia million assert north possibly sign action observe impartiality choked international retribution forceful wall israeli staffer fight obtain remark year populate rome post acknowledge palestinian away member held condemn attend mccain explicitly spokesperson negotiation clear sudan team middle desperate visit endangers perceive absence program pause morning electricity threaten strength kill appearance make selection aid yemen joint individually interaction awkward concern memorial access somalia gathering fear demeanor antónio work israel principle support month violation question legacy add feed humanitarian egypt comment death group criticize densely gazans term congo ground week lead conference cbs serve place combat decision food staff scramble occur adhanom note decide fuel speak famine tirelessly guterres attendance pay process director republic general disagreement lament point give nova world wfp apparent employee health withhold involve plight disagree disrespectful statement issue washington voice siege award potentially provide forbidden lifesaving east widow thousand phoenix scotia compromise conflict ukraine south align hungry anonymity massive ambassador attempt security interrupt politically call indifferent organization assistance disappointed,-0.99485,0.4319999999999999,8.476704361873988,0.4142529950669484,0,2023-12-07
CNN,"As Western unity on Ukraine falters, Putin eyes a slow-burn win",2023-12-07 09:12:00,Nick Paton Walsh,"This is the moment Russian President Vladimir Putin has been waiting for: when he doesn’t really need to do much, and can call it a win.The static frontlines in Ukraine are slowly hardening as the snow deepens. In Kyiv, there is a palpable sense of once-insurmountable morale ebbing slightly. There is open talk of disagreement between the commander-in-chief and the chief of staff – Volodymyr Zelensky and Valery Zaluzhny.Russia is no longer losing the war, or the terrain it seized, and so Ukraine is definitely not winning it. Across European capitals, elections loom and even the farmers of stalwart ally Poland are picking quarrels with their Ukrainian neighbours.In the United States, Senate Republicans blocked a legislative package including $60 billion in aid for Ukraine from advancing Wednesday evening, amid a standoff with the Democrats over US border and immigration policy.In an attempt to break the impasse, US President Joe Biden had appealed earlier Wednesday for Congress not to let “petty partisan politics” get in the way of aid for Kyiv. “History’s going to judge harshly those who turn their back on freedom’s cause,” the president said. “We can’t let Putin win.”Britain’s newly appointed Foreign Secretary David Cameron was due to speak Thursday alongside US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, as the United Kingdom, too, urges continued international support for Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion.The unity of purpose and intent - so remarkable for the first 21 months of Europe’s most consequential event since the fall of the Berlin Wall - had always been an outlier. More disarray and disunity looms.In Washington, the uncertainty on display is more baffling. Congress’s reluctance to provide urgently needed aid is often billed as concerned Republicans not wanting to drag the US into another conflict. But the aid is meant precisely to prevent that: to ensure that Ukraine can keep fighting Moscow, rather than permit Putin to advance near enough NATO’s borders that the US is forced to fight for its allies in person, not via proxy.A gentle blame game has begun, with extensive articles outlining why the Ukrainian counteroffensive failed to deliver the long-telegraphed results it needed. The Washington Post quoted anonymous US officials explaining Kyiv moved too late, or listened too little.Ukrainian officials must still marvel at their allies expecting them to pull off complex military assaults minus the air superiority without which a NATO army would not even get out of bed.It is a slow drain of vigor that Putin has surely long wished for. And it is a remarkable turnaround for an authoritarian leader who barely six months ago faced an open but short-lived rebellion from henchman Yevgeny Prigozhin.Prigozhin is dead, killed with his other top Wagner figures in a mysterious plane crash. Moscow is rich on oil money. The prisons are filling the trenches with seemingly inexhaustible cannon fodder. Russia’s military has got back on its feet and has, for the most part, so far held back Ukraine’s counteroffensive – along with the billions of dollars of NATO training and arms that went into it.The frontlines tell three tales. To the west, Ukraine has made a plucky - if hard to sustain - dive across the Dnipro River to create a bridgehead and threatens to attack Russia’s access to Crimea from the west. The nearby city of Kherson pays the price, shelled daily, and ghostly. Ukraine may see luck on this front, but will need a lot of it to make a difference and keep its forces resupplied.To the center, the frontlines below Zaporizhzhia, for months the key focus of Ukraine’s attacks towards the city of Melitopol, are largely unchanged. A breakthrough here was the hope - the key result the West and Kyiv could have called a victory, cutting Russia’s mainland off from annexed Crimea - but it may not happen. The snows and darkness ahead will slow fighting further.And to the east, a more troubling rhythm is forming around the town of Avdiivka. Of little strategic value, it is a symbol of Russia’s limitless tolerance of pain and casualties to achieve a basic, grinding victory. Its forces are slowly surrounding the town, much like they did with the city of Bakhmut earlier this year. They may take it, and lose thousands doing so. And the fear is that this is how they will move forward, throughout Ukraine. One tiny, costly victory at a time.The biggest advantage Putin has is a West out of ideas - an alliance which saw its main strategy with Kyiv fail, and now thinks that more-of-the-same aid is essentially futile as the war cannot be decisively won.Soon, Putin may appear more amenable to negotiations, and Europe may nudge Kyiv towards them for peace of mind. Yet this is despite most Western leaders being acutely aware that Putin cannot be trusted, and that Moscow uses diplomacy as a useful trick to advance its military aims. Any peace deal might last just long enough to allow Putin to refit, re-equip and then come back for more of Ukraine.A victory in the US presidential election next year for Donald Trump would throw into this highly dangerous mix for European security a US president with an inexplicable fondness for the Kremlin head. Trump boasts he could forge a peace deal in Ukraine within 24 hours. He will be lucky if it even lasts that long.So where do we go now? What does Ukraine do? First, the West must drop its fear of a humiliated Russia. Putin has shown - after attacks on the Russian mainland, a failed coup, and multiple ships in his Black Sea Fleet upping sticks to the safety of Russia’s main Black Sea coast - that he is not interested in escalation. He is struggling to defeat his weak neighbor and cannot take on NATO in full. The same goes for nuclear war; Putin has shown he is a pragmatic survivor, not a madman bent on global apocalypse.Second, the West must arm Ukraine to the full – and fast. The approach of supplying a slow drip of weapons has proven catastrophic: the US Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), the M1 Abrams tanks - they arrive, but too late to make much difference.Third, the West must make it clear that no peace deal with Russia can let it maintain a land corridor across southeastern Ukraine between the Russian mainland and Crimea. That will deny Moscow of something it can call a strategic victory.But most importantly, Europe and the US must retain the conviction this is an existential fight for Western security.

Washington Post,Israeli forces battle Hamas as disease spreads among the displaced,2023-12-07 08:39:00,not specified,"AMMAN, Jordan — Israeli forces fought Hamas militants in street battles across Gaza on Thursday, claiming they were closing in on the hideouts of key commanders, as the United Nations appealed for an urgent end to the war to avert an imminent “humanitarian catastrophe.”In a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, President Biden “stressed that much more assistance was urgently required across the board,” the White House said in a summary of the call. Biden also emphasized the importance of humanitarian corridors that would allow civilians to flee “areas of hostilities.”Biden appeared to blame Hamas for the collapse of a seven-day pause in the fighting last month, saying “it was Hamas’s refusal to release young women civilian hostages that led to a breakdown in the humanitarian pause.”Some of the heaviest fighting Thursday was in the southern city of Khan Younis, which Israel once advised Gazans was a safe area but which is now a major focus of the battle. A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister’s office, Eylon Levy, said the Israel Defense Forces were in “close-quarter combat against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip including Khan Younis, eliminating tunnel shafts and the terrorists operating within them.”Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, was a major destination for Palestinians fleeing the north before it became the new center of fighting. According to the United Nations, a quarter of the city’s area has been declared an evacuation zone by the Israeli military in recent days. An estimated 358,000 people, nearly half of them refugees from elsewhere in Gaza, have received evacuation orders, the office for humanitarian affairs said on Wednesday.The IDF and militants fought pitched battles in the Jabalya refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip, where local authorities said an estimated 100,000 people were at risk of starvation after two months of war. In the Jabalya and Shejaiya areas, Levy said, Israeli forces had “broken through their defensive lines and those terrorists are now emerging from their underground tunnels to engage our men in close combat.”There were reports of mass arrests of Gazan men by Israeli troops. Photographs and video footage posted by Israeli news sites and circulated on social media showed hundreds of men in their underwear, blindfolded with their hands behind their heads, seated in rows on the ground and guarded by Israeli troops. It was unclear whether the men were fighters and whether they had surrendered or were rounded up. The Israeli military did not respond to a request to confirm the images.Airstrikes continued across the Gaza Strip, including two in the southern border town of Rafah, a vital transshipment point for the faltering international aid effort, where tens of thousands of people have sought refuge in recent days.The al-Houbi family home in the Shaboura area was hit at night, and Najjar Hospital reported receiving at least 20 dead. A second house was hit in the morning, but it had been evacuated and no casualties were reported. A motorcycle carrying four men was hit near the Rafah crossing into Egypt.The Gaza Health Ministry said 350 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours, bringing to 17,177 the number who have died in Gaza during the two-month war.U.N. Secretary General António Guterres warned Wednesday evening that Gaza’s entire humanitarian system is on the brink of collapse, putting 2.1 million people at risk of death from hunger and epidemic disease.“We are simply unable to reach those in need inside Gaza,” he said, and he appealed to the international community to take “urgent” steps to stop the fighting.He invoked for the first time in his six-year tenure Article 99 of the U.N. Charter, which will force the Security Council to meet to discuss a course of action.Guterres’s appeal for an immediate cease-fire was echoed Thursday by humanitarian aid agencies, a group of which told an online briefing that disease, hunger and unsanitary conditions could soon kill as many people as the violence.“The situation in Gaza is not just a catastrophe. It’s apocalyptic,” said Bushra Khalidi, the Jerusalem-based Palestinian policy lead for Oxfam. Alexandra Saieh, the head of humanitarian policy and advocacy at Save the Children, described hospitals where amputations were being performed without anesthesia and maggots were being picked from the wounds of the injured. “We are literally running out of words to describe the horrors taking place in Gaza,” Saieh said.Conditions have deteriorated rapidly for Gaza’s residents, over 85 percent of whom have been displaced from their homes and are sleeping in many cases out in the open and without access to adequate food, clean water or shelter from the winter cold.Doctors have warned about the risk of disease spreading in overcrowded shelters and refugee camps in Gaza’s south.“Through our inspection of refugee camps, we noticed a large spread of hepatitis, which is spreading due to crowding of people, lack of usable drinking water and contaminated food,” Imad Al-Hams, an emergency physician in Rafah, told The Washington Post. “This is a serious disease that leads to death.”He said it was hard to issue official figures on the volume of infections, because of the large number of people and a lack of access for medical teams, but noted that many diseases were spreading because of poor hygiene conditions, and children were particularly at risk.Saif Al-Din Muhammad Qadouha, 45, told The Post that his home in northern Gaza was destroyed at the outset of the war, driving him to Rafah, where he and his family now live in a makeshift school shelter. “We receive water only once, for an hour, every three or four days. … I live with my family of 11 people in this tent,” he said.Israeli soldiers rounded up dozens of Palestinian men, stripped them down to their underwear and tied their hands tied behind their backs, according to a video apparently filmed in the Beit Lahia area of northern Gaza.The IDF has not commented on the footage, but IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said at a news conference Thursday that Israeli troops in Gaza have “arrested and interrogated hundreds of suspects of terrorist activity.” He said many had turned themselves in over the previous day. Hagari said the IDF detains and interrogates anyone in areas of military activity.Hani Almadhoun, a Palestinian man who lives in Washington, D.C., identified his brother, 32-year-old Mahmoud Almadhoun, and other relatives in the video clip. Almadhoun, the director of philanthropy in D.C. for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said his relatives in the video are civilians who are not associated with Hamas or any other fighters. Israeli media outlets have been reporting that the videos show members of Hamas, without citing any sources.“This is just to humiliate,” Almadhoun said. “In what planet is this okay? Why is this okay? Why are they rounding people from their homes?”Photographer Abdul Hakim Abu Rayash, a resident of Beit Lahia, confirmed to The Post that the detained included a Diaa Al-Kahlot, the Gaza bureau chief of Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed newspaper.Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general, called the images on social media “very concerning.”U.S. drones have resumed flying over Gaza, the Pentagon said Thursday. Spokeswoman Lisa Lawrence said the drones were used previously on intelligence-gathering and surveillance missions, first disclosed in early November, in support of Israel’s hostage-recovery efforts. They were suspended late last month as part of the agreement between Israel and Hamas for the pause in hostilities, officials said at the time.",7695,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/israel-hamas-khan-younis-battle-disease/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,contaminate khan dozen respond fly hunger broken condition wound november quarter bushra back relative refuge militant importance line describe seat request mass netanyahu sought motorcycle discus advise stop drive major refugee half drinking troop continued hostility close tunnel large imad described agency warn appeal mahmoud guard brink zone emerge deteriorate tenure hostage humiliate arrest tent disease effort fighter poor bureau system brother open receive put day eylon muhammad told particularly course key unable release child interrogates displace qadouha suspect school rayash reach lisa wednesday medium emergency shaft film emphasize pentagon biden head carry clean suspend destination oxfam hagari imminent local accord prime due cross casualty live alexandra military nation video late apparently najjar gaza southern crowd blindfold estimate board injured planet avert secretary dujarric home million figure spokesman north circulate underground sleep urgently outset spread young levy international site round simply saieh israeli confirm border center hakim drone turn require catastrophe fight life interrogate bring closing affair hard lack resident claim declare step post dead palestinian anesthesia breakdown hygiene member shaboura report spokesperson water advocacy flee picked official row team inside jabalya shelter khalidi makeshift social meet associate idf charter diaa case outlet defense amputation pause photographer defensive resume morning number kill fought operating overcrowd town force summary camp chief hand aid ten heaviest hamas city policy maggot early philanthropy perform falter tie medical access refusal online united recent family safe hour eliminate situation winter northern antónio terrorist inspection israel disclose detains support previous destroyed almadhoun usable president pitch article month younis hundred humanitarian physician minister part gazan comment stress death group benjamin lahia gazans underwear spokeswoman ground lead conference reporting strip hideout risk surveillance place street image combat identify shejaiya food save abu clip invoked apocalyptic note entire word focus abdul guterres soldier photograph include beit starvation hospital percent director transshipment rapidly general jordan run engage council point vital previously unrwa night blame footage woman horror lawrence health corridor notice order time thursday detain collapse echoed evacuate issue washington hit mission volume house urgent office ministry rafah authority news show agreement unclear commander hepatitis daniel immediate amman thousand evacuation adequate unsanitary battle white surrender epidemic literally infection security community briefing call area civilian assistance,-0.99745,0.3898635477582845,10.64779516358464,0.3607719055635723,0,2023-12-07
Washington Post,‘Oppenheimer’ to show in Japan in 2024 after months of controversy,2023-12-07 08:21:00,not specified,"“Oppenheimer,” the biopic about the scientist at the center of the U.S. effort to develop the atomic bomb, will be released in Japan next year, after months of controversy and pushback in the country.Many critics said the film, which was released in the United States and other countries in July, underplayed the devastating impact of the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945, which killed as many as 210,000 people by some estimates.“Oppenheimer” was a hit in box offices worldwide, and in Asian markets, including South Korea and China. But a release date in Japan was never confirmed, sparking speculation that it might never be shown in the country.Bitters End, the movie’s distributor in Japan, said in a statement that the movie’s subject “is of great importance and holds special meaning for Japanese people,” according to Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun. The company said it decided to release the movie in the country in 2024 after “various discussions and considerations,” though it did not provide an exact release date.“Christopher Nolan’s impressive direction and traditional cinematic techniques made the film a unique viewing experience, and we believe everyone should share that experience on a big screen,” Bitters End said in the statement. Bitters End did not immediately respond to a request for further comment Thursday.Nolan previously told Variety that he decided not to show the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the movie because “the film presents Oppenheimer’s experience subjectively” and that he wanted to “rigidly stick to that.” Nolan told the magazine that “Oppenheimer heard about the bombing at the same time that the rest of the world did” and that he “wanted to show somebody who is starting to gain a clearer picture of the unintended consequences of his actions.”Critics, which included anti-nuclear groups, said “Oppenheimer” failed to give a voice to the Japanese people who suffered from the atomic bombings, as well as residents of New Mexico who lived near the bomb’s test site and who continue to suffer the health consequences of presumed radiation exposure decades later.“Oppenheimer” was released on the same day as Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie”; many referred to the joint release of the contrasting movies as “Barbenheimer.” Amid the buzz around both films, Warner Bros., which produced “Barbie,” was called out by its Japanese office after it interacted with social media posts overlaying Barbie with nuclear imagery from “Oppenheimer.”",2501,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/oppenheimer-japan-release/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country japanese barbie heard underplayed worldwide speculation clearer respond refer social japan share importance continue kill request christopher imagery make develop special mexico buzz discussion fail july movie atomic joint impressive newspaper direction asahi united korea view believe rigidly effort china consideration unique exposure biopic company overlay month date start interact comment day group traditional amid told decade release critic greta state consequence gerwig nolan medium film present big presume technique devastate destruction decide pushback accord live include controversy radiation screen experience stick scientist contrast impact bombing previously give bomb produce world suffer bitter health variety box hold time oppenheimer subject statement hit market site office asian voice test spark confirm provide center show shimbun meaning hiroshima picture year immediately exact resident nuclear subjectively distributor post magazine south warner nagasaki great call cinematic rest unintended,-0.44785,0.3598560575769692,10.544721030042918,0.3384133543224452,0,2023-12-07

New York Times,Girl Kills Schoolmate and Wounds 5 Others in Russia Shooting,2023-12-07 06:37:00,Reuters,"Reporting from MoscowA 14-year-old girl shot and killed a schoolmate and wounded five other children on Thursday before killing herself at a school in the western Russian city of Bryansk, officials said.“According to preliminary investigation data, a 14-year-old girl brought a pump-action shotgun to school, from which she fired shots at her classmates,” Russia’s Investigative Committee, the country’s equivalent to the F.B.I., said in a statement.Investigators were working to establish the motive, it said.The regional governor of the Bryansk region, Aleksandr V. Bogomaz, called the shootings a “terrible tragedy” and said the wounded children had sustained mild or moderate injuries.Guns are normally tightly controlled in Russia, but Bryansk is one of several regions that have seen cross-border attacks in the course of the war with Ukraine, and where Moscow has encouraged the formation of self-defense units.Advertisement“Together with law enforcement agencies, we are determining the circumstances under which the student was able to obtain and bring a weapon to school,” Mr. Bogomaz said.Russia has seen several school shootings in recent years.In 2018, an 18-year-old student killed 20 people, mostly fellow pupils, in a mass shooting at a college in Russian-occupied Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.In September last year, a gunman with a swastika on his T-shirt killed 15 people, including 11 children, and wounded 24 at a school in Izhevsk where he had once been a pupil, and then died by suicide, investigators said.Advertisement",1563,https://www.nytimes.com//2023/12/07/world/europe/bryansk-russia-shooting.html,"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/12/07/multimedia/07russia-school-02-cwjv/07russia-school-02-cwjv-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/12/07/multimedia/07russia-school-02-cwjv/07russia-school-02-cwjv-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/12/07/multimedia/07russia-school-02-cwjv/07russia-school-02-cwjv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp 2048w",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jVot1lhu9PmkBYqVP_y4QAHaGg&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,motive gunman fire official obtain establish shooting child work seize investigative control attack mass encourage fellow izhevsk schoolmate wound investigator course tragedy preliminary shot reporting investigation girl weapon moscowa september bogomaz city school formation year russia sustain committee accord moscow shoot agency enforcement country kill crimea terrible circumstance pupil determine equivalent bring moderate include recent college swastika call mild classmate region western law suicide tightly data governor brought student aleksandr bryansk ukraine thursday shotgun russian regional,-0.98295,0.7677543186180422,13.011259259259258,0.2688988095238095,0,2023-12-07

CNN,‘The dead can’t hear your apologies:’ Boris Johnson heckled as he attempts to say sorry for Covid deaths,2023-12-07 05:10:00,Luke McGee,"Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has attempted to apologize for the thousands of lives lost to Covid-19 while he was in power, but was interrupted by protesters as he tried to do so.Johnson was giving evidence on Wednesday morning at the United Kingdom’s public Covid inquiry, which the former leader set up in May 2021.During his opening statement, Johnson was heckled by demonstrators believed to be from a group of families who lost loved ones during the pandemic.Four people stood up when Johnson began to say he was sorry, holding signs reading “the dead can’t hear your apologies,” the UK’s PA Media news agency reported. The protesters were then ejected from the hearing by the inquiry chair Heather Hallet.One of them, 59-year-old Kathryn Butcher, later told the agency: “We didn’t want his apology. When he tried to apologize we stood up. We didn’t block anybody. We were told to sit down.”Butcher, who is from London, told PA Media that her 56-year-old sister-in-law, Myrna Saunders, died from Covid-19 in March 2020, adding that Johnson saw the demonstrators’ signs during the protest.More than 200,000 people were killed by the coronavirus during the pandemic in the UK, one of the highest death tolls in Europe, and Johnson’s government was widely criticized for its response.“I understand the feelings of these victims and their families, and I am deeply sorry for the pain and the loss and suffering of those victims and their families,” Johnson said.“I do hope that this inquiry will help to get the answers to the very difficult questions that those victims in those families are rightly asking,” the former prime minister continued in his opening remarks.Despite opening with an apology, Johnson would not be drawn on specific errors that he considered himself or his government to have made.He went on to defend his actions during the pandemic by saying: “I think we were doing our best at the time, given what we knew, given the information I had available to me at the time.” He continued: “Were there things that we should have done differently? Unquestionably.”Johnson’s conduct during this period has been under intense scrutiny due to the evidence given by others to the inquiry, suggesting that his government permitted a culture that prohibited the right decisions being made.The inquiry is currently examining how Johnson and his senior team reached decisions such as implementing lockdowns and why specific choices were taken at specific times. Johnson’s evidence to the inquiry has already attracted negative headlines as WhatsApp messages requested from his personal phone could not be given to the inquiry due to what he claims is a technical issue.Some of Johnson’s most senior former aides have suggested that Johnson was “bamboozled” by the science as it was presented to him, while his former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been vocally critical of Johnson’s management style, comparing him to an out-of-control shopping trolley.When asked if he thought it was unusual for advisers and officials to be as critical of a leader as they were of Johnson during the pandemic – including on the question of his own competence – the former PM replied: “No I think this is wholly to be expected”While still in office, Johnson became the first sitting prime minister to receive a fine from the police, for breaking his own Covid lockdown rules. The “Partygate” scandal, during which members of his team – and the then-prime minister himself – attended events that breached the national Covid rules played a large part in Johnson losing the support of his governing Conservative Party and ending his time in office.CNN’s Jessie Gretener contributed to this report.",3707,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/europe/boris-johnson-covid-gbr-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206103954-01-boris-johnson-covid-19-hearing-grab.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,aide love coronavirus saunders official differently stood senior receive team demonstrator add reading morning medium agency unusual government inquiry protester hope suggest decision power consider prohibit bamboozle break widely hearing partygate drawn style office boris conduct myrna party national support wholly whatsapp adviser johnson science culture lockdown specific personal large sorry public shopping gretener europe message opening question loss jessie contribute set lose life include heckle present statement former criticize answer group suffer fine police heather vocally dead information toll breach cummings error hear currently action united expect minister chair high covid sign negative reach part news apology kathryn block london attract kill deeply apologize available intense thousand eject due attend begin claim govern time wednesday critical victim defend give report uk competence attempt reply compare evidence examine knew continued death permit march pandemic british interrupt butcher kingdom scandal played choice prime pm management believe event conservative headline technical chief dominic hold request difficult pain family period rule understand rightly leader feeling implement told member scrutiny phone,-0.9855,0.2427839223091448,10.308289855072465,0.4166020671834626,0,2023-12-07
ABC,Former UK leader Boris Johnson returns for second day of COVID-19 inquiry testimony,2023-12-07 05:08:00,DANICA KIRKA Associated Press,"LONDON -- Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday rejected suggestions that he wanted to let COVID-19 “rip” through the population as he defended his handling of the pandemic during a second day of testimony at a public inquiry into the crisis.Johnson shook his head and responded “No, no, no” as he was confronted with a series of diary entries by his chief scientific adviser that indicated he had argued in favor of letting the virus spread rapidly to increase immunity to COVID-19 rather than imposing further restrictions on the people of Britain.The former prime minister, who is testifying under oath, said he was simply pushing scientists to explain why such a strategy wouldn’t work as the government debated whether to impose a second national lockdown in the autumn of 2020 when infection rates were rising and vaccines weren’t yet available. Johnson said critics should look at his public statements and actions, rather than “people’s jottings from meetings that I have been in” when they assess the government’s response to the pandemic.“I think, frankly, it does not do justice to what we did — our thoughts, our feelings, my thoughts, my feelings — to say that we were remotely reconciled to fatalities across the country, or that I believed that it was acceptable to let it rip,” a frustrated Johnson said under questioning from the inquiry’s chief legal counsel, Hugo Keith.Johnson’s government implemented a series of less draconian measures including a 10 p.m. curfew, work from home advice and regionally targeted restrictions in September and October of 2020 before it finally imposed a second national lockdown on Oct. 31.Johnson defended his efforts to balance the health and economic impacts of COVID-19. He was grilled about his government's “Eat Out to Help Out” program, which supported the hospitality industry by subsidizing restaurant meals, and delays in imposing a second national lockdown as infection rates began to rise toward the end of 2020.Leading scientists have testified that they weren't part of the discussions on the program and that it was obvious it would increase transmission risks. Johnson said he had no reason to question the restaurant initiative.“I must emphasize, it was not at the time presented to me as something that would add to the budget of risk,” he said.His remarks came after weeks of testimony by other ministers, including former Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who said they sought to raise the alarm inside the government. Hancock argued that thousands of lives could have been saved by putting the country under a lockdown a few weeks earlier than the eventual date of March 23, 2020.The United Kingdom went on to have one of Europe’s longest and strictest lockdowns, as well as one of the continent’s highest COVID-19 death tolls, with the virus recorded as a cause of death for more than 232,000 people.The inquiry is designed to uncover the lessons of COVID-19 to help officials better respond to future pandemics, but its revelations could further tarnish Johnson’s battered reputation.",3074,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/former-uk-leader-boris-johnson-returns-day-covid-105449997,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/6aa8081c-3327-4f65-992a-415142ec3f9d/wirestory_443f79b1391c18b705e303ad2ee2e8aa_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,delay continent official advice rip work action reconcile eventual united remotely minister suggestion impact date frankly high program reject day september favor add record increase reason critic part restriction london shook government fatality inquiry obvious draconian restaurant alarm handle strictest reputation home available justice scientific impose meal industry thousand earlier budget long argue remark curfew meeting transmission begin boris simply week time response entry defend frustrate discussion save testify national measure support infection testimony rise lesson adviser explain johnson effort regionally target spread risk future head population rapidly grill secretary balance lockdown death indicate diary legal uncover inside march hospitality public counsel pandemic british scientist series ass finally europe kingdom revelation country subsidize confront strategy prime question believe emphasize hancock life hugo include present virus chief rate statement debate former autumn eat batter october oath vaccine jotting acceptable economic respond feeling put raise matt push immunity health implement design tarnish thursday toll sought,-0.86445,0.1951854261548471,10.94645276292335,0.2448979591836735,0,2023-12-07
ABC,Chinese navy ships are first to dock at new pier at Cambodian naval base,2023-12-07 05:00:00,SOPHENG CHEANG Associated Press,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Chinese naval vessels have become the first ships to dock at a new pier at a Cambodian naval base that the United States and some international security analysts say is destined to serve as a strategic outpost for Beijing’s navy.The docking of the two ships, which received little publicity, coincided with an official visit to Cambodia this week by China’s top defense official, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission He Weidong.News of at least two Chinese ships docking at the Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand came out indirectly, through a Facebook post on Sunday by Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Seiha. It said he visited the base to see preparations for Cambodian navy training and to inspect progress on infrastructure construction, but did not mention China by name.He also posted photos showing Cambodian officials with Chinese Ambassador Wang Wentian, and reviewing Chinese sailors. At least two warships could be seen in the photos, one whose gangway identified it as the Chinese navy corvette Wenshan.Satellite photos taken Sunday by Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show what appear to be two Chinese warships docked at the base. They correspond to the images shared online by Tea Seiha.The AP analysis, comparing the ship’s measurements and the images released by the minister, suggest they may both be Type 56 Chinese corvettes.Controversy over Ream Naval Base initially arose in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of a reputed agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.Cambodia’s then-Prime Minister Hun Sen denied there was such an agreement. He pointed out that Cambodia’s constitution does not allow foreign military bases to be established on its soil, but said visiting ships from all nations are welcome.The base is situated on the Gulf of Thailand, adjacent to the South China Sea, where China has aggressively asserted its claim to virtually the entire strategic waterway. The U.S. has refused to recognize China’s sweeping claim and routinely conducts military maneuvers there to reinforce that they are international waters.A Chinese base in Cambodia could become a chokepoint in the Gulf of Thailand close to the strategically important Malacca Strait.Basing rights in Cambodia would extend Beijing’s strategic military profile considerably, and tilt the regional balance of power in a way that would pressure adjacent Southeast Asian countries whose security concerns traditionally have been aligned more closely with the United States.Washington has repeatedly made known its concerns about the base’s intended use. When China and Cambodia broke ground on its naval port expansion project in June last year, the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh reiterated Washington's position that a Chinese “military presence at Ream could threaten Cambodia’s autonomy and undermine regional security.”“The U.S. and countries in the region have expressed concern about the lack of transparency on the intent, nature, and scope of this project as well as the role the PRC (Chinese) military is playing in its construction and in post-construction use of the facility,” said an embassy statement sent to the AP.China is Cambodia’s biggest investor and closest political partner. Beijing’s support allows Cambodia to disregard Western concerns about its poor record in human and political rights, and in turn Cambodia generally supports Beijing’s geopolitical positions on issues such as its territorial claims in the South China Sea.Prime Minister Hun Manet, who succeeded his father Hun Sen in the leadership position earlier this year, said in a post Monday on the Telegram messaging platform that he and China’s visiting official He discussed the continuation of military cooperation through agreements between their respective defense ministries on human resource training and demining operations.Hun Manet also recalled how, when he was serving as Cambodia’s army commander, he took the initiative to strengthen cooperation between the two countries’ armed forces, collaborating on a memorandum of understanding that led to improving unit-to-unit relationships and training exchanges that enhanced the ability of the Cambodian army.Hun Manet’s first official trip abroad after becoming prime minister was to Beijing, reflecting his country’s warm relations with China.——-",4487,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chinese-navy-ships-dock-new-pier-cambodian-naval-105449899,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/20074bab-4667-4eb2-b268-69528627e8fe/wirestory_25fd5ba4af472ec96c68108ea0371c11_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,china personnel enhance intent official wall phnom central issue vessel threaten tea exchange extend agreement ambassador publicity type reflect intend recall store prc arm receive street asian infrastructure reiterate tilt adjacent thailand express relation inspect abroad undermine resource suggest profile power chairman entire monday region assert cambodian role aggressively pier wentian week closely conduct regional analyst nation support defense establish continuation vice facebook lab trip pressure geopolitical important dock recognize balance memorandum international expansion relationship weapon ability pbc repute repeatedly arose associate platform beijing force malacca ground transparency message country photo online corvette considerably strategically partner statement leadership sailor political naval western southeast security chinese ministry align washington post chokepoint disregard gangway lead navy poor military identify routinely visit project closest sweep commission mention wang press berth coincide waterway play human demining image draft virtually concern united commander minister collaborate strengthen initially soil south turn initiative facility outpost foreign serve record sunday review nature deny generally discuss maneuver cambodia reinforce ship telegram gulf progress state autonomy early investor warm training earlier construction make destine refuse territorial close claim traditionally journal share report docked ream release penh show seiha measurement compare constitution analysis preparation analyze warship port year broke manet base scope prime planet succeed presence father strategic respective cooperation top correspond situate understand indirectly position embassy lack june big army improve point,0.93525,0.0,13.082928104575164,0.3600471932439147,0,2023-12-07

Anas Baba/NPR hide caption A boy in Rafah, Gaza, holds a leaflet dropped by an Israeli aircraft that advises residents to stay sheltered ahead of planned airstrikes. TEL AVIV, Israel — Nearly 1.9 million Palestinians have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip in two months of war between Israel and Hamas, according to the United Nations. That's 85% of the population in the besieged enclave. They are being squeezed into smaller and smaller areas — as Israel urges Palestinians to escape its air-and-ground campaign, which has left more than 16,000 dead in Gaza, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory. The U.S. demanded Israel declare safe zones to minimize civilian casualties from Israeli airstrikes in response to the surprise Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. But Palestinians and international aid groups say those zones have been inadequate, and provide no guaranteed shelter to residents who escape. ""There is no 'safe' zone, the entire Gaza Strip has become one of the most dangerous places in the world,"" the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. Israel's former attorney general, Avihai Mandelblit, says he thinks Israel's intention is to ensure civilians escape harm's way, despite the humanitarian crisis associated with urging mass evacuations to Gaza's south. ""I'm not saying it is nice being there, but the only thing that we try to do is to protect their lives. If they're going to stay in Khan Younis in such an intensity of combat, then lots of civilian lives will be lost. The most important thing — that they will not die,"" Mandelblit said, referring to Gaza's second-largest city where Israel's bombardment is focused now. Here is how Israel is notifying Gaza residents to flee — and a glimpse at the confusion, chaos and mass displacement that have resulted. This screenshot of an online ""evacuation zone map"" of the Gaza Strip provided by the Israel Defense Forces shows parts of southern Gaza, including Khan Younis and Rafah. Israel Defense Forces/Screenshot by NPR hide caption This screenshot of an online ""evacuation zone map"" of the Gaza Strip provided by the Israel Defense Forces shows parts of southern Gaza, including Khan Younis and Rafah. As fighting resumed in Gaza last week after a temporary pause, the Israeli military issued a statement saying that it was ""providing information to residents of the Gaza Strip on movement for their safety in the next stage of the war."" ""This divides the territory of the Gaza Strip ... according to recognizable areas to enable the residents of Gaza to orient themselves and understand the instructions, and to evacuate from specific places for their safety, if required,"" the statement said. It then included a link to an Israeli army website in Arabic, featuring what Israel said was an interactive ""Evacuation Zone Map."" The map came about as a result of the Biden administration's insistence that Israel minimize civilian casualties. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after a visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank, called on Israel to declare designated safe zones. An evacuated woman with belongings in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Tuesday. Anas Baba for NPR hide caption An evacuated woman with belongings in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Tuesday. But the map proved difficult to navigate on computers and the cellphones that most Palestinians use. Residents are asked to locate their neighborhood on a numbered grid, memorize its zone number and then ""track and follow the instructions of the [Israeli military] through various media outlets and obey them."" Many residents in Gaza have little electricity or internet service, making it difficult to access the map. And those who have identified their zone according to the map have received mixed messages from both the Israeli military and other residents about whether their zone had been ordered to evacuate. Heba Usrof, who is from Khan Younis, where heavy fighting is taking place, tells NPR she looked at the map Israel provided and her zone was not listed for evacuation. ""My house was in zone 55. The last zone on the evacuation list was 54,"" says 29-year-old Usrof. ""Right after the truce was over, they hit right next to our house,"" Usrof says. ""They hit again the following day,"" she says. ""An Israeli soldier contacted our neighbor, instructing him to evacuate and tell everyone else to do the same."" So Usrof moved south to Rafah, near the border with Egypt, where she says she's now sharing an apartment with 60 other people. The Israeli military said Hamas on Wednesday fired rockets toward Israel from rocket launchers near tents where civilians were sheltering in Rafah. ""The Hamas terrorist organization abuses the people of Gaza, utilizing them for its acts of terror. Hamas cynically embeds itself in civilian infrastructure, schools, residential areas, near United Nations facilities and even in humanitarian zones — using the civilians as a human shield,"" the military said in a statement. #عاجل سكان قطاع غزة، جيش الدفاع يعمل بقوة ضد حماس والمنظمات الإرهابية في قطاع غزة وبشكل خاص في منطقة خان يونس. فيما يلي عدة تعليمات عاجلة: ⭕️القتال والتقدم العسكري لجيش الدفاع في منطقة خان يونس لا يسمحان بتنقل المدنيين عبر محور صلاح الدين في المقاطع الواقعة شمالي وشرقي مدينة… pic.twitter.com/nKC6YoEXG5 Israeli military Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee has been posting information — along with videos aimed at persuading Palestinian viewers that Hamas was responsible for their suffering in the war — on X and Facebook since the war began, instructing civilians to flee. In this post on X on Tuesday, he said the military was operating in the Khan Younis area, and warned that a main north-south road was a combat zone. He said Israeli forces would suspend military activities in a neighborhood of Rafah until 2 p.m. Adraee's first announcement declaring a safe passage out of northern Gaza in early November was followed by another announcement the following day: The safe passage was rendered unsafe by Hamas gunfire, he said. Many Palestinians in Gaza say they have been following Adraee's Arabic-language announcements to try to make sense of Israel's changing directives.

Israeli warplanes are also dropping flyers on neighborhoods, with directions to either flee or seek shelter. This isn't the first time residents of Gaza have experienced this kind of warning — in 2014, a similar tactic was used ahead of an Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip from the north and again in 2021. Mustafa, who only gave his first name because he was criticizing Hamas and feared retaliation, fled with his family and their belongings, from northern Gaza to Khan Younis 20 days ago, and then to Rafah on Tuesday. ""The Israelis told us to go south. We came here and found no place to go. We are all in the streets,"" he told NPR. ""Hamas should have secured the people, before doing this. They should have secured the people, and secured a place for the people."" His young son held up a flier that had rained down on them earlier in the week.

NPR,What North Korea's shift toward Russia means for its global strategy,2023-12-07 05:00:00,Anthony Kuhn,"That is hardly surprising, as Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly stated that his country was willing to help North Korea with its satellites, when leader Kim Jong Un visited the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia's far east in September. But that's not the whole picture. South Korea's military also believes that North Korea may have sent over a million artillery shells and other munitions to Russia for use in Ukraine. And so by repaying North Korea's munitions with technical assistance, the two neighbors may have completed the first major transaction of a new phase in relations between the government in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and Moscow, which some analysts see as part of a major strategic shift in North Korea's foreign relations. Following the collapse of nuclear negotiations with the United States in 2019, Pyongyang has made it increasingly ""clear that they're not going to negotiate their nuclear weapons away,"" says Lee Ho-ryung, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, a government think tank in Seoul. ""And that means they need someone else — a third country, not the U.S. — to help them develop,"" she says. ""To them, it was Russia."" This comes despite North Korea's mutual defense commitments with China, its largest trading partner. Analysts and defectors say Pyongyang is wary of becoming too reliant on Beijing. Last month in North Korea, the fourth Russian delegation to visit Pyongyang since July discussed with their hosts joint prospecting for gold, iron and rare earths, exporting Russian meat and grain, and plans for a Russian ballet troupe to perform in Pyongyang.

While it's not clear whether any of this cooperation might violate international sanctions on North Korea, what is clear is that the diplomatic and economic pas de deux between Pyongyang and Moscow is burgeoning. Politically, analysts say, Pyongyang is increasingly trying to position itself as a key player in an emerging anti-U.S. bloc led by China and Russia, whose leaders last year declared their relationship a ""no-limits"" partnership and have stepped up military drills in Asia and beyond. North Korea has voiced its support for Russia's war in Ukraine, and for years backed Hamas, Iran, China and Cuba in their confrontations with the U.S. Shortly after his summit with Putin, Kim urged his country's diplomats to ""further promote solidarity with the nations standing against the U.S. and the West's strategy for hegemony."" At the same time, though, Pyongyang has been closing embassies in certain countries. Since October, nine either have closed or are scheduled to close. Lee, the researcher in Seoul, argues that these closures are occurring as North Korea is focusing limited resources on building ties with and opening missions in anti-U.S. countries such as Nicaragua. Pyongyang has assailed increasing trilateral cooperation among the U.S., South Korea and Japan, using what it sees as a U.S. attempt to form an ""Asian version of NATO"" as justification for tightening its own ties with Russia and China. North Korea has ""defined the future global and regional order as a new Cold War,"" says Lee. ""And they stress this three-versus-three new Cold War structure ... because that structure is advantageous for North Korea in the short term to create strategic space,"" she says. Seen from another angle, international events have helped catalyze North Korea's strategic shift. ""The war between Russia and Ukraine and the intensifying competition between the U.S. and China opened up the possibilities for cooperation with China and Russia,"" says Park Hyeong-jung, a researcher emeritus at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a South Korean government think tank. ""So this is, for North Korea, a kind of coincidental salvation,"" Park says. North Korea needed to shift to a new strategy because its previous one — of trying to bargain away part of its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for sanctions relief and normalized ties with the U.S. — fell apart. To think it could succeed in the first place was a failure of Kim's strategic judgment, Park says. Then again, Kim saw a rare alignment of positive factors and tried to capitalize on it. ""North Korea comes out to the negotiating table only when the frame of negotiations is favorable to them,"" Park says, ""and the Moon-Trump-Kim era was just that."" (Moon Jae-in, who favored engagement with Pyongyang, was South Korea's president at the time). Following an initial summit with then-President Donald Trump in Singapore in 2018, Kim ""really thought he could make progress with the Americans,"" says Robert Carlin, a visiting scholar at Stanford University and former State Department official. But when Trump walked out of a 2019 summit in Vietnam, after rejecting Kim's offer of partial denuclearization in exchange for lifting sanctions, it ""was an enormous blow to Kim,"" says Carlin, ""both personally and as a symbol of his office, and the aura of his leadership."" Clues to Kim's thinking can be seen in a series of 27 letters Kim and Trump exchanged in 2018 and 2019. Trump showed the letters to journalist Bob Woodward. In his final letter to Trump in August 2019, Kim wrote: ""If you do not think of our relationship as a stepping stone that only benefits you, then you would not make me look like an idiot that will only give without getting anything in return."" This pool image distributed by Sputnik agency shows North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia on Sept. 13. Vladimir Smirnov/Pool/AFP via Getty Images hide caption This pool image distributed by Sputnik agency shows North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia on Sept. 13. The letter illustrates how Kim ""thought he had been double-crossed,"" Carlin says. ""And as far as they were concerned, that's it. You can't deal with the Americans."" Analysts are not sure, though, that Kim can get everything he wants from Moscow and Beijing, either. Researcher Lee argues that China is wary of getting so close to Russia and North Korea that it invites an even tighter grouping of the U.S., South Korea and Japan, which could threaten Beijing. And if things go badly for Russia in Ukraine, Pyongyang could suffer a repeat of what happened after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, when a drop in aid contributed to a famine in North Korea that killed up to 3.5 million people.

ABC,"Azerbaijan to hold snap presidential election, shortly before Russia's vote",2023-12-07 04:49:00,The Associated Press,"President Ilham Aliyev has ordered Azerbaijan’s Central Election Commission to prepare for an early presidential election on Feb. 7, shortly ahead of Russia’s presidential election on March 17.The order was published on the presidential website but did not explain why Aliyev had called an early vote. The next presidential election had been scheduled to be held in 2025.Aliyev's popularity in Azerbaijan has recently increased after the government took full control of the Karabakh region following a lightning rout of ethnic Armenian forces.In November, he presided over a military parade through Khankendi, the capital of the Karabakh region, telling spectators that ""we showed the whole world the strength, determination and indomitable spirit of the Azerbaijani people.”Khankendi, which Armenians called Stepanakert, was the headquarters of the self-declared separatist government of Nagorno-Karabakh. The region and sizable surrounding territory came under control of ethnic Armenians in 1994 at the end of a separatist war.But Azerbaijan regained parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and most of the surrounding territory in 2020 after a six-week war. That fighting ended with a Russia-brokered truce between Azerbaijan and Armenia that called for Russian peacekeeping forces to be deployed in the Khankendi area and to ensure open transit along a road connecting the city with Armenia.However, Azerbaijan began blockading that road last winter, leading to severe food and medicine shortages in the Armenian-held area. Then in September it launched a blitz that forced the separatist forces to disband.More than 100,000 ethnic Armenians fled the region in the following days, leaving the city nearly deserted and under the control of Azerbaijan.",1741,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/azerbaijan-hold-snap-presidential-election-february-7-shortly-105449807,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/4a29e3a4-9223-4de9-9b73-2c8ce525370a/wirestory_999b469c0c47373ff2f4eb4262e7efb5_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,rout full prepare separatist winter spirit commission world central presidential truce control desert follow explain publish flee show order strength president azerbaijani shortage azerbaijan held september day march open road determination increase force russia surround spectator armenia part leave schedule government blitz food launch fight november peacekeeping aliyev shortly website headquarters lightning deployed election preside indomitable medicine call early region capital transit blockading karabakh ensure severe popularity regain area ethnic armenian lead ilham khankendi stepanakert military vote begin parade sizable connect ahead recently territory russian city,0.83415,0.0,14.747330960854091,0.2868421052631579,0,2023-12-07
ABC,Strikes on Gaza's southern edge sow fear in one of the last areas to which people can flee,2023-12-07 04:39:00,NAJIB JOBAIN Associated Press and KAREEM CHEHAYEB Associated Press,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip -- Israeli forces struck the southern Gaza town of Rafah twice overnight, residents said Thursday, sowing fear in one of the last places where civilians could seek refuge after Israel widened its offensive against Hamas to areas already packed with displaced people.United Nations officials say there are no safe places in Gaza. Heavy fighting in and around the southern city of Khan Younis has displaced tens of thousands of people in a territory where over 80% of the population has already fled their homes, and cut most of Gaza off from deliveries of food, water and other vital aid.Two months into the war, the grinding offensive has set off renewed alarms internationally, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres using a rarely exercised power to warn the Security Council of an impending “humanitarian catastrophe” and urging members to demand a cease-fire.The United States has called on Israel to limit civilian deaths and displacement, saying too many Palestinians were killed when it obliterated much of Gaza City and the north. But it has also pledged unwavering support for Israel and appears likely to block any such U.N. effort to halt the fighting.Israel says it must crush Hamas' military capabilities and remove it from power following the Oct. 7 attack that ignited the war. Troops have pushed into Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which Israeli officials have portrayed as Hamas' center of gravity — something they previously said was in Gaza City and its Shifa Hospital.Israel has ordered the evacuation of some two dozen southern neighborhoods, rather than the entire region as it did in the north, which the military says shows increased concern for civilians.But the areas where Palestinians can seek safety are rapidly receding. With northern and central Gaza largely isolated and cut off from aid, Palestinians are heading south to Rafah and other areas along the border with Egypt, where family homes are packed tight and makeshift shelters are overflowing.Even there, safety has proven elusive, as Israel continues to strike what it says are Hamas targets across the coastal enclave.A strike late Wednesday leveled a home in Rafah, sending a wave of wounded streaming into a nearby hospital. Eyad al-Hobi, who witnessed the attack, said around 20 people were killed, including women and children. Another house was hit early Thursday, residents said.“We live in fear every moment, for our children, ourselves, our families,” said Dalia Abu Samhadaneh, now living in Rafah with her family after fleeing Khan Younis. “We live with the anxiety of expulsion.”The military meanwhile accused militants of firing rockets from open areas near Rafah in the humanitarian zone. It released footage of a strike Wednesday on what it said were launchers positioned outside the town and a few hundred meters (yards) from a U.N. warehouse.The U.N. says some 1.87 million people — over 80% of the population of 2.3 million — have already fled their homes, many of them displaced multiple times.Israel's campaign has killed more than 16,200 people in Gaza — most of them women and children — and wounded more than 42,000, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which says many others are trapped under rubble. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.Doctors Without Borders, the international aid group, said another 115 bodies arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah in a 24-hour period.“The hospital is full, the morgue is full,” the group said on X, formerly known as Twitter.The military said Thursday that it struck dozens of militant targets in Khan Younis, including a tunnel shaft from which fighters had launched an attack. It said two of the attackers were killed.Hamas and other militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war, and took some 240 people hostage. An estimated 138 hostages remain in Gaza, mostly soldiers and civilian men, after 105 were freed during a cease-fire in late November.A built-up refugee camp inside Khan Younis was the childhood home of Hamas’ top leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, and the group’s military chief, Mohammed Deif, as well as other Hamas leaders — though their current whereabouts are unknown.Heavy fighting is also still underway in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, even after two months of heavy bombardment and encirclement by ground troops. The military said troops raided a militant compound, killing “a number” of fighters and uncovering a network of tunnels.It was not immediately possible to confirm the latest reports from the battlefield.Israel blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas, accusing it of using civilians as human shields when the militants operate in residential areas. But Israel has not given detailed accounts of its individual strikes, some of which have leveled entire city blocks.The military says 87 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. It also says some 5,000 militants have been killed, without saying how it arrived at its count.Tens of thousands of people have fled from Khan Younis and other areas to Rafah, on Gaza's southern border with Egypt, the U.N. said. Rafah, normally home to around 280,000 people, is already hosting more than 470,000 who fled from other parts of Gaza.On the other side of the border, Egypt has deployed thousands of troops and erected earthen barriers to prevent any mass influx of refugees. It says an influx would undermine its decades-old peace treaty with Israel, and it doubts Israel will let them back into Gaza.For days now, aid groups have only been able to distribute supplies in and around Rafah, and mainly just flour and water, the U.N.’s humanitarian aid office said. Access farther north has been cut off by fighting and Israeli forces closing roads.The World Food Program said a “catastrophic hunger crisis” threatens to ""overwhelm the civilian population.”Gaza has been without electricity since the first week of the war, and hospitals and water treatment plants have been forced to shut down for lack of fuel to operate generators. Israel allows a trickle of aid from Egypt but has greatly restricted imports of fuel, saying Hamas diverts it for military purposes.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that Israel would allow small deliveries of fuel into the southern Gaza Strip “from time to time” to prevent the spread of disease. The “minimal amount” of fuel will be set by the war cabinet, he said.___This story has been corrected to show that the Israeli military says 87 of its soldiers have been killed during the Gaza ground offensive, not 88.___Chehayeb reported from Beirut.___",6741,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/strikes-gazas-southern-edge-sow-fear-areas-people-105449715,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d6796764-0307-40c8-9e89-bc8ade0f76f9/wirestory_174f470c9e3d3c6ea5adb59d7e523425_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month samhadaneh antonio fire official bombardment central tunnel witness send minimal unwavering live attack follow mass guterres hamas order warn detailed elusive mohammed trigger woman encirclement prevent aid gravity increase shelter packed trickle operate fight threatens undermine makeshift displace delivery moment power deployed entire demand jabaliya remove shut home call neighborhood younis region abu strip multiple launcher farther rocket wave differentiate childhood dalia host barrier civilian palestinian area north humanitarian resident office accuse week territory network correct town zone stream nation support underway world continue northern widen rubble rarely side target militant impend seek spread overwhelm population international hunger compound inside uncover force possible ground accord refugee camp safety supply halt place erect hundred set exercise include peace israel deir martyr group ministry gaza shifa portrayed security troop arrive renew electricity yehya push health rafah closing small military confirm proven toll meter tight council center displacement living ten formerly hospital estimate generator human cut concern united netanyahu minister current high south house program urge evacuation day city diverts coastal capability water part earthen flour block restrict nearby kill launch alarm trap plant footage state catastrophe grind strike early refuge yard hit thousand egypt safe treaty morgue account pledge dozen crush time wednesday access israeli recede give report full sinwar soldier attacker influx individual southern release x child freed level vital effort obliterate overnight flee show wound shaft hostage head internationally rapidly death blame shield benjamin previously number khan immediately combatant open treatment catastrophic whereabouts campaign food greatly ignite cabinet distribute late amount chief import crisis fuel top back remain anxiety family body largely offensive heavy deif limit isolated eyad sow leader position border residential lack disease fighter member doubt struck million raid story thursday fear,-0.9968,0.6230529595015576,11.312995850622404,0.3334414791557649,0,2023-12-07
ABC,UK leader Rishi Sunak vows to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda despite court saying plan is unlawful,2023-12-07 04:26:00,JILL LAWLESS Associated Press,"LONDON -- British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Thursday he would “do what is necessary” to revive a blocked deal to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda, even if it means ignoring human rights laws.During a hastily scheduled news conference, Sunak vowed to press on with a plan that has roiled the governing Conservative Party and threatened his leadership.He said that a new bill designed to override a U.K. Supreme Court ruling will end “the merry-go-round of legal challenges” that have prevented the government acting on its agreement with Rwanda to put migrants who reach Britain across the English Channel on a one-way trip to the East African country.“We will get flights off the ground,"" Sunak said.Refugee groups and legal experts have strongly criticized the plan as a breach of the U.K.'s human rights commitments. But Sunak's main political threat comes from members of his party who think it is not harsh enough.It escalated when Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick quit the government late Wednesday, saying the government's bill “does not go far enough” and won’t work.The Rwanda plan is central to the U.K. government’s self-imposed goal to keep unauthorized asylum-seekers in small boats from departing France in hopes of reaching England.Britain and Rwanda agreed on a deal in April 2022 under which migrants who cross the Channel would be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be processed and, if successful, they would stay.The U.K. government argues the deportations will discourage others from making the risky sea crossing and break the business model of people-smuggling gangs. Critics say it’s both unethical and unworkable to send migrants to a country 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) away with no chance of ever settling in the U.K.No one has yet been sent to Rwanda under the plan, which has faced multiple legal challenges. Last month, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled the plan was illegal because Rwanda isn’t a safe country for refugees.The government has refused to drop the plan despite the court's judgment. Britain and Rwanda have since signed a treaty pledging to strengthen protections for migrants. Sunak's government says the treaty allows it to pass a law declaring Rwanda a safe destination and to ignore parts of British human rights law to send migrants there.The government says the law will allow it to “disapply” sections of U.K. human rights law when it comes to Rwanda-related asylum claims and make it harder to challenge the deportations in court.Sunak said the bill ""blocks every single reason that has ever been used to prevent flights to Rwanda taking off.”He said that while asylum-seekers would have limited ways to fight deportation, “we have set the bar so high that it will be vanishingly rare for anyone to meet it.”The bill has its first vote scheduled in the House of Commons next week. Lawmakers in the Conservative Party’s authoritarian wing think the bill is too mild and want the U.K. to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Almost every European country, apart from Russia and Belarus, is bound by the convention and its court.Sunak responded to his immigration minister's resignation by arguing that the bill went as far as the government could.“If we were to oust the courts entirely, we would collapse the entire scheme,” he wrote in a letter to Jenrick.Rwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta confirmed that his country would scrap the deal unless Britain stuck to international law.“It has always been important to both Rwanda and the U.K. that our rule of law partnership meets the highest standards of international law, and it places obligations on both the U.K. and Rwanda to act lawfully,” he said in a statement.Sunak has made “stopping the boats” one of his key pledges ahead of a national election that is due next year. He hopes that showing progress will help his Conservatives close a big polling gap with the opposition Labour Party.While the Rwanda plan worries some centrist Conservative lawmakers who oppose Britain breaching its human rights obligations, the bigger danger for Sunak comes from the hard-line right wing represented by Jenrick and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman.Braverman, whom Sunak fired last month after she made a series of statements that deviated from the government line, is seen as likely to run for party leader if the Conservatives lose power in an election. The party contest could come even sooner if Conservative lawmakers think ditching Sunak will improve their chances.Braverman criticized the Rwanda bill and said the law must go farther, including a ban on legal challenges to deportation and incarceration of asylum-seekers in military-style barracks.“We have to totally exclude international law -– the Refugee Convention, other broader avenues of legal challenge,” she said.Braverman did not answer directly when asked if she supported Sunak as prime minister.",4902,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uk-leader-rishi-sunak-faces-conservative-crisis-blocked-105449620,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/63fa809a-9d00-483b-899f-82e40735f43d/wirestory_643f961080057a78ebfc441cc81f0694_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month fire central harder send threaten chance incarceration agreement english stuck totally prevent russia judgment hastily breaching schedule government fight represent hope bound ruling harsh power destination entire belarus vincent home argues break avenue britain multiple farther law authoritarian east plan broader lawmaker argue successful week supreme common challenge party danger national mile oust support ignore partnership lawfully declare disapply vanishingly directly labour unauthorized protection trip obligation important threat standard risky international section unworkable override away act ground channel entirely boat refugee african country bill place process set lose include bar statement former asylum political criticize answer goal group robert illegal put immigration deportation small design single confirm ahead april expert discourage scheme drop breach kilometer rwanda wing press polling european human despite minister strengthen high house key rare sign foreign stop reason critic reach convention conference part collapse agree news block london suella progress france sunak model jenrick oppose safe treaty limited make due deal refuse pledge line close claim meet govern wednesday roil strongly flight scrap vowed write resignation show biruta contest revive gap secretary ditch rishi deviate commitment legal year gang british series settle leave prime run depart late court conservative election worry unethical mild centrist opposition ban exclude rule escalate migrant business respond leader sooner cross quit member letter big vote thursday improve,-0.9424,0.1835985312117503,11.850682080924855,0.3378141807687261,0,2023-12-07
ABC,"Russian schoolgirl shoots several classmates, leaving 1 dead, before killing herself",2023-12-07 04:12:00,The Associated Press,"MOSCOW -- A Russian schoolgirl shot several of her classmates with a gun on Thursday, killing one person and wounding five others before killing herself, state news agencies and authorities said.The shooting happened at a school in Bryansk, a city in a region of the same name that borders Ukraine, Russia’s Investigative Committee said.One of the people wounded was in serious condition, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said.A fellow student told RIA Novosti that the girl brought the gun to the school in a tube for carrying papers. She told the state news agency that when the shooting began, two girls, including the twin sister of the 14-year-old shooter, came running into their classroom.A preliminary investigation found that the assailant had brought a pump-action shotgun to the school that she used to fire at her classmates, Russia’s Investigative Committee said.Video shared by Ria Novosti showed children cowered in a classroom behind a door barricaded with upended desks and chairs.The dead girl's father was taken for questioning as a witness, RIA Novosti said. Investigators wanted to ask him how his daughter came into possession of the gun, the Telegram channel Shot reported.The school's director was also being questioned about how the girl managed to bring the weapon into the school and about the state of the school's security systems, state news agency Tass reported.The presidential children's rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, said on her Telegram channel that she was overseeing the care of the wounded children. In March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Lvova-Belova and Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes, accusing them of responsibility for the abduction of children from Ukraine.Russia’s Interior Ministry said it was looking into a motive for the shooting, which is among several school shootings in the country in recent years.In September 2022, a gunman opened fire in a school in central Russia, killing 17 people and wounding 24 others before shooting himself dead.In April 2022, a man killed two children and a staff member at a kindergarten also in central Russia.In May 2021, a man opened fire at students at his former high school in the Russian city of Kazan, killing nine people including seven children.",2303,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russian-schoolgirl-shoots-classmates-leaving-1-dead-killing-105449530,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,gunman fire desk commissioner issue central witness investigative oversee fellow investigator high shot investigation kazan september school found russia assailant committee agency news barricade tube ria kindergarten kill telegram bring state shooter vladimir responsibility region crime brought happen begin bryansk ukraine accuse russian criminal share motive novosti putin presidential shooting schoolgirl child show wound director president maria preliminary international warrant girl weapon staff authority march open gun shoot moscow twin channel country classroom question sister run father court include person recent possession cower former classmate security ministry upended carry border condition interior abduction student told manage member daughter system dead thursday paper shotgun april arrest city,-0.9875,0.6513243595310465,12.252338308457707,0.1964035087719298,0,2023-12-07
ABC,"Turkish, Greek leaders signal markedly improved ties between the two NATO allies",2023-12-07 04:04:00,DEREK GATOPOULOS Associated Press and ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press,"ATHENS, Greece -- After several years of strained relations that raised tensions to alarming levels, longtime regional rivals Greece and Turkey made a significant step Thursday in mending ties during a visit to Athens by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Ahead of his one-day visit, Erdogan had promised a “win-win” approach that could lay the foundation for broader cooperation, with hopes of also resetting his country's ties with Western allies.“It is natural for there to be problems between two countries, even more so among brothers,” Erdogan said after meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. “The issue is the will to resolve those problems and differences of opinion.”With both leaders showing a marked departure from the testy, sometimes outright belligerent rhetoric of the last few years, Erdogan said of the Aegean Sea through which the two NATO members' border runs: “We want to convert the Aegean into a sea of peace and cooperation. We wish to be an example to the world with the joint steps we will take as Turkey and Greece.”“I say it openly,” Erdogan said, according to a translation of his comments. “There is no problem between us so great that it cannot be resolved, provided we move with good faith and we focus on the big picture.”The longstanding disputes between Greece and Turkey have led the two countries to the brink of war three times in the last 50 years. Centering on maritime boundaries and exploration rights for resources in the Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean, the latest flare-up occurred in 2020, when navy ships from the two countries shadowed each other in the eastern Mediterranean.As relations deteriorated, Erdogan said as recently as last year that he no longer had any interest in meeting with Mitsotakis. But Thursday’s visit will be the third time this year that Erdogan and Mitsotakis have met, signaling a significant push to improve ties.“Our bilateral relations have experienced turbulence that at times have dangerously threatened them, and with them (threatened) security and peace in the Eastern Mediterranean,” Mitsotakis said, addressing the Turkish president as “my dear president,” and “Mr. President, dear Tayyip.”Mitsotakis noted the importance of the “calmer path” that bilateral relations have been on over the past few months. “Greece and Turkey, Turkey and Greece should live in peace, express their known differences, discuss them honestly and keep looking for solutions,"" he said. ""And if these are not resolved, however, they should not automatically produce tensions and crises.”Erdogan was accompanied on his trip by several ministers, with joint Cabinet talks with Greek ministers and the signing of several cooperation agreements on the agenda.The significance of improved relations extends beyond bilateral ties and could help Turkey mend rocky relationships with the European Union and other Western allies. One crucial agreement in Athens focuses on migration, establishing communication channels between the coast guards of the two countries.Mitsotakis also said he is backing holiday visas for Turks visiting Greek islands and is backing Ankara’s request to ease travel restrictions for Turkish nationals in the European Union.Other agreements include deals on trade, energy, education, agriculture, sports, technology and tourism. Mitsotakis said a “realistic target” over the next five years was for bilateral trade, which currently stands at over 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion), to increase to 10 billion euros ($10.8 billion).The intention to work toward improved relations was evident in Erdogan's first meeting of the day, with President Katerina Sakellaropoulou.“We will discuss what steps going forward we can take on all issues after preparations have been made by the relevant ministers. We will proceed in a more logical way,"" Erdogan told the Greek president in televised comments. “I believe it is best for the future of both sides to discuss looking at the glass half-full.”Sakellaropoulou, whose role is largely ceremonial, said disasters in both countries this year, when Turkey was hit by a deadly earthquake and Greece suffered deadly wildfires and floods, brought out sentiments of solidarity between the two nations.“The tragic events that our countries faced this year were an occasion to prove once again that a sense of solidarity and the demonstration of humanity in difficult circumstances is a common characteristic that unites our two peoples,” Sakellaropoulou said. “This finding is a strong basis for building on the mutual political will to establish a climate that will allow deepening cooperation and avoiding tensions in our bilateral relations.”She said it is now “perhaps more necessary than ever for Greece and Turkey to work together to enhance prosperity, to preserve peace, stability and respect for international law, and to promote good neighborly relations for the benefit of both our peoples and the wider region.”",4959,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/turkish-president-erdogan-visits-greece-effort-mend-strained-105449526,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/4048bfc8-6340-413b-af39-9c77ddcafcc1/wirestory_592b9bea916ce5efde70ce179f48e5a2_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month enhance issue threaten work live tie address move agreement intention belligerent trade erdogan mitsotakis increase island ease backing express flood longstanding relation accompany respect hope turkey prove brink resource strong guard solidarity televise region nato relevant law agriculture role broader humanity energy visa sport basis common regional automatically ankara longtime national importance deepen benefit world bilateral establish forward foundation boundary side trip wider target extends convert president eastern technology euro coast focus international relationship solution accord channel characteristic climate tourism country interest evident deadly tragic difference significance include education communication peace stability testy political comment western earthquake security travel suffer calmer raise crucial tension promote outright demonstration push natural navy sentiment lead translation exploration produce visit center find occasion mutual honestly sakellaropoulou tayyip currently european past minister prosperity rival provide approach day mend building resolve mr path wish restriction ship alarm joint recep signing neighborly disaster athens stand brother glass shadow signal experienced hit note migration make deal dear ally dispute brought aegean meeting time greek recently mediterranean turk unites proceed problem strain logical level openly show greece future dangerously union rhetoric marked ceremonial preparation deteriorate year great talk lay significant occur preserve faith prime circumstance run believe event longer cabinet late avoid departure katerina cooperation request difficult rocky step kyriakos largely reset billion realistic holiday leader border turbulence wildfire discus turkish member maritime told big thursday improve promise,0.9941,0.3024803387779795,11.351534154535276,0.3812146892655368,0,2023-12-07
CNN,European leaders are in Beijing with a list of concerns. Will China’s Xi listen?,2023-12-07 03:50:00,Simone McCarthy,"Stakes are high as Chinese leader Xi Jinping hosts European Union leaders in Beijing for a closely watched summit Thursday, which could decide whether the two major economies will be able to resolve deep trade tensions – or see those spiral further.The one-day gathering is the first in-person EU-China summit in four years and follows a terse and frosty virtual event early last year, later described by EU diplomat Josep Borell as a “dialogue of the deaf.”Brussels arrived with a list of key economic grievances its leaders say they need to see addressed to smooth ties with their most important trade partner. Beijing, meanwhile, has been busy trying to shore up relations with its key trading counterparts and foreign companies as it struggles with mounting economic challenges at home.“Standing at a new starting point for China-EU relations, we need to sum up historical experience … demonstrate wisdom and responsibility, and stay committed to the correct positioning of our comprehensive strategic partnership,” Xi told the leaders during a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse Thursday.The two sides should “continuously enhance political mutual trust,” “build strategic consensus,” and “remove all kinds of interference,” he stressed.His words echoed comments from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi earlier in the week, which touted the visit as a chance to “push China-EU relations to a new level with new prospects.”Li Mingjiang, an associate professor of international relations at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, said the priority for Chinese leaders is to stabilize the domestic economy, and Beijing sees the EU as potentially playing a valuable role.“China has strong incentive right now to further improve relations with European countries,” he said.But expectations were low for major breakthroughs, given entrenched points of difference between the two sides, from economic relations to their starkly different positions on Russia’s war against Ukraine, which two years on China has yet to condemn.The meeting comes amid Europe’s broad recalibration of its policy toward China. Earlier this year the bloc began its push to “de-risk” European supply chains from China and secure critical technologies amid rising concerns about Beijing’s global ambitions and economic practices.Visiting leaders European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel and top EU diplomat Josep Borrell signaled ahead of their visit that they were ready to press Xi and Premier Li Qiang on a list of economic concerns.“China is the EU’s most important trading partner. But there are clear imbalances and differences that we must address. We both recognize the importance of de-risking and strengthening the resilience of our economies,” von der Leyen told Xi as their meeting got underway Thursday.In the lead up to the summit, European leaders spoke frankly about their sticking points – and implied that they would take a harder line if progress wasn’t made.Key among those issues is the gaping trade deficit between the EU and China, which Brussels blames on Beijing’s subsidies for Chinese companies and barriers to entry into the Chinese market.Borrell last month in an address to EU ambassadors warned that “if China continues to deny the reality and consequences of this imbalance, it runs the risk of seeing a rising demand in Europe for more protection.”In September, the bloc announced it was launching an investigation into China’s state support for makers of electric vehicles as soaring imports of their cars stoked fears for the future of European auto manufacturers.China has slammed the move as a “protectionist practice,” claiming the rapid growth of its electric vehicle industry is down to “technological innovation, free competition and a complete industrial supply chain.”It’s also pushed back on Europe’s “de-risking,” launching a diplomatic campaign criticizing the policy as illogical and politically motivated, with state-backed media taking aim at von der Leyen in particular for spearheading it.In comments Thursday reported by state media, Xi also made an apparent reference to the policy, telling the visiting leaders: “We should not regard each other as rivals just because we have different systems, reduce cooperation just because there is competition, or engage in confrontation just because we have differences.”Ahead of Beijing’s Thursday’s closely watched summit, analysts said Beijing may be willing to make some gestures toward further opening its market for European investment or addressing the trade deficit, but there were low expectations in Europe for any major progress.“Europeans have come to realize the concrete outcomes will be limited. European officials and corporate people feel that (China’s) ‘open-door’ policy is no longer,” said Philippe Le Corre, a Paris-based senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, referring to perceptions that China is no longer a hospitable place for foreign business.The visiting leaders were expected to reiterate throughout their visit that the “de-risking” policy to diversify supply chains does not mean they wish to decouple their closely connected economies. And both sides are also expected look for areas of collaboration.“Von der Leyen and Michel are keen to maintain (open) lines of communication,” said Le Corre.“(That’s) especially with the unknown result of the 2024 US elections — what if a new Trump administration was to come back with a trade sanctions policy against the EU? What if he was to disengage with NATO?” he said.For Xi, the meeting comes on the heels of a largely friendly summit with American President Joe Biden, where despite tensions the two sides reached significant agreements including on military communication and environmental protection.Improving ties with Europe may be “even more important” for Xi, according to Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute at the University of London. Amid competition with the US, Beijing is keen to not see the EU “side with Washington,” he said.Over the past year, Chinese officials have made multiple diplomatic efforts to repair relations with Europe.But even still, Xi “will not make major concessions to the EU without getting something big in return,” according to Tsang.This month Beijing has appeared to make a goodwill gesture by allowing visa-free travel to passport holders from a handful of European countries including France and Germany. And in comments Thursday, Xi was quoted by state media as saying China was pursuing “high-level opening-up” and was “ready to regard the EU as a key partner in economic and trade cooperation,” though no further details were included.Beijing’s crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong, alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic had already strained ties long before China refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.On Thursday, visiting European leaders had been expected to push Xi to ensure that Chinese firms are not supporting the Russian war effort. Unlike the US, Europe so far has refrained from blacklisting Chinese companies believed to be providing goods that could be used on the battlefield.The two sides were also expected to discuss the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza.Beijing has not condemned Hamas for the October 7 attack on Israel that killed roughly 1,200 people and sparked the latest conflict – setting its stance at odds with Europe and the US. It’s instead focused criticism of Israel’s strikes on the enclave which have killed more than 15,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.Speaking to Xi and other leaders as the meeting began, von der Leyen called for an “end to the Russian aggression against Ukraine” and for all possible efforts to “work for a two-state solution in the Middle East.”“As major powers in the world, the European Union and China have global responsibilities. We have a shared interest in peace and security,” the EU chief said.",8046,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/china/china-xi-jinping-european-leaders-beijing-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207084123-xi-jinping-eu-leaders-120723.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,china month aggression enhance smooth gesture official issue harder apparent technological chance free kind regard work attack tie follow hamas address move warn freedom agreement ambassador josep frankly trade described consensus senior stance company build september asia reiterate unknown russia result car practice medium summit middle relation industrial resilience strong low power decouple demand experience remove growth call sum dialogue nato holder multiple industry spearhead heel refer particular aim host ensure barrier watch mingjiang area long gathering breakthrough week closely spiral challenge russian secure shore engage list correct importance analyst odds yi support underway world partnership continue counterpart rise especially economy soas comprehensive clear side militant corre firm important risk director word policy president recognize passport technology focus international bloc trump criticism reality starkly repair associate outcome ambition beijing institute europe possible solution accord expectation borell country supply interest opening place hospitable nanyang difference set include communication peace israel partner return conflict auto political comment chain criticize gaza chinese ministry vehicle october travel security trading global protectionist washington arrive incentive keen tension spoke politically push trust lead roughly military electric connect system ahead virtual visit brussels detail council mutual commission wang xi press play european valuable maker steve human past despite different diplomat jinping blacklisting fellow concern expect minister rapid strengthen commit continuously high diaoyutai rival investigation key michel reduce provide start deficit leyen foreign historical soar joe stoke premier reach resolve recalibration deny wish friendly london stake kill launch tsang instead biden slam progress american france environmental stand state consequence handle major ready responsibility strike early signal decide charles concrete priority earlier society pursue wisdom echoed realize limited reference make potentially refuse perception imply administration line hong meeting begin claim demonstrate ukraine critical concession struggle philippe entry give report share mount invasion domestic germany ongoing terse maintain strain ursula unlike announce entrench level effort crackdown feel future gap amid xinjiang enclave deep interference blame union motivate imbalance singapore guesthouse market disengage tout abuse open year stay qiang pandemic grievance borrell significant goodwill competition innovation campaign quote run corporate stabilize busy believe frosty longer event illogical strategic late sanction spark election chief cooperation import top back condemn broad professor allege university largely diversify investment complete economic handful leader refrain position confrontation kong stick discus told big subsidy diplomatic thursday improve point fear,0.0176,0.1118568232662192,11.949964961457605,0.3309481302504558,0,2023-12-07
ABC,"Former Polish President Lech Walesa, 80, says he is better but remains hospitalized with COVID-19",2023-12-07 03:36:00,The Associated Press,"WARSAW, Poland -- Lech Walesa, Poland's 80-year-old former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner, said Thursday that he is improving after being hospitalized with a bad case of COVID-19.A post on Walesa’s Facebook page shows him lying on a hospital bed with his thumbs raised and a brief caption saying he believes he is going to pull through once again. He was no longer wearing an oxygen mask that he had in a photo on Tuesday.The former anti-communist dissident has faced multiple health scares in past years. He has diabetes and a heart condition that requires him to use a pacemaker. This is his second time having COVID-19.Walesa’s assistant, Marek Kaczmar, told The Associated Press that the former president was feeling better and his appetite had returned. Kaczmar said doctors plan to decide in the coming days when to send him home from the hospital in Gdansk, the Baltic port city where Walesa lives.One of his children, Polish lawmaker Jaroslaw Walesa, wished his father a speedy recovery from a podium in the Sejm, the lower house of parliament, on Wednesday.He encouraged his father to be in better shape by Monday, when Poland's outgoing right-wing government is expected to fail to win the backing of parliament, paving the way for a new centrist government led by political veteran Donald Tusk — an ally of Walesa's —to take power.“Monday will be a really good day. And I hope he will watch it with a smile on his face. We are returning to normality,” his son told fellow lawmakers.The elder Walesa posted a clip on Facebook of his son speaking in parliament and with it wrote: “OK.”Starting in 1980, Walesa spearheaded Poland’s pro-democracy Solidarity movement that nine years later led to the peaceful ouster of communism from Poland and inspired other countries to shed Moscow’s domination.",1813,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/former-polish-president-lech-walesa-80-remains-hospitalized-105449432,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/743b091b-4ceb-465b-bb68-fb96fff0f73c/wirestory_46a66b280a3b8d5e302ed6d53d9a1d01_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,case polish lech normality win hospital send warsaw press doctor diabetes past fellow oxygen shed expect veteran podium page house start winner day city wear tusk hospitalize backing wish elder government speak hope peaceful ouster low shape monday home solidarity smile decide require multiple spearhead marek pave gdansk appetite scare watch plan heart lawmaker ally assistant dissident inspire time recovery walesa write kaczmar child sejm facebook lie encourage fail show feel communism thumb jaroslaw president port year associate speedy nobel moscow country photo prize believe father longer peace domination outgo return poland former pull mask parliament centrist clip political donald movement post raise condition health lead told bed thursday improve baltic caption pacemaker,0.9798,0.0,9.572748538011696,0.2643280632411066,0,2023-12-07
Washington Post,Venezuela’s threats to annex most of Guyana draw international concern,2023-12-07 03:35:00,"Andrew Jeong, Matthew Hay Brown","It might be only a political stunt by an unpopular leader trying to win reelection. But threats by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to annex nearly three-quarters of oil-rich Guyana are drawing international concern.In a television appearance this week, Maduro presented a map that showed Guyana’s 61,000-square-mile Esequibo region as part of Venezuela. The authoritarian socialist told a crowd of government officials and supporters that he would create the Venezuelan state Guyana Esequiba, grant Venezuelan citizenship to its Guyanese residents, license the state oil company PDVSA and state metal conglomerate CVG to search it for oil and order energy companies currently there, including Houston-based ExxonMobil, to leave in three months.“The world has to know — the Republic of Guyana has to know,” he said, “the Esequibo is ours.”The reaction has been swift. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva offered Thursday to mediate between the South American neighbors. The U.N. Security Council scheduled a closed-door meeting on the matter for Friday. The U.S. Embassy in Guyana announced joint flight operations Thursday by the Guyana Defense Force and U.S. Southern Command.Venezuela has long claimed the Esequibo, a sparsely populated region of forest, swamp and scrubland. It’s a rare point of agreement in the deeply divided country; generations of schoolchildren have been raised on maps like the one Maduro wielded during his address Tuesday.Guyana has repeatedly rejected those claims, saying an 1899 international arbitration resolved the dispute. Venezuela has challenged the validity of that ruling. Its objections have intensified since ExxonMobil discovered massive reserves of oil in the ocean floor off the territory in 2015, a windfall that has turned Guyana, previously one of the hemisphere’s poorest countries, into one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.The International Court of Justice — to which the United Nations, at Guyana’s urging, has referred the matter — urged both sides last week to refrain from “any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute.”Maduro’s bluster seems unlikely to escalate to action. He and several members of his inner circle are under federal criminal indictment in the United States on charges of narcoterrorism. The once-booming oil industry — the country is home to the world’s largest proven reserves — has been crippled by outdated infrastructure, chronic mismanagement and U.S. sanctions.Amid an economic collapse, Maduro has worked to improve relations with Washington. The Biden administration agreed in October to ease some restrictions on Venezuela’s oil sector in exchange for Maduro’s pledge to hold freer elections next year — a breakthrough between the two countries, which severed diplomatic relations in 2019.But his remarks on Esequibo have unsettled Guyana and drawn warnings from the United States and Brazil.Guyanese President Irfaan Ali told CNN this week that Maduro’s declaration was a “desperate attempt by Venezuela to seize” his country’s territories. “We are taking every precautionary measure,” he said, including appeals to the United States, Brazil and the United Nations for diplomatic and military support to deter a Venezuelan invasion.The State Department confirmed the contact. “Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke with Guyanese President Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali to reaffirm the United States’ unwavering support for Guyana’s sovereignty,” the department said late Wednesday. Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that Washington supports a peaceful resolution.Brazil reinforced its northern border with armored vehicles and more troops, Reuters reported this week. Because Esequibo is largely inaccessible, the main road connecting Venezuela and Guyana runs through Brazil. Senior Brazilian diplomats have conveyed serious concerns to Venezuela, Reuters reported.In a referendum on Sunday, Maduro said, more than 95 percent of Venezuelan voters expressed support for annexing Esequibo.That percentage could reflect the actual popularity of the measure. But the government’s claim that more than 10 million Venezuelans cast ballots in the vote “makes no sense,” according to Enderson Sequera, strategic director for the Venezuela-based political analysis firm Politiks. That would be an unusually high turnout for Venezuela.Oil is not the only motivating factor for Maduro, Sequera said. The fixation on Esequibo also represents a sense of political insecurity following María Corina Machado’s resounding victory in the opposition’s presidential primaries in October. Machado, a longtime government critic, could present a formidable challenge Maduro in an election next year.",4710,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/venezuela-guyana-esequibo-map-border-dispute/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country conveyed raise socialist refer aggravate ocean win circle reaffirm guyana resolve threat urge strategic arbitration rare american side sunday charge improve intensified long troop vehicle dispute firm popularity large economic reserve draw appeal senior inacio leave primary miller antony windfall neighbor cripple address offer company embassy represent freer matter relation metal express percentage told poorest chronic nicolás cnn inaccessible critic mohamed schoolchildren refrain matthew deter insecurity wednesday cast ballot present repeatedly department biden reporter contact sequera accord warning fixation oil narcoterrorism energy maduro military reelection nation late referendum political extend unusually region southern crowd october drawn floor meeting measure enderson challenged spoke venezuelan turnout operation secretary home million authoritarian spokesman television action reuters unpopular international agree exxonmobil confirm border escalate turn map search remark friday opposition wield year machado precautionary connect resident populate claim supporter swift follow member politiks venezuela motivate deeply report sever pledge lula official leader corina desperate reflect sparsely outdated irfaan criminal swamp justice defense luiz ruling objection esequiba formidable peaceful force appearance make resound schedule factor voter blinken flight bluster court annex analysis exchange victory joint hemisphere administration scrubland mismanagement largely concern declaration reinforce road stunt cvg united industry unsettled validity diplomatic seize proven northern diplomat work license grant silva support president actual part citizenship forest presidential sovereignty infrastructure week state challenge high armored claimed conglomerate sector guyanese vote federal include director percent republic esequibo run council unwavering point government previously pdvsa reaction world announce restriction maría order hold thursday collapse washington generation brazil show agreement brazilian create election discover ease mediate divide indictment south breakthrough massive attempt security longtime territory reject currently,0.9539,0.1273885350318471,13.268030303030304,0.3544867724867724,0,2023-12-07
NPR,U.S military grounds entire fleet of Osprey aircraft following deadly crash off Japan,2023-12-07 02:43:00,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON — The military announced late Wednesday it was grounding all of its Osprey V-22 helicopters, one week after eight Air Force Special Operations Command service members died in a crash off the coast of Japan. The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps took the extraordinary step of grounding hundreds of aircraft after a preliminary investigation of last week's crash indicated that a materiel failure — that something went wrong with the aircraft — and not a mistake by the crew led to the deaths. The crash raised new questions about the safety of the Osprey, which has been involved in multiple fatal accidents over its relatively short time in service. Japan grounded its fleet of 14 Ospreys after the crash. Lt. Gen. Tony Bauernfeind, head of Air Force Special Operations Command, directed the standdown ""to mitigate risk while the investigation continues,"" the command said in a statement. ""Preliminary investigation information indicates a potential materiel failure caused the mishap, but the underlying cause of the failure is unknown at this time."" In a separate notice, Naval Air Systems Command said it was grounding all Ospreys. The command is responsible for the Marine Corps and Navy variants of the aircraft. The Air Force said it was unknown how long the aircraft would be grounded. It said the standdown was expected to remain in place until the investigation determined the cause of the Japan crash and made recommendations to allow the fleet to return to operations. In Japan, where U.S. military Ospreys had a non-fatal crash once and a number of incidents, the latest accident has rekindled safety concerns just as the Japanese government builds a new base for its fleet of Ospreys. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters in Tokyo the government has already formally requested that the U.S. military ensure the safety of Ospreys before their flights, but that Tokyo will seek further information from the U.S. side because it also affects the safety of Japan's own Osprey fleet. ""Needless to say, ensuring flight safety is the top priority of aircraft operation,"" Matsuno said. ""Japanese Self-Defense Force also operate Ospreys, and in order to ensure their flight safety, we will continue to ask the U.S. side to share information with us."" The U.S.-made Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much faster, like an airplane, during flight. Its unique design has been a factor in multiple incidents. While the investigation into last week's crash has only just begun, it renewed attention on the aircraft's safety record, particularly on a mechanical problem with the clutch that has troubled the program for more than a decade. There also have been questions as to whether all parts of the Osprey have been manufactured according to safety specifications. In August, the Marines found that a fatal 2022 Osprey crash was caused by a clutch failure, but the root cause was still unknown. In its report on the crash, the Marines forewarned that future incidents ""are impossible to prevent"" without improvements to flight control system software, drivetrain component material strength, and robust inspection requirements."" Air Force Special Operations Command has 51 Ospreys, the U.S. Marine Corps flies as many as 400 and U.S. Navy operates 27. The Osprey is still a relatively young aircraft in the military's fleet — the first Ospreys only became operational in 2007 after decades of testing. But more than 50 troops have died either flight testing the Osprey or conducting training flights in the aircraft, including 20 deaths in four crashes over the past 20 months. An Osprey accident in August in Australia killed three Marines. That accident also is still under investigation.",3806,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217757438/us-military-grounds-fleet-of-osprey-aircraft,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month material relatively impossible direct unique fatal aircraft control past troubled bauernfeind concern faster service expect japanese order command clutch reporter propeller program investigation hirokazu requirement prevent build forewarn needle record found unknown fleet materiel part underlie august government kill operate determine robust variant short particularly multiple priority test training crash factor australia notice make incident ensure software inspection mitigate long involve extraordinary root corp separate land begin week special time potential wednesday conduct share flight report manufacture drivetrain problem continue forward operates announce air crew affect side seek strength future risk rekindle head preliminary coast death secretary indicate number cruise fly formally wrong force indicates ground accord mistake component helicopter base marine mishap hybrid safety question place operation hundred accident cabinet airplane japan late decade include attention chief return statement tokyo mechanical request top naval remain step failure troop specification washington tony improvement standdown renew raise matsuno osprey young responsible recommendation lead navy operational member told military design rotate system information,-0.9261,0.1576458223857067,10.588321167883208,0.477419149477973,0,2023-12-07
ABC,Activist Agnes Chow says she still feels under the Hong Kong police's watch in Canada,2023-12-07 02:32:00,TIAN MACLEOD JI Associated Press,"BANGKOK -- Pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow, who left Hong Kong for Canada and doesn't plan to return to fulfill her bail conditions, said Thursday she still feels under the watch of the Chinese territory's police after moving to Toronto.Chow is one of Hong Kong’s most prominent young activists and was arrested in 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law that was enacted following 2019 anti-government protests. While she has not been charged and was released on bail, police confiscated her passport before returning it to her this year under certain conditions, including a visit to mainland China with authorities.Chow said in an interview with The Associated Press that Hong Kong's national security police called her twice to ask her about her status after she left the city to pursue further studies in September.“They keep trying to make me feel like I’m under their eyes,” she said.The intimidation of Hong Kong dissidents like Chow reflects the severe erosion of the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997. But both the Beijing and Hong Kong governments have hailed the security law, saying it brought back stability to the city.On Tuesday, Hong Kong leader John Lee hit out at Chow's decision to not return to Hong Kong to meet her bail conditions. He called Chow a “liar” and said attempts by police to offer her lenient treatment eventually led to them being deceived. Chow will be pursued for life unless she turns herself in, he said.Chow rejected the government's claim that police had offered her leniency, insisting her personal safety and freedom had been infringed. She said the restrictions imposed by the authorities on her daily life had badly affected her mental health.She said in an Instagram post on Sunday that her passport was only returned to her so she could pursue a master’s degree after she agreed to go to mainland China with national security authorities.During that trip in August, she visited to an exhibition on China’s achievements and the headquarters of tech giant Tencent, she said. She was asked to pose for photos. Later, police asked her to write a thank you letter to them before returning her passport to her, she said.Chow pondered for “a really long time” whether to publicize her experience. She said her trip showed the Hong Kong police were adopting more of the style of mainland Chinese authorities to “control” and “intimidate” political dissidents.“If I did not make my story public, these photos, these letters might one day become the evidence of my patriotism. That is something I do not want to see,” she said.In response to questions about Chow's comments, the government and the police asked the AP to refer to their earlier statements and transcripts of officials' previous remarks, including Lee's.They have condemned her decision to leave. Lee on Tuesday said Chow was arrested for alleged collusion with foreign forces and that those who have committed that offense have become foreign agents.Chow said that framing was “ridiculous,” pointing out she has not been charged three years after her arrest. She said her decision to move to Canada and not return to Hong Kong was entirely her own decision.“So we could clearly see that the national security law has become a political tool to the authority to make up accusations and to intimidate political dissidents,” she said.She said she was stopped from contacting her friends in Demosisto, a now-defunct political party she co-founded with other prominent activists Nathan Law and Joshua Wong.Demosisto was disbanded on June 30, 2020, the same day the security law was enacted. Wong is in custody on a subversion charge that could result in life imprisonment if he is convicted. Law fled to Britain, and Hong Kong police have offered a reward of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($127,600) for information leading to his arrest.Chief Secretary Eric Chan said Thursday that the security law helped shield Hong Kong from destruction by foreign countries and people who wanted to damage the city.""I despise those who broke the law, evaded their responsibilities and still bad-mouthed Hong Kong outside (of the city),” he said.While Chow is now thousands of kilometers (miles) away from her hometown, her worries about her safety remain.She pointed to alleged Chinese “secret overseas police stations” which have been reported across North America, Europe, and in other countries. China denies they are police stations, saying they exist mainly to provide citizen services such as renewing driver’s licenses.“But at least I could do what I want to do. I could say what I want to say,” she said. “I could finally start to heal my mental health issues.”___",4717,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/democracy-activist-agnes-chow-feels-hong-kong-polices-105449018,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/16ba5db3-07ac-453d-bd00-33aa37d813c3/wirestory_9543284ef71ff744685cb0c7edadba1b_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,china official tool follow evade move fulfill freedom pose lee reflect nathan exhibition result eric john government decision insist master experience hometown call prominent impose britain law refer severe citizen watch mental plan long north ponder left remark affected style mainland territory eventually status party imprisonment achievement national mile ridiculous colony overseas reward trip badly passport personal joshua away authority public associate beijing force tencent europe entirely safety frame country question offer photo headquarters life charge driver chow include offense return statement stability bail former political publicize enact comment security chinese dollar demosisto tech post damage giant adopt renew police contact canada health lead information arrest lenient hail visit despise liar kilometer instagram press control service exist confiscate leniency commit turn collusion provide start reject day foreign stop accusation subversion destruction sunday agree protest infringe august restriction convict activist bangkok previous patriotism responsibility study heal hit thousand earlier pursue interview make degree disband agnes brought hong dissident claim meet time response report daily intimidate release write attempt flee feel show evidence secretary chan shield transcript year broke british finally treatment leave intimidation worry tuesday custody back condemn allege station eye leader america kong condition deceive young erosion june letter denies million story thursday promise secret friend point city,-0.0781,0.1271994912020352,10.108205714285711,0.3425595238095237,0,2023-12-07
ABC,"Russian lawmakers set presidential vote for March 17, 2024",2023-12-07 02:25:00,DASHA LITVINOVA Associated Press,"Lawmakers in Russia set the country’s 2024 presidential election for March 17, moving Vladimir Putin a step closer to a fifth term in office.Members of the Federation Council, Russia’s upper house of parliament, voted unanimously to approve a decree setting the date.“In essence, this decision marks the start of the election campaign,” Valentina Matviyenko, the chamber's speaker, said.Putin, 71, hasn’t yet announced his intention to run again, but he is widely expected to do so soon now that election day is scheduled. Russia’s Central Election Commission plans to hold a meeting Friday on the presidential campaign.Asked whether Putin had decided to seek reelection, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged reporters to “be patient.”Under constitutional reforms he orchestrated, Putin is eligible to seek two more six-year terms after his current term expires next year, potentially allowing him to remain in power until 2036.The tight control over Russia’s political system that he has established during more than 20 years in power makes his reelection in March all but assured. Prominent critics who could challenge him on the ballot are either in jail or living abroad, and most independent media have been banned.Neither the costly, drawn-out war in Ukraine nor a failed rebellion last summer by mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin appear to have affected his high approval ratings reported by independent pollsters.Who would run against Putin next year remains unclear. Imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny urged his supporters in an online statement Thursday to vote for anyone but Putin.“Putin views this election as a referendum on approval of his actions. A referendum on approval of the war. Let's disrupt his plans and make it happen so that no one on March 17 is interested in the rigged result, but that all of Russia saw and understood: the will of the majority is that Putin must leave,"" the statement said.Members of Navalny's team said Thursday that they placed a number of billboards up in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities reading “Russia"" and “Happy New Year,” with links and QR codes leading to the website of their campaign against the Russian president, titled ”Russia without Putin.""The Associated Press found that some of the billboards already had been taken down.Two people have announced plans to run: former lawmaker Boris Nadezhdin, who holds a seat on a municipal council in the Moscow region, and Yekaterina Duntsova, a journalist and lawyer from the Tver region north of Moscow, who once was a member of a local legislature.Allies of Igor Strelkov, a jailed hard-line nationalist who accused Putin of weakness and indecision in Ukraine, have cited his ambitions to run as well, but extremism charges levied against him by the Russian authorities render his candidacy unlikely.Strelkov, a retired security officer who led Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and was convicted of murder in the Netherlands for his role in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet that year, has criticized Putin as a “nonentity” and a person of “cowardly mediocrity.”Strelkov was arrested in July and has remained behind bars ever since. He is facing five years in prison if convicted.For Nadezhdin and Duntsova, getting on the ballot could be an uphill battle. Unless one of five political parties that have seats in the State Duma, Russia’s lower house, nominates them as their candidate, they would have to gather tens of thousands of signatures across multiple regions.According to Russian election laws, candidates put forward by a party that is not represented in the State Duma or in at least a third of regional legislatures have to submit at least 100,000 signatures from 40 or more regions. Those running independently of any party would need a minimum of 300,000 signatures from 40 regions or more.Those requirements apply to Putin as well, who has used different tactics over the years. He ran as an independent in 2018 and his campaign gathered signatures. In 2012, he ran as a nominee of the Kremlin’s United Russia party, so there was no need to gather signatures.At least one party — A Just Russia, which has 27 seats in the 450-seat State Duma — is willing to nominate Putin as its candidate this year. The Interfax news agency quoted the party's leader, veteran lawmaker and staunch Putin supporter Sergei Mironov, as saying Thursday that A Just Russia would nominate Putin at a Dec. 23 congress even if the president decides to run as an independent.It wasn't immediately clear whether the Kremlin agreed to those plans. The party's press service told the AP it was the party's initiative, and the Kremlin did not immediately comment on it.Running as an independent is more likely for Putin, said independent political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin. “It will be too much honor for a party, he values himself highly. Therefore, I think he will run as an independent candidate, and will probably collect signatures. This will be a good pretext to promote the campaign in the regions.”Oreshkin, a professor at the Free University in Riga, Latvia, expects Putin and several other significantly less popular candidates to be on the ballot, such as Nadezhdin or longtime Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.The Central Election Commission plans online voting in addition to traditional paper ballots in about 30 Russian regions and is considering stretching the voting across three days -– a practice that was adopted during the pandemic and widely criticized by independent election monitors.Those measures on top of restrictions on monitoring adopted in recent years will severely limit the possibility of independent observers, according to Stanislav Adnreychuk, co-chair of Golos, a prominent independent election monitoring group.Andreychuk told The Associated Press that only registered candidates or state-backed advisory bodies, the Civic Chambers, can assign observers to polling stations, decreasing the likelihood of truly independent watchdogs. There is very little transparency with online voting, and if the balloting lasts for three days, it will be incredibly hard to cover nearly 100,000 polling stations in the country -– not to mention ensuring that ballots aren’t tampered with at night, he said.“Regular monitoring (at the polls) poses the biggest problem at this point,” Andreychuk said.“But we will be working in any case” he said of Golos’ plans, adding that they will conduct monitoring throughout the campaign and support activists who get to polling stations on election day.Analyst Oreshkin said the vote will be more of a ""ritual"" than a competitive electoral process.",6670,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russian-lawmakers-set-presidential-vote-march-17-2024-105449019,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/aed85630-b6f8-47c2-972f-2c134bbdeb52/wirestory_dcb4049245a651c06720ee0d39b8518f_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,render case separatist independently billboard dmitry hard adnreychuk central free work move levy pose intention riga reporter eligible requirement team costly add reading nominee russia weakness medium result practice decree agency chamber federation schedule supporter incredibly journalist minimum abroad represent significantly low decision power mercenary submit jet consider upper imprison vladimir prominent region widely malaysia multiple law unanimously cowardly advisory ensure jail plan north passenger role lawmaker electoral affected happen boris rig accuse latvia conduct challenge russian code regional party longtime lawyer analyst strelkov measure support nadezhdin collect presidential yevgeny establish forward ballot clear fail kremlin seek president eastern tactic july ritual highly expires addition authority oreshkin probably associate communist essence ambition igor transparency accord moscow rating country assure title online place process set website ran charge person bar statement municipal term former navalny political comment criticize unclear security happy approve put valentina adopt interested promote disrupt friday lead system prigozhin arrest reform spokesman severely petersburg tight council independent living commission andreychuk mention ten voting press polling value action control candidate different seat prison service duma united traditional expect veteran constitutional gather current competitive decrease high initiative house sergei urge night start tver day speaker found reelection observer understood critic peskov agree news view restriction convict activist matviyenko murder nonentity remains state civic extremism local decide staunch nationalist thousand stanislav nominates link orchestrate golos make potentially honor meeting stretch ukraine duntsova nominate indecision qr report uphill retire alexei cover putin problem summer announce regular balloting approval referendum rebellion mark airline number decides immediately march interfax year majority pandemic monitoring leave register campaign watchdog likelihood quote congress run poll recent popular election pretext chief hold gennady parliament top opposition professor remain legislature step university mironov body station limit leader tamper netherlands signature assign officer closer apply member told big vote battle thursday paper candidacy yekaterina possibility point city,0.8933,0.0899550224887556,11.37478260869565,0.3405331072436334,0,2023-12-07
Washington Post,"South Korea pushes ‘carbon-free’ plan, but its shift to renewables has slowed",2023-12-07 02:00:00,Michelle Ye Hee Lee,"SEOUL — South Korea is rolling out a new “carbon-free” campaign at this year’s COP28 that it says will reposition Seoul as a global leader in decarbonization. But climate experts and advocates say the plan, which promotes some fossil fuel power generation, merely masks South Korea’s dependence on nonrenewable energy sources.The country’s “carbon-free energy” plan promotes an array of energy sources that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions — like solar and wind — but states that “renewables alone cannot save the world.”A key part of the plan is the formation of a public-private group called the “Carbon Free Alliance,” led by the country’s biggest manufacturing conglomerates and its state-run utility company, according to an early “concept paper” obtained by The Washington Post. The companies will be “publicly certified” when they undertake efforts to be carbon-free, including by using nuclear, hydrogen and renewable energy. But it also includes fossil fuel power generation with carbon capture and storage.The proposal underscores the country’s reliance on its manufacturing industry and its influence over South Korea’s climate policy.Renewable energy accounted for 8.9 percent of South Korea’s electricity generation mix in 2022, which is the lowest among major economies. Coal and natural gas accounted for 60 percent, and nuclear was 29.6 percent, data show.Government officials are now circulating the proposal at international business events and global summits — including at COP in Dubai this month — and aim to release a finalized plan next year.“It’s a pity. It’s kind of a rollback” on South Korea’s climate commitments, said Yun Sun-jin, dean of the Graduate School of Environmental Studies at Seoul National University. “We should expand the share of renewable energy, and we should reduce our energy demand itself through energy conservation and efficiency improvement.”South Korea last week joined 118 countries at COP28 in pledging to collectively triple the world’s renewable energy capacity by 2030. The pledge acknowledges “different starting points, national circumstances and the unique realities of different regions.” South Korea is heavily dependent on emissions-heavy energy, and manufacturing sectors have a particularly long way to go in increasing its renewable energy supply.Under President Yoon Suk Yeol, who took office last year, Seoul has focused on expanding nuclear power, which is popular with the public but has long been scrutinized because of concerns over its safety and the challenge of disposing of radioactive waste.South Korea wants to increase the nuclear proportion of its energy sources to almost 35 percent by 2036. This includes building more small modular nuclear reactors, which produce low-carbon electricity and are becoming increasingly popular as countries seek alternatives to burning fossil fuels.Under Yoon, South Korea reduced its renewable energy target to about 22 percent by 2030 — 9 percentage points lower than under his predecessor.Asked about South Korea’s “carbon-free” plan and its slow transition to renewables, South Korean officials say they are taking a pragmatic approach because of the “tough conditions” of a manufacturing-dependent economy.“The manufacturing industry is very developed, and these industries use a lot of electricity,” said Lee Han-chul, director of the industrial environment division at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. “For example, semiconductor factories need large amounts of continuous energy.”Geographical constraints, such as lack of flat landscapes for solar panels, also make it more difficult to ramp up renewable energy production quickly, South Korean officials said.But independent analysts say South Korea has other renewable energy options and can overcome land mass challenges through regulatory changes.“Korea has huge wind potential, particularly offshore wind — arguably better than the U.K., which is the world leader in wind power,” said Sam Kimmins, director of energy for the Climate Group, a nonprofit that supports renewable energy transitions.Lee said South Korea is committed to reducing fossil fuel dependence and will listen to feedback from the international community about its proposal, which he emphasized is in its early stage.Cho Hong-sik, a presidential special envoy, gave a speech at COP28 last weekend calling on the international community to join the nation’s Carbon Free Energy initiative, describing it as “a realistic” solution to achieving carbon neutrality, according to a news release.The debate in South Korea over how to meet its climate target has become highly politicized in recent years.Under previous president Moon Jae-in, South Korea aggressively pushed new renewable energy projects such as solar and wind, and tried to phase out nuclear energy amid lingering fears over nuclear energy after the Fukushima disaster in neighboring Japan. But Moon’s push for renewables faced significant pushback, especially by the country’s energy-hungry industries, and led to rampant mismanagement.The Yoon administration is taking a new tack, but advocates and experts say South Korea has yet to embrace solutions that would make renewable energy more available and quickly, such as simplifying the permitting process for new offshore wind projects.“As a leading economy and a major emitter, South Korea must hold itself to the highest climate standards,” said Jonathan Pershing, former U.S. envoy for climate change. “That means rapidly accelerating its deployment of renewable energy and speeding its transition away from coal, oil, and gas.”Seoul’s proposal to use carbon capture technology has raised more eyebrows.Companies are increasingly using carbon capture technology as they transition away from fossil fuels, by capturing carbon dioxide from power plants and burying the CO2 deep into the ground. In the United States, for example, the Biden administration is offering tax credits to pay companies to capture CO2.But captured CO2 can also be used to extract more oil, rather than be buried underground — which activists say is just a way for oil and gas companies to continue their carbon-emitting operations.South Korea’s strategies to put into action its commitments under the Paris agreement, a global climate accord, “fall short of what will be needed” to achieve its target, according to research by Nathan Hultman, director of University of Maryland’s Center for Global Sustainability. Hultman is a former senior adviser for the Biden administration’s climate envoy, John F. Kerry.“The discussion this year [at COP28] is going to be, ‘Hey, we’re not on track. What do we need to do to accelerate the action in the next couple of years? Countries, including Korea, are going to need to put forward a new national target by 2025. So how are they going to be thinking of about this transition — now?” Hultman said.That means governments need to be thinking about their strategy beyond solely a carbon-free framing, he said.“If the focus by a government is just on carbon, they’re either deliberately or accidentally — neither one is good — ignoring a lot of the other emissions that cause climate change, so we have to recognize that ‘carbon free’ is a little bit too narrow of a framing,” Hultman said.",7280,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/south-korea-climate-cop28-renewables/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month gas emission huge official free kind sam describe mass agreement acknowledges lee nathan trade senior mix embrace renewables company formation increase carbon division continuous panel conservation summit john government community dean industrial rollback scrutinize low power environment demand particularly call efficiency decarbonization industry wind expand jonathan aim modular pay plan long extract aggressively energy graduate nuclear office tough week potential reposition seoul challenge offering fossil accelerate national yoon analyst nation support capture world continue ignore presidential especially economy listen forward adviser undertake utility flat nonrenewable target seek oil director proportion standard president underground recognize slow technology dependent focus international hydrogen reality deliberately away highly speech constraint large alliance public couple politicize coal solution ground accord climate conglomerate safety frame strategy country process change emphasize japan include former mask pushback moon envoy geographical group ministry overcome regulatory global washington factory concept post put underscore raise electricity phase certify cop korean triple nonprofit push lead natural small maryland ramp suk quickly produce expert increasingly project tack center independent offshore unique transition bury action source different burning concern united option credit sector commit yun roll high initiative south key lot reduce dependence array start achieve approach dioxide solar hultman school narrow rampant building part heavily reactor promotes news semiconductor activist biden fall short plant disaster previous environmental state major available early speed study production circulate linger bit percent make finalize account pledge research administration yeol land meet weekend deployment reliance special save give discussion share manufacturing emitter collectively obtain solely release kimmins effort alternative rapidly amid influence deep hey tax dispose permit publicly proposal commitment percentage developed feedback year track korea accidentally advocate significant paris radioactive campaign circumstance fukushima pity generation event recent capacity popular amount debate dubai fuel renewable neighbor hold pragmatic difficult university landscape pershing join realistic business leader sustainability condition lack data neutrality arguably big greenhouse paper simplify point fear,0.991,0.0824175824175824,11.921270333075132,0.4129846659364731,0,2023-12-07
ABC,Australia pushes against China's Pacific influence through a security pact,2023-12-07 01:28:00,ROD MCGUIRK Associated Press,"CANBERRA, Australia -- The Australian government signed a security pact with its nearest neighbor Papua New Guinea on Thursday that strengthens Australia’s place as the preferred security partner in a region where China’s influence is growing.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his Papuan counterpart James Marape signed the agreement in Australia’s Parliament House six months later than initially planned.The June date was abandoned after a security deal struck between the United States and Marape’s government sparked protests in the South Pacific nation in May over concerns that it undermined Papua New Guinea’s sovereignty.Marape said the agreement with Australia respects both nations’ sovereignty and was initiated by his government.He said the security agreements with Australia and the United States did not mean he was siding with those nations in their strategic competition against China.“Our major foreign policy as friends to all, enemies to none remains. And it’s never picking sides,” Marape told reporters.Albanese said both Australia and Papua New Guinea’s negotiators achieved what they wanted in the agreement.“This is a comprehensive and a historical agreement,” Albanese said. “It will make it easier for Australia to help PNG address its internal security needs and for Australia and Papua New Guinea to support each other’s security and the region stability.”Both governments have committed to release full details of the agreement but have yet to do so.The agreement is less significant than the treaty-level pact proposed early in the year, but the differences are not yet apparent.Papua New Guinea is a diverse, developing nation of mostly subsistence farmers with 800 languages in a strategically important part of the South Pacific.With 10 million people, it also the most populous South Pacific nation after Australia, which is home to 26 million.Papua New Guinea is a near-neighbor of the Solomon Islands where the government sent shock waves through the Pacific last year by striking a security pact with China. The pact raised fears of a Chinese naval base being established there.China later fell short in an ambitious attempt to get 10 Pacific island nations, including Papua New Guinea, to sign a sweeping deal covering everything from security to fisheries.Mihai Sora, an expert on Papua New Guinea at the Sydney-based international policy think tank Lowy Institute, said the pact cemented Australia’s position as a primary security partner in the region.“For Australia, it’s very much about bedding down the regional security order. Projecting to other Pacific countries that Australia is a trusted security partner,” Sora said.“The primary security dividend for Papua New Guinea will be addressing internal security concerns,” Sora added.Papua New Guinea struggles to contain escalating tribal violence and civil unrest in remote regions and has a long-term aim to increase its police numbers from 6,000 officers to 26,000.Australia has agreed to support Papua New Guinea’s internal security in areas of policing, courts and prisons.",3075,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/australia-pushes-chinas-pacific-influence-security-pact-papua-105448800,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/0080e4ba-6caf-4fea-87eb-5adaa2483228/wirestory_4a10f43acd75d1e033dba8d66ffa1a11_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,negotiator china month language detail project sweep papuan violence strengthens concern united address ambitious minister order prison agreement date papua australian commit initially develop south house pacific sign achieve foreign historical tank increase island part dividend agree protest government pact png respect populous anthony remains marape short state major fell propose solomon home primary strike early region wave australia aim make deal unrest area james lowy enemy sovereignty struggle canberra regional full diverse tribal bedding prefer remote nation support cover release counterpart establish comprehensive attempt side civil subsistence important policy influence shock internal expert international cement number pick year initiate sora easy institute base significant competition guinea country undermined place albanese difference abandon strategic strategically include spark court partner neighbor parliament naval security chinese contain escalate position raise police officer trust june told struck million thursday farmer friend fear,0.95285,0.2926829268292682,13.150095238095236,0.3655749354005168,0,2023-12-07
ABC,A milestone for Notre Dame: 1 year until cathedral reopens after devastating fire,2023-12-07 01:25:00,JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press,"PARIS -- When flames tore into Notre Dame in 2019, people who worked in the cathedral felt orphaned. But as the world-famous Paris landmark's reopening draws closer, they are beginning to picture their return to the place they call home and are impatient to breathe life back into its repaired stonework and vast spaces.The restoration of Notre Dame hits a milestone Friday: one year until the cathedral reopens its huge doors to the public, on Dec. 8, 2024. French President Emmanuel Macron will don a hard hat and tour the fenced-off reconstruction site where stonemasons, carpenters and hundreds of other artisans are hammering away to meet the 12-month deadline.When their job is done, they will hand over to Notre Dame's priests, employees, chorists and worshippers. With prayers, songs and devotion, they'll give the cathedral the kiss of life and celebration to nudge aside the pain the April 15, 2019, blaze inflicted on French hearts and Catholic faithful around the world.Notre Dame is “not the biggest cathedral nor perhaps the most beautiful,"" the Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, its rector, told The Associated Press this week, but “it is the incarnation of a nation’s soul.”“The expectations, the preparations for the reopening are a magnificent sign of hope in a difficult world,” he said.Henri Chalet, the principal choir conductor, already has butterflies at the thought. On one hand, he tells himself that in the 850-plus-year history of Notre Dame, its closure is just a blip and he needs to be patient a little longer. But for a human lifetime, “five years is very long,” he said, and “unfortunately, in 850 years, it fell on us.""“We are obviously impatient to be able to go back,” he said. ""It really is our home, in the sense that we were there every evening for services and also for concerts every week.“Now, we really feel there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said, ""with a lot of joy, enthusiasm and a little stress.”On the reconstruction side, recent progress has been remarkable. Huge oak beams, put together using carpentry techniques pioneered when Notre Dame was built in medieval times, have been hoisted skyward so the cathedral can be re-roofed. The towering spire now points once more toward the heavens, rebuilt piece by piece behind 600 tons of scaffolding.When Macron visits, the name of the retired French general who led the big-budget restoration before his death will be carved in tribute in the wood of the spire. Jean-Louis Georgelin died in August, at 74.And when Olympic visitors descend on Paris in their millions for the Summer Games opening July 26, the rebuilt spire and roof should be complete, giving the cathedral a finished look from outside.Work inside will continue. Jobs in the final months will include tuning the cathedral's thunderous 8,000-pipe grand organ, France’s largest musical instrument. It survived the fire but had to be dismantled, cleaned of toxic lead dust generated when the roofing burned, and reassembled. Renovations will continue after the reopening.The cathedral's own workforce also is being scaled back up. It was cut to seven employees because of closure for repairs. Dumas, the rector, said a hiring drive next year will restore the number of full-time employees to nearly 50, to welcome back the 15 million annual visitors and worshippers the Paris diocese is bracing for.Chorist Adrielle Domerg, who was 10 when she joined Notre Dame's choirs and is now 17, said the cathedral is “almost a person” to her.“A multitude of people, of dreams, of prayers gave birth to it,"" said Domerg, who last sang there with her choir days before the blaze and aches to do so again.",3655,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/milestone-notre-dame-1-year-cathedral-reopens-public-105448801,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/02bf465a-1430-4736-8e88-7ea92f43b004/wirestory_e9f939dfafed3a1099d340f131716d36_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,tour month huge cathedral pioneer fire hard tunnel work orphan stonemason general history georgelin butterfly grand hammer chalet ache hope medieval clean priest toxic home call tower scale tore long bracing lifetime birth week artisan welcome domerg spire light nation world continue breathe piece side dust president catholic july olympic away inside chorists large public repair associate impatient magnificent multitude devotion finish flame final expectation opening place remarkable hundred emmanuel life carpenter game include thunderous person return nudge song blaze restore landmark french rector musical put choir adrielle wood friday oak lead rev job april reopen visit unfortunately hoist reassemble blip press human cut duma service heaven worshipper roof sign faithful lot employee carpentry annual dismantle day vast beam skyward august stonework olivier picture incarnation progress france dame diocese fell reopens burn tribute hit concert celebration felt heart kiss patient carve restoration begin meet time joy beautiful give retire enthusiasm summer built draw feel reconstruction death number workforce preparation generate conductor year milestone visitor paris technique hand longer descend ribadeau recent dream back difficult pain prayer macron organ survive closure complete hire join rebuilt renovation inflict principal closer drive told big site million instrument point,0.99145,0.0,8.654061624649856,0.4726136363636362,0,2023-12-07
ABC,Indonesian maleo conservation faced setbacks due to development of a new capital city,2023-12-07 00:10:00,EDNA TARIGAN Associated Press and DITA ALANGKARA Associated Press,"MAMUJU, Indonesia -- A pair of tall birds with black feathers and pinkish breasts crossed a noisy road to reach a quiet part of a sandy tourist beach in the outskirts of Mamuju, a small town at the westernmost part of Indonesia’s Sulawesi island.There the maleos took turns digging a deep hole with their feet, then the female laid an egg several times as big as a chicken’s and buried it. When the birds departed, one of several poachers watching and waiting unearthed an egg prized as a delicacy.The maleo is a critically endangered and declining species that’s endemic to Sulawesi and its surrounding islands — a revered symbol of the country’s lush biodiversity. But the bird now is facing a new threat as Indonesia builds a new capital hundreds of miles away.West Sulawesi has been set up as a “support region,” so the regional government has been constructing roads and planning to build more ports here for transporting building materials to develop the new capital on Borneo.The maleo is “critically endangered because the next step is extinction,” said biologist Marcy Summers, director of Alliance for Tompotika Conservation, an NGO working on maleo conservation in Central Sulawesi provinces. “And the reason that it’s critically endangered is ... because of this problem of the taking of eggs and the destruction of their habitats.”A medium-sized bird less than 60 centimeters (24 inches) tall, the maleo is a striking species that has a small head with a helmet-like bony protrusion atop its skull. Males are distinguished by a knob at the base of their upper beak. The birds are unusual in that their chicks can fly right after hatching.Chairing the 2023 Association of the Southeast Asian Nations. Indonesia put the maleo bird on this year's ASEAN logo, as a testament to the country’s vibrant and diverse natural treasures.In Mamuju, the biggest hotel in town is named Maleo with big statue of the bird as a welcome — and countless local events use maleo birds as symbols.However, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species describes the maleo as critically endangered and declining with only 8,000 to 14,000 adults.With their habitat dwindling and nesting grounds facing encroachment from human activities, the journey of a maleo pair for egg laying grows ever more precarious and uncertain. Maleo populations have declined by more than 80% since 1980, Summers said.There is no specific number of how many maleos are left in Mamuju regency or in West Sulawesi region.The West Sulawesi Forestry Agency was only able to record maleos nesting grounds in 23 villages based on reports from residents. But only 18 are considered active nesting sites.In Mamuju regency, the mountainous forest lands where maleos typically live are located about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the downtown area — and there are concerns development in the region could lead to its extinction.“As far as I know, maleo birds are in decline,” said Andi Aco Takdir, chief of the West Sulawesi Forestry Agency. ”This is a consequence of, for example, the beach erosion. Then there is also land conversion by residents, or corporations, so that the habitat of the maleo bird has begun to shift and become extinct.”He said the government is continuously telling people and other stakeholders to stop forest conversion to palm oil plantations and not to develop anything, including tourism destinations, around maleo nesting grounds.Officials said the government is committed to keeping the birds even with massive development to support the new capital city.The maleo’s beach nesting grounds are situated less than 1 kilometer (.6 mile) from the forest, but they are separated by a long asphalt road, where noisy vehicles recently made a pair of maleos hesitate to cross it.When the birds successfully laid an egg to incubate in sand warmed by sun and thermal heat, poachers moved in. One of them dug the sand about 50 centimeters (20 inches) down, took the egg and brought it home.The poachers sell the eggs for only 15,000 rupiah ($1) to people who consider them a delicacy, like caviar. People in Mamuju and other parts of Sulawesi have a long history of giving eggs as a special gift.It is illegal to take the eggs since maleos are protected by Indonesian law. The maximum punishment is five years in prison and a 100 million rupiah ($6,400) fine for anyone who takes, damages, destroys, trades, stores or possesses eggs and/or nests of protected animals. But no one has received the punishment — and egg poachers still exist.Living side by side with the poachers, Mubarak and Abdullah, college students living around the Tapandullu Beach nesting grounds, have tried to make a simple hatchery next to Mubarak’s house.Abdullah realized the maleo population had sharply decreased since he was a boy. Mamuju residents are aware the bird is rare and it’s illegal to take maleo eggs, but unfortunately some people keep hunting the birds and eggs.“I am so worried the maleo will become extinct,” said Abdullah, who like other many Indonesians uses a single name. ”As time goes by, especially as this tourist attraction opens up, the place where maleo lay their eggs will automatically become more and more eroded because of the land taken by humans.”But coastal erosion demolished the hatchery by the end of 2022, destroying or damaging eggs they collected.“It was in front of my house, and I was confused which one should I protect first, the maleo eggs or my house,″ Mubarak said. “In the end, the residents and I decided to protect our house first, and the eggs and the hatchery were swept by the waves.”Now, they are trying to protect the maleo by telling other residents not to hunt the birds or take their eggs.Far from the downtown, the government is planning to build new seaports to transport construction material to Nusantara, Indonesia’s new capital city on Borneo. Activities such as clearing trees and gathering stones have disrupted forest habitat, and nesting grounds along beaches have become places to store and process stones for the seaports.West Sulawesi province is only a six-hour boat trip from the new capital — one of the closest regions that can provide construction materials. So the regional government is preparing seaports to accelerate shipments, said Muhammad Idris, West Sulawesi regional secretary.But Idris emphasized the regional government is committed to protecting the maleos even with development to support the new capital city that will replace Jakarta.“In fact, nature conservation must be used as an achievement and (projects) must not be built leaving behind problems,” he said.It is not too late to revive the maleo population that needs three essential elements to thrive: the native forest to live; a warm and sandy nesting ground along the beaches to lay eggs; and a safe corridor to travel back and forth.Conservationists say the bird also needs political will from the government and residents to prevent more losses of maleos.“It is possible to still restore and protect an area enough that maleos could continue to live, could continue to exist in West Sulawesi, in Mamuju regency,” said Summers of Alliance for Tompotika Conservation. “Because this is the only place left on the west coast of Sulawesi where they’re still alive.”___",7267,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/indonesian-maleo-conservation-faced-setbacks-due-development-plans-105447691,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9371256c-4d98-43aa-8eea-0bb0acb6864a/wirestory_b1a852f45a5e828345a8d87a04cb400d_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,mamuju endemic prepare sandy indonesia noisy thermal central indonesian protrusion threaten work live corridor move decline history incubate takdir native knob trade sand store receive prevent beach poacher mountainous asian nest build laid foot quiet chicken island statue distinguish extinct conservation agency unusual stone government forest destination consider upper maleo region endanger law tapandullu borneo watch area long sun planning gathering left resident countless hole welcome regional erode automatically uncertain accelerate achievement list mile town sell nation support continue confuse especially revere bird tompotika regency muhammad side trip oil threat symbol director asphalt population coast specific extinction swept abdullah critically encroachment posse fly idris boy road describes alliance heat aco possible ground boat tourism association country transport tree loss place process hundred set emphasize include destroy skull shift political southeast habitat restore vehicle travel illegal damage put fine disrupt tourist natural lead inch small student biologist forestry single downtown chick marcy thrive shipment project aware essential material kilometer unfortunately specie closest living typically bury human prison concern centimeter exist decrease commit develop continuously turn house protect rare provide clearing city stop record coastal logo destruction surround reason building reach nature part destroys asean simple andi development dug animal mubarak black consequence maximum replace bony ngo strike testament local activity decide iucn west capital warm fact successfully safe tall realize construction make locate hatchery brought land begin separate hesitate time special attraction front recently province give report diverse outskirt construct grows problem pair summer built biodiversity nusantara atop red plantation stakeholder male feather head revive conversion deep rupiah number delicacy village open active port year precarious leave lay base female wait hunt element corporation pinkish prize event depart late college journey chief demolish back sharply step vibrant seaport situate breast dwindle massive cross erosion egg beak unearthed big punishment million westernmost sulawesi worried lush palm caviar,-0.6168,0.3715425897894591,10.261826280623607,0.4797189582903869,0,2023-12-07
Washington Post,Myanmar’s junta may be on the verge of ‘collapse’,2023-12-06 23:59:00,Ishaan Tharoor,"You’re reading an excerpt from the Today’s WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday.For close to three years, Myanmar’s junta has held down the fort. It interrupted the country’s fledgling, imperfect exercise in democracy with its Feb. 1, 2021, coup that threw out a civilian-led government and saw the detention of myriad elected leaders, including Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. It withstood the popular pro-democracy uprising that followed, gunning down nonviolent protesters and jailing activists, artists and other dissidents. It shrugged off international censure and opprobrium, long-accustomed to operating on the world stage as a pariah. And it settled in for a multi-front civil war against an array of rebel outfits, from ragtag revolutionaries to the entrenched and well-equipped ethnic armies that have operated for decades in the country’s restive highlands.For a time, the junta seemed to be keeping threats to its primacy at bay. It adopted brutal tactics, including the indiscriminate bombing of villages full of civilians, that helped contribute to nearly 2 million people being displaced. But it seems the generals are now reeling in the face of an organized offensive by a coalition of rebel factions that’s inspired fresh campaigns by other groups, all of whom sense the tide of battle turning.On Oct. 27, an alliance of three ethnic armed organizations, dubbed the “Three Brotherhood Alliance,” launched a surprise campaign that overwhelmed the junta’s forces across a swathe of Myanmar’s northern borderlands. “In the span of 10 days, the Three Brotherhood Alliance said it had captured more than 100 military outposts and seized control over several major highways and border crossings, which is expected to hurt the junta financially,” my colleague Rebecca Tan reported a month ago. “Photos and videos posted on social media show rebel soldiers marching triumphantly through townships and posing in front of weapons reportedly taken from military battalions.”The junta’s opponents, within and outside the country, see a crucial opportunity. “The morale of the military junta and the soldiers is at its lowest in history because they are losing their rationale [for governing],” Zin Mar Aung, shadow foreign minister of the opposition National Unity Government, told Nikkei Asia this week. “We are receiving many defectors and most of the military camps are ready to surrender.” She added that “the military is getting ready to dissolve by itself” and could be “ready to collapse.”That’s a bold claim, especially given the military’s long history of clinging to power in Myanmar. But the pressures are clearly mounting on junta leader Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who on Monday urged the ethnic armed organizations to “stop being foolish” and resolve their differences with the central government “politically” — an overture dressed up in tough rhetoric that analysts suggest reveals the regime’s growing weakness. It’s losing ground, troops and military materiel by the day.“The Tatmadaw appears overstretched,” Rahman Yaacob of Australia’s Lowy Institute think tank wrote this week. “Besides engaging the rebels, the junta has to contend with anti-junta forces in areas under its control, demonstrated by the reported assassination of one of the junta’s cronies in Yangon.”Tan, my colleague, recently reported from the front lines among the Karen National Union, one of Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armies. She pointed to how these militias, once peripheral both geographically and politically in Myanmar’s fractious scene, now find themselves as key drivers of the resistance to the junta. Some are even drilling and arming dissidents from the majority ethnic Bamar population.“This combination of newer, pro-democracy insurgents and older, battle-hardened rebels has not occurred on this scale before in Myanmar and it has posed a potent challenge to the military,” Tan wrote. “In the heavily contested regions of Sagaing and Magway, analysts said, the most successful insurgents have been trained by ethnic rebel groups.”Experts are urging the Biden administration and other international actors to reckon with what may come. Analysts forecast a potential thinning out of the military’s ranks, a retreat from its positions outside a major urban centers, a drying up of its funds and even the possibility of an internal putsch that sidelines the current junta leadership.“It’s time for outsiders to recognize that the Myanmar military is losing strength fast, and an internal collapse—or further major breakthroughs by the opposition forces—could lead to a situation in which the military disintegrates, as has happened in many other countries,” Joshua Kurlantzick of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote.“But such a collapse, if not handled properly by both Burmese leaders in the exiled National Unity Government (NUG) and the leading, powerful ethnic militias, could also lead the country to disintegrate into a series of groups, lacking a common enemy, who could easily turn their guns on each other, creating total bloody chaos and completely gutting the remainder of the Myanmar state,” he added.To avoid that outcome, advised The Washington Post’s editorial board, “the United States should promote and prepare the National Unity Government, starting serious talks with representatives now. Officials with the group say they want a future Myanmar to be democratic and federal, recognizing the ethnic groups and guaranteeing minority rights. They need to be held to those commitments when crafting a new constitution, since they have the only way to stabilize Myanmar.”On the ground, the NUG’s reach may be limited, or at least circumscribed by the imperatives of the alphabet soup of armed factions operating in across Myanmar’s ethnic-minority borderlands. The Three Brotherhood Alliance is a case in point — comprising a bloc of armies that haven’t necessarily allied with the NUG and have long consolidated their own fiefdoms, some built on criminal operations. The alliance probably embarked on its offensive with the tacit blessing of China, which has a complicated relationship with Myanmar’s junta but also considerable influence over the ethnic militias in northern Myanmar.Beijing most recently wanted to see action against gangs conducting cyberscams against Chinese citizens from dens that sit across the border in Myanmar. The Three Brotherhood Alliance said squashing these syndicates was one of the goals of its offensive.",6595,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/06/myanmar-junta-collapse-military/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,china case month resistance prepare bloody assassination dress official central free laureate withstood follow nug general pose considerable tacit opinion history myanmar easily regime arm overstretch sideline receive add reading cyberscams asia possibility weakness medium outfit bamar fiefdom government relation operate rationale outsider protester threw elect primacy low suggest displace power today monday soup highway fort region retreat junta militia scale australia democratic circumscribed minority craft citizen civilian area editorial long properly lowy successful myriad breakthrough colleague happen inspire tough insurgent potential week disintegrates squash common allied conduct challenge engage worldview syndicate national drilling analyst guarantee capture world opprobrium northern especially cling unity seize faction chaos pressure opponent rest threat federal tactic recognize disintegrate advise tatmadaw international bombing actor bloc relationship dubbed video weapon joshua fledgling brutal alliance gun probably organize outcome force institute ground blessing camp country interest photo operating san jailing contribute detention difference exercise lose driver include embark imperative create overwhelmed group hlaing chinese complicate triumphantly total goal brotherhood troop scene washington post adopt crucial promote overture politically lead military urban gutting completely borderland reel expert remainder fund imperfect find center council necessarily fractious action control democracy fast alphabet ago united newsletter expect minister indiscriminate current hurt turn key rebel sign urge organization array start outpost foolish day foreign stop tank suu reach materiel resolve collapse heavily rank news artist censure activist launch ragtag biden crony newer handle state fresh major contend shadow ready representative comprise idea limited nikkei board magway crossing administration powerful line consolidated putsch dissident bold opportunity close claim yaacob demonstrate govern burmese time dry enemy recently front surprise give kurlantzick report full criminal swathe mount zin exile soldier rahman write globe township entrench built reportedly peripheral show civil strength span combination contest future constitution influence internal union rhetoric held commitment village pariah march year thin majority gang interrupt nobel reveals reckon series financially settle talk revolutionary occur campaign stabilize situation operation shrug decade avoid excerpt coalition popular sagaing defector kyi opposition dissolve social offensive forecast nonviolent coup inbox leader bay position border uprise lack ethnic geographically train told aung restive million stage army battle tide grow potent rebecca point,-0.89165,0.090978013646702,11.094271356783915,0.4248300382321001,0,2023-12-06
ABC,"China's exports in November edged higher for the first time in 7 months, while imports fell",2023-12-06 23:08:00,ZEN SOO AP business writer,"HONG KONG -- China’s exports rose in November, the first increase since April, while imports fell, according to customs data released Thursday.Exports rose 0.5% from a year earlier to $291.9 billion, a sign that demand may be picking up after months of decline. But imports fell 0.6%, to $223.5 billion, after they climbed 3% in October.China has been grappling with sluggish foreign trade this year amid slack global demand and a stalled recovery, despite the country’s reopening after its strict COVID-19 controls were lifted late last year.The trade surplus of $68.4 billion was up 21% compared to October’s $56.5 billion.Some economists said they doubt the rise, fueled mainly by exports of vehicles and ships, will continue for long.“Looking forward, the resilience of exports is unlikely to last. The recent strength is at least partly fueled by exporters slashing prices to gain market share,” Zichun Huang, a China economist with Capital Economics wrote in a note, describing the reduction of prices as “unsustainable.”“Without the support of price cuts, exports are unlikely to defy the slowdown in growth among China’s major trading partners, which we expect to continue in the first half of next year,” Huang said.Trade with Japan, Southeast Asian countries, the European Union and the U.S. has declined this year.Demand for Chinese exports has been weak since the Federal Reserve and central banks in Europe and Asia began raising interest rates last year to cool inflation that was at multi-decade highs.China’s property sector remains a drag on the economy, with sales slumping and developers struggling to repay massive amounts of debt.The central bank has eased borrowing rules and cut mortgage rates for first-time home buyers while providing some tax relief measures for small businesses. Late last month, it announced plans to issue 1 trillion yuan ($330 billion) in bonds for infrastructure projects and disaster prevention, dipping deeper into deficit to try to nudge the economy into higher gear.Thursday's data was released as President Xi Jinping was meeting with EU leaders. EU leaders were expected to discuss the large regional trade deficit with China and other issues including climate change and the Russia-Ukraine war.Exports to the EU fell 11% from a year earlier to $38.3 billion in November compared.

CNN,The first Chinese warships have docked at a newly expanded Cambodian naval base. Should the US be worried?,2023-12-06 22:21:00,Nectar Gan,"Chinese warships have docked for the first time at Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base, which is undergoing a Chinese-funded upgrade that has drawn concerns from the United States over its potential role in expanding China’s overseas military footprint.Cambodia’s Defense Minister Tea Seiha visited the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy warships docked at the Ream port on Sunday along with his father – and predecessor – Tea Banh, according to a post on the official’s Facebook page.While the post did not specifically mention the Chinese military, the accompanying photos showed two PLA Navy corvettes docked side by side. On board one of the corvettes, identified as the “Wenshan” on the vessel’s gangplank, Tea Banh reviewed a row of Chinese naval officers.The ships are in preparation for training the Cambodian navy, according to the post.Other photos in the post show the father and son inspecting infrastructure construction on the site and viewing a design plan of the project.Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore, said according to public records, this is the first time PLA Navy ships have docked at the port, which before renovation was only fitted for the Cambodian Navy’s smaller patrol crafts.“It is a signal that Ream is about to be completed. Of course, it’s still work in progress for them, but at least now, it has expanded to the point that it could accommodate a foreign navy ship,” he said.John Bradford, executive director of the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, said it is no surprise that Chinese ships were the first to visit the upgraded base.“After all, the facilities were funded by the Chinese and China is a close partner to Cambodia,” he said.The visit of Chinese warships coincided with a top Chinese general’s trip to Phnom Penh, where he hailed China and Cambodia as “true ironclad friends.”He Weidong, a vice chairman of China’s top military body, the Central Military Commission, told Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet that the two countries’ militaries have sustained “high-level cooperation in fields including high-level exchange, mechanism building, joint drills and exercises, and personnel training,” according to a Chinese readout of the meeting.Hun, who succeeded his father Hun Sun earlier this summer, thanked the Chinese military for its “strong support for the modernization of the Cambodian army,” according to the statement posted on the Chinese Defense Ministry’s website.The Chinese general also held talks with Tea, the Cambodian Defense Minister, to exchange views on “bilateral relations, military cooperation, and international issues of common interest,” according to the readout, which did not mention the visiting PLA Navy warships.CNN has reached out to China’s Ministry of Defense for comment.A US State Department spokesperson said Washington was monitoring reports of the Chinese warships, according to Reuters. “While we have no comment on this specific development, we have serious concerns about the PRC’s plans for exclusive control over portions of Ream Naval Base,” the official told Reuters, referring to China by its official name, the People’s Republic of China.The unprecedented presence of Chinese navy ships at the Ream Naval Base, which occupies a strategic position near the southern tip of Cambodia close to the South China Sea, is likely to deepen long-standing concerns among US officials that China is seeking a military outpost in the Gulf of Thailand.Such concerns were already heightened in June last year, when Chinese and Cambodian officials presided together over a ground-breaking ceremony for a project to renovate the port with grant aid from China.Cambodian officials have repeatedly denied the facility would be used by China as a naval base, insisting the project is in line with Cambodia’s constitution, which bars foreign military bases on its territory. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have described the base as an “aid project” to strengthen Cambodia’s navy and called assertions otherwise “hype” with “ulterior motives.”For the US, the Chinese-funded expansion at Ream is particularly troubling as it involved the demolishing of a US-funded facility there — a development that served as something of an analogy for Cambodia’s closer ties with Beijing and growing distance from Washington, according to Bradford at the Yokosuka Council.For some, the visiting Chinese navy ships have raised new alarms.“The arrival of these Chinese warships at Ream exposes China’s long-concealed military aims, marking a major evolution in China’s regional defense posture. To continue dismissing China’s expanding military footprint is to indulge in self-delusion,” said Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.Singleton, who wrote an analysis on Beijing’s growing push for overseas port access earlier this year, said China’s presence at the Ream Naval Base is part of a broader plan to complicate America’s global military calculus.“By building closer military ties and economic dependencies with select countries along major maritime routes, Beijing can exert diplomatic pressure on them, limiting U.S. basing access and complicating coalition-building efforts to support Taiwan’s defense should China ever invade,” the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own, he said.Alongside Djibouti in East Africa, Beijing’s sole military base overseas, Ream “signals more than just a cost-effective extension of China’s defense perimeter, but a calculated, assertive repositioning with grave implications for Washington and its allies.”But other experts have noted that the level of access the PLA is granted at Ream could be very different from its base in Djibouti, where Chinese troops can be permanently stationed at onshore facilities. That arrangement would be a violation of Cambodia’s constitution, said Koh at the RSIS.“There are many other types of access arrangements that don’t amount to or fall short of a real base agreement,” Koh said, such as allocating certain piers solely for Chinese navy use or ensuring the PLA Navy can be accommodated when it visits.“I think there’s a lot of it being overblown that it’s a base for the Chinese. I don’t think that’s the case,” he said.Cambodia has also appeared to be open to allow other foreign delegations to visit Ream – seen as part of its effort to refute accusations it is granting the Chinese military exclusive access to the naval base. Last March, a Japanese navy delegation visited the base.“Until we could see going forward, whether the Cambodians only allow the Chinese navy to dock at the base, or they will allow other foreign navies to dock, we cannot come to a very easy conclusion that it is arranged only for exclusive Chinese access,” Koh said.But even if Ream will not be used to exclusively and permanently station Chinese forces, gaining regular access to it could have implications for military operations related to the South China Sea dispute between China and the Southeast Asian claimants.Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims.“Ream would provide PLAN forces with an additional axis for attack and resupply in the case of a South China Sea conflict. Furthermore, bases on the Asian mainland would possibly be more easily resupplied, more resilient, and more capable than those established on relatively remote reclaimed features,” said Bradford, the analyst.But he noted that the facilities in Cambodia would not be a “game-changer” in a South China Sea struggle.“The distance (from) Ream to the Spratly Islands is greater than the distance from the Spratly Islands to major PLA bases on Hainan island,” he said, referring to the southernmost Chinese province and the disputed archipelago in the South China Sea where Beijing has built military installations on manmade islands.Chinese forces operating from Cambodia would have to fly over Vietnam or detour south to pass between Vietnam’s southern tip and the northeast corner of Peninsular Malaysia, making this line of attack vulnerable to interdiction, Bradford said.But Ream also allows the Chinese navy to dock much closer to the southern South China Sea – an important factor in China’s growing operations in Indonesia’s Natuna Sea and Malaysia’s Economic Exclusion Zone, said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.“This new naval base exceeds Cambodia’s present requirements, but its significance is more geo-strategic than purely military. It signifies the Sino-Cambodian defense relationship and adds to Vietnam’s concerns about being encircled by China,” Schuster said.",8944,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/asia/cambodia-ream-naval-base-chinese-warships-us-analysis/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231026160351-nectar-gan-medium-shot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country spratly vulnerable raise army lot refer northeast renovate fly fall craig record short top succeed southernmost inspect complete archipelago insist continue rsis line preparation public strategic grave resilient requirement amount relationship side sunday expert schuster facility liberation major troop heighten banh dispute manet footprint close economic described accusation wenshan port rajaratnam type resupply body installation resupplied project zone gangplank strong brunei dock senior africa view built evolution effort china exceeds aim hail warship sandbar exclusion navy arrangement ship open upgraded corner relation mention taiwan review koh conclusion write told study chairman course particularly level undergo overblown america executive readout push solely school reach expand surprise tip tea province global present route mainland repeatedly department presence station mechanism partner deny accord prime capable drill ulterior pacific establish common outpost potential military reposition role small southern construction broader board drawn arrival commission purely operation possibly exercise talk reuters international bar site design unprecedented vietnam demolish facebook preside perimeter former onshore field year claim post pla cambodian regional specifically related held report spokesperson penh relatively official row thanked vice japanese interest accommodate visit central interdiction indisputable carl june case defense posture accompany trip operating photo invade attack foundation malaysia expose modernization force make factor sole naval corvette vessel aid analysis forward exchange foreign joint expansion hype distance concern command feature assertion patrol permanently tie peninsular docked plan access limit united exclusively diplomatic phnom cambodia deepen sun work calculate mark grant support fellow assertive pressure violation ceremony compete hundred add progress different minister part comment dependency axis easy occupies complicate research signal seiha overseas building strengthen sovereignty base infrastructure easily delegation yokosuka southeast significance state encircle serve allocate seek select remote identify cooperation hainan control sustain arrange ream regular note position earlier reclaim exert bilateral include grow fit director island fund specific republic general important refute council real exclusive point tank singleton father personnel indulge ensure constitution bradford signifies involve chinese time hold statement issue washington additional detour coincide ministry asian ironclad extension philippine analogy intelligence beijing provide show djibouti pier agreement indonesia renovation development training east summer implication closer gulf mile conflict march trouble south monitoring prc portion maritime natuna great weidong manmade territory call dismiss upgrade singapore predecessor,0.9855,0.201252236135957,11.3419926199262,0.3584222087436375,0,2023-12-06
ABC,Helicopter carrying 5 senior Guyana military officials is missing near tense border with Venezuela,2023-12-06 21:18:00,BERT WILKINSON Associated Press,"GEORGETOWN, Guyana -- A military helicopter carrying seven people vanished Wednesday near Guyana’s border with Venezuela, with authorities saying there was bad weather in the area and stressing there was no indication it may have been hit by hostile fire as tensions escalate between the countries.Two crew members aboard the helicopter were taking five senior officers on an inspection of troops guarding a border area that Venezuela claims as its own, according to Army Chief Brig. Gen. Omar Khan.Venezuelan troops with heavy equipment and machinery have been amassing on the border in recent weeks, leading to speculation of an imminent invasion. Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali told The Associated Press earlier Wednesday that he was taking all necessary steps to defend his country.Khan told reporters late Wednesday that Guyana’s Defense Force lost contact with the brand new Bell 412 EPI aircraft after it took off from Olive Creek settlement in western Guyana following a refueling stop.Asked if the aircraft was shot out of the sky as it flew in a mountainous and heavily forested area, Khan said there are no indications that occurred.“We do not have any information suggesting that there was any flight by Venezuelan aircraft in that area,” he said. “Speculation is not what I want to go into. Our priority is to save the lives of our officers and ranks.”He said the U.S. government will help with the search when it resumes Thursday.The aircraft’s disappearance about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of the Venezuelan border comes as tensions heighten between Guyana and Venezuela over the Essequibo region, which is rich with minerals and located near massive oil deposits. Venezuela claims the region as its own, insisting it has been part of the country since Spanish rule.Guyana has maintained that the border defined by international arbitrators in 1899 is the correct one.On Sunday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro held a referendum in which Venezuelans approved his claim of sovereignty over Essequibo. Then on Tuesday, Maduro said he would immediately grant operating licenses for exploration and exploitation in Essequibo and ordered the creation of local subsidiaries of Venezuelan public companies.Guyana's president, when asked if he has requested military assistance in the dispute with Venezuela, said his government is reaching out to allies and regional partners, some of which Guyana has defense agreements with, to protect Essequibo. The region makes up two-thirds of the country.“We take this threat very seriously, and we have initiated a number of precautionary measures to ensure the peace and stability of this region,” Ali said in the brief phone interview.“Should Venezuela proceed to act in this reckless and adventurous manner, the region will have to respond,” he said. “And that is what we’re building. We’re building a regional response.”Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, but years of mismanagement and economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Maduro’s government have hurt PDVSA and subsidiaries.Maduro announced the creation of a Comprehensive Defense Operational Zone for the territory in dispute. It would be similar to special military commands that operate in certain regions of Venezuela.“The announcements by Venezuela are in full defiance of international law,” Ali said. “And any country that so openly defies important international bodies should be of concern not only for Guyana but for all of the world.”Guyana expects to bring up the issue at Wednesday’s U.N. Security Council meeting.The president said in a statement late Tuesday that his administration has reached out to the U.S., neighboring Brazil, the United Kingdom, France, the U.N. secretary general and the U.S. Southern Command, which oversees military operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean.Venezuela’s government condemned Ali’s statement, accusing Guyana of acting irresponsibly and allegedly giving the U.S. Southern Command a green light to enter the Essequibo region.Venezuela called on Guyana to resume dialogue and leave aside its “erratic, threatening and risky conduct.”",4145,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/helicopter-5-senior-military-officials-guyana-missing-border-105444028,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/eefb9056-6d9d-4ccd-b199-6ffac7e2cccc/wirestory_eed6b27465e6ad02f4f02aa569f715de_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,reckless fire machinery issue central threaten follow order agreement general reporter senior mountainous brazil aboard precautionary government operate mismanagement disappearance omar suggest bring forest insist rich guard call region impose dialogue grant law brig east ensure hostile deposit area brand week accuse territory conduct regional correct mile olive epi zone light measure world stress defense comprehensive crew exploitation oil threat important president risky settlement oversees international guyana authority large defies act public associate force accord essequibo helicopter adventurous country pdvsa operating lose life amass peace partner bell statement stability license western defiance security troop approve carry creek tension contact lead operational military speculation announcement information exploration proven creation council kilometer search georgetown equipment refuel press aircraft nicolás concern united allegedly expect indication command hurt shot south protect similar imminent irfaan sunday reach building part heavily sky france local priority hit earlier resume make inspection weather locate ally administration dispute claim sovereignty special wednesday save defend give flight manner full invasion proceed southern maintain assistance announce maduro openly erratic venezuela referendum venezuelan subsidiary secretary green vanished number khan held immediately reserve define year initiate arbitrator leave kingdom mineral heighten operation late sanction recent chief tuesday neighbor request condemn step irresponsibly body escalate heavy economic respond america spanish border massive officer flew member told army enter phone,0.52335,0.2171290711700844,12.207900552486183,0.4115377376246942,0,2023-12-06
CNN,Amnesty investigation claims US-made weapon used in two Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that killed 43 civilians,2023-12-06 21:07:00,not specified,"An investigation by Amnesty International alleges that a US-made weapons guidance system was used in two Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in October in which 43 civilians are said to have been killed.Fragments of the US-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions guidance system were found in the rubble of destroyed homes in the neighborhood of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to a report released Tuesday by the human rights organization.Israel uses a wide variety of American weapons and munitions, but Amnesty International’s report is one of the first attempts to tie an American-made weapon to a specific attack that left a significant number of civilians dead.The JDAM is a “guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into accurate, adverse weather ‘smart’ munitions,” according to the US Air Force.CNN cannot independently verify Amnesty International’s findings.Amnesty International said its weapons experts and a “remote sensing analyst” examined satellite imagery and photos of the homes that show the “fragments of ordnance recovered from the rubble” and the destruction, the report explains. Amnesty’s fieldworkers took the photos.As a result of these two attacks, 19 children, 14 women, and 10 men were killed, the report claims.The human rights organization said it “did not find any indication that there were any military objectives at the sites” of the airstrikes or that the individuals living in the homes were legitimate military targets.“The organization found that these air strikes were either direct attacks on civilians or civilian objects or indiscriminate attacks,” the report says, calling for the attacks to be investigated as war crimes.In a statement to CNN, the Israel Defense Forces called the report “flawed, biased and premature, based on baseless assumptions regarding the IDF’s operations.”“The assumption that intelligence regarding the military use of a particular structure does not exist unless revealed is contradictory to any understanding of military activity, and the report uses this flawed assumption to imply equally flawed and biased conclusions regarding the IDF, in line with existing biases and prior problematic work by this organization,” the IDF said.The statement said that the military “regrets any harm caused to civilians or civilian property as a result of its operations, and examines all its operations in order to learn and improve.”Amnesty International, in its report, said that the use of American weapons for such strikes “should be an urgent wake-up call to the Biden administration.”“The US-made weapons facilitated the mass killings of extended families,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, according to the report.The US State Department is reviewing Amnesty International’s report, spokesperson Matt Miller said Wednesday.“We have made clear in our discussions with Israeli leaders that we are deeply concerned about the protection of civilians in this conflict,” Miller said. “We expect Israel to only target legitimate targets and to adhere to the laws of armed conflict.”The Pentagon on Tuesday said it too was reviewing the report.“We are going to continue to consult closely with our Israeli partners on the importance of taking civilian safety into account in conducting their operations,” spokesman Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told journalists.Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign assistance since World War II, according to the Congressional Research Service. The US on average gives Israel $3 billion in military aid per year, and the Biden administration sought an additional $10.6 billion in military aid in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attack in Israel.The first attack referenced by Amnesty International occurred about 8:30 p.m. on October 10, hitting the al-Najjar family home and killing 21 of its members, as well as three of their neighbors, the report says.That bomb most likely weighed about 2,000 pounds, based on the amount of damage to the home and surrounding buildings, Amnesty claims. The year 2017 is also stamped into the plate, photos from the report show, indicating the bomb was manufactured in that year.“JDAM is a guided air-to-surface weapon that uses either the 2,000-pound BLU-109/MK 84, the 1,000-pound BLU-110/MK 83 or the 500-pound BLU-111/MK 82 warhead as the payload,” according to the US Air Force.Suleiman Salman al-Najjar, who survived the attack, told Amnesty he had been ill and returned from the hospital to find his home bombed and family killed. “I was shocked. I rushed home and saw a scene of utter destruction. I could not believe my eyes. Everybody was under the rubble. The house was completely pulverized. The bodies were reduced to shreds,” he said.The second attack occurred about midday on October 22 and hit three houses belonging to three brothers in the Abu Mu’eileq family, the report says. In total, 18 members of the Mu-eileq family were killed, including 12 children and six women, as well as one of their neighbors, the report says.Bakir Abu Mu’eileq told Amnesty he lost his wife and four of their children in the attack. Abu Mu’eileq – an ear, nose and throat specialist – said that he had been working at the nearby hospital when the attack occurred.“We are three brothers married to three sisters, living among ourselves, focused on our families and work, and far from politics. We are doctors and scientists,” Abu Mu’eileq said, adding, “we cannot understand why our homes were bombed. … There is nobody armed or political here. Our lives, our families, were destroyed completely, obliterated. Why?”Amnesty says photos show the bomb that hit the homes of the Mu-eileq family weighed about 1,000 pounds and was manufactured in 2018, according to the year stamped into the plate.“The US may share responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed by Israel with US-supplied weapons, as all states have a duty not to knowingly contribute to internationally wrongful acts by other states,” Amnesty warned.The human rights organization is urging the US government and other governments to stop transferring arms to Israel “that more likely than not will be used to commit or heighten risks of violations of international law.”“A state that continues to supply arms being used to commit violations may share responsibility for these violations,” Amnesty said.",6402,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/middleeast/amnesty-report-us-weapons-gaza-strikes-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206183011-01-deir-al-balah-gaza-october-2023.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,stamp independently central direct regard work attack tie mass legitimate hamas order extend general belonging arm learn woman facilitate property adverse aid add explains flaw result fragment spokesperson government harm ear specialist home call neighborhood variety abu contradictory rush law politics particular intelligence investigate kit civilian humanitarian recipient brigadier left nose idf closely conduct importance analyst recover world continue defense rubble fieldworker throat air clear protection target risk convert focus international specific pentagon weapon jdam large act force utter smart accord weigh objective safety assumption examines supply photo sister cnn contribute life lose include israel partner return statement deir conflict wake imagery ordnance political gaza october total scene damage satellite equally military structure system completely miller problematic amnesty wide expert spokesman sought verify ryder find married conclusion shred living hospital bombed object doctor human warhead service expect regret indiscriminate indication exist commit house investigation reduce urge organization killing foreign stop baseless found destruction surround building review eileq nearby kill reveal biden joint guide deeply duty american unguided callamard state brother plate patrick responsibility strike activity airstrikes adhere hit cumulative reference make weather imply account research destroyed administration transfer line tail bomb claim urgent israeli give discussion report share guidance individual remote manufacture salman release assistance child attempt premature obliterate show examine violation internationally accurate secretary shock indicate concerned number midday year pulverize scientist agnès base pound significant occur wife heighten believe operation additional knowingly average amount tuesday neighbor alleges family body consult survive understand billion wrongful eye congressional leader payload prior matt member told bias site department munition,-0.99495,0.4686035613870665,11.418886956521742,0.3096598639455782,0,2023-12-06
NPR,Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori freed from prison on humanitarian grounds,2023-12-06 20:53:00,The Associated Press,"LIMA, Peru — Peru's former President Alberto Fujimori was released from prison Wednesday on humanitarian grounds, despite a request from a regional human rights court to delay his release. Fujimori, 85, was serving a 25-year sentence in connection with the slayings of 25 Peruvians by death squads in the 1990s. Peru's constitutional court ordered his immediate release on Tuesday, but the Inter-American Court of Human Rights asked for a delay to study the ruling. Fujimori, who governed Peru from 1990 to 2000, was sentenced in 2009 on charges of human rights abuses. He was accused of being the mastermind behind the slayings of the 25 Peruvians while the government fought the Shining Path communist rebels. Fujimori, wearing a face mask and getting supplemental oxygen, walked out of the prison door and got in a sport utility vehicle driven by his daughter-in-law. He sat in the backseat with son and daughter, right-wing career politician Keiko Fujimori.Dozens of supporters awaited him outside the prison and swarmed the vehicle as it attempted to move. It moved slowly through the streets of the prison's neighborhood as people chanted and banged on the windows. Fujimori was expected to live at this daughter's house. Peru's Constitutional Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of a humanitarian pardon granted to Fujimori on Christmas Eve in 2017 by then-President Pablo Kuczynski. The country's Supreme Court overturned the pardon under pressure from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2018 and ordered the former strongman returned to prison to serve out his sentence. In Tuesday's ruling, the magistrates explained that while ""the seriousness of the crimes for which (Fujimori) was sentenced is evident,"" they cannot ""ignore... the humanitarian pardon"" granted to the former president in 2017 and upheld by their court in 2022. ""... If, according to the ruling of this Court in March 2022, the judicial resolutions that left the 2017 humanitarian pardon without legal effect were declared null, then (Fujimori) has been pardoned for almost six years without his freedom having been made effective to this day, which constitutes an obvious violation of this fundamental right,"" according to the ruling that also considered Fujimori's advanced age and poor health. After the Constitutional Court issued its latest ruling, the president of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Ricardo Pérez Manrique, in a resolution asked for the delay of Fujimori's release in order to ""guarantee the right of access to justice"" of the 25 people who were murdered in two massacres. ""We live in an orphanhood because we do not have institutions of any kind capable of defending us,"" Gisela Ortiz, sister of one of the victims for whom Fujimori was convicted, told The Associated Press. ""Peru gives the image of a country where the rights of victims are not guaranteed and where human rights issues have no importance."" The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, on Wednesday said the Constitutional Court's order to release Fujimori ""is a worrying setback,"" adding that ""any humanitarian release of those responsible for serious human rights violations must be in accordance with international law."" Fujimori remains a polarizing figure in Peru. His policies improved the country's economy and pulled it out of a cycle of hyperinflation. But he also used the military to dissolve Congress and rewrite the constitution as well as to crack down on guerrilla violence. The first of the two massacres he is accused of plotting occurred in 1991 in a poverty-stricken Lima neighborhood. Hooded soldiers fatally shot 15 residents, including an 8-year-old child, who had gathered at a party. Then, in 1992, the clandestine military squad kidnapped and killed nine students and a professor from the Enrique Guzmán y Valle University. Forensic experts reported the victims were tortured and shot in the back of the head. Their bodies were burned and hidden in common graves. The squad operated under the façade of an architecture firm and was financed by Fujimori's government. The accusations against Fujimori have led to years of legal wrangling. He resigned just as he was starting a third term and fled the country in disgrace after leaked videotapes showed his spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, bribing lawmakers. Fujimori went to Japan, his parents' homeland, and sent in his resignation by fax. Five years later, he stunned supporters and enemies alike when he flew to neighboring Chile, where he was arrested and extradited to Peru. Fujimori's goal was to run for Peru's presidency again in 2006, but instead, he was put on trial.",4655,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1217722106/alberto-fujimori-peru-freed-prison,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/12/05/ap23333814993682_sq-99a6d66ee42f1a2ae0880e97eaca0e2c30945879-s100-c15.jpg,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,delay guzmán driven commissioner issue swarm kind live violence capable order move rewrite freedom peruvian crack institution sentence street window bang add wear government supporter fujimori operate resign montesinos null ruling extradite walk consider fought justice neighborhood sat grant law magistrate fax alike volker lawmaker humanitarian left resident enrique peru sport accuse hyperinflation supreme common regional party presidency kidnap importance guarantee nation ignore pardon declare seriousness economy backseat judicial effect utility pressure alberto firm vladimiro ortiz president policy kuczynski international career resolution associate communist ground accord clandestine country sister evident japan charge include chant return strongman former term pull mask goal vehicle politician put wrangle mastermind overturn torture health lead student poor military pablo arrest expert parent massacre setback press polarize human image despite fundamental prison oxygen united expect constitutional gather high shot house slowly rebel start day favor accusation serve path manrique convict accordance obvious murder kill instead remains upheld bribing cycle burn study supplemental crime guerrilla make stun figure finance enemy govern wednesday access victim connection christmas defend turk give report gisela hidden soldier trial release pérez child chile slaying orphanhood attempt explain resignation flee show head eve violation immediate constitution death hood legal abuse valle march year disgrace forensic graf occur homeland keiko ricardo shin congress run guaranteed squad late court worry chief tuesday neighbor request advanced constitutes back leak professor await dissolve plot body university rule architecture effective fatally responsible flew videotape told daughter façade improve spy age,-0.9855,0.0644468313641245,10.145838218053928,0.2974706694271911,0,2023-12-06
CNN,Peru’s former President Alberto Fujimori released from prison,2023-12-06 20:46:00,Jimena de la Quintana,"Peru’s former President Alberto Fujimori was released from prison on Wednesday ahead of the completion of his sentence for authorizing the operation of a death squad in his country, according to court documents and images of the ailing ex-leader outside a Lima prison.The Constitutional Court of Peru on Tuesday had ordered the immediate release of Fujimori, restoring a medical pardon he received in 2017 from then-Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski as a humanitarian gesture. The pardon, however, was annulled a year later by the country’s Supreme Court, after which Fujimori returned to prison.The son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori was a deeply divisive figure before and after his hard-line tenure, which ran from 1990 to 2000, when he resigned following a bribery scandal. He is credited with defeating the Shining Path terrorists who destabilized the country, and his austere economic policies reined in hyperinflation.But the former president had an authoritarian streak and used security forces to crack down on opponents.In 2009, a special supreme court tribunal sentenced him to 25 years in prison for authorizing the operation of a death squad responsible for killing civilians.At the time of his pardon, Kuczynski’s office said Fujimori “suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable disease.”Then 79, Fujimori appeared in a hospital bed in a video he released that thanked Kuczynski.“The news of the humanitarian pardon granted by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski surprised me at this intensive care unit,” Fujimori said. “I am aware that the results during my government on one side were well received, but I recognize that I have also disappointed others, and I ask them to forgive me with all my heart.”Outrage over Fujimori’s 2017 pardon led to two nights of heated protests in Lima.The charges related to his authorization of a death squad that was tied to the “extrajudicial execution of 15 people in the Barrios Altos district of Lima, the enforced disappearance and murder of nine students and a teacher from La Cantuta University, and two abductions,” according to Human Rights Watch.In addition to the death squad charges, Fujimori was found guilty in separate trials of breaking into the home of a former spy chief to steal incriminating videos, taking money from the government treasury to pay the spy chief and authorizing illegal wiretaps and bribing congressmen and journalists.",2423,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/americas/former-peru-president-fujimori-released-prison-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206202407-01-alberto-fujimori-release-120623.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,gesture rein aware authorize hospital suffers human tie image follow prison order enforce japanese constitutional credit incurable crack receive extrajudicial sentence night thanked streak found destabilize path result protest news government treasury guilty murder fujimori resign kill completion journalist disappointed disappearance deeply bribing home break grant ail medical authoritarian terrorist divisive authorization barrio pay humanitarian figure progressive separate peru office pedro special time wednesday supreme surprised money trial bribery pardon release district side alberto president policy recognize immediate forgive death kuczynski wiretap immigrant annul video cantuta addition intensive execution year heat teacher force degenerative accord outrage alto steal country scandal defeat shin related operation ran charge squad court chief return tuesday former restore security university austere illegal document economic congressman tribunal unit incriminate responsible lead abduction student tenure bed pablo spy ahead,-0.9865,0.3714403631861328,12.266792452830192,0.3345598845598845,0,2023-12-06

CNN,Venezuela’s president orders creation of new state and map including land from Guyana,2023-12-06 19:49:00,not specified,"Venezuela’s president ordered the creation of a new state called “Guayana Esequiba” on Tuesday, following a controversial Sunday referendum which saw Venezuelan voters approving the annexation of land from neighboring Guyana.The area in question, the densely forested and oil-rich Essequibo region, amounts to about two-thirds of Guyana’s national territory. Venezuela has long claimed the land and dismisses an 1899 ruling by international arbitrators that set the current boundaries.Guyana has called the move a step towards annexation and an “existential threat.”Talking to legislators on Tuesday, President Nicolás Maduro showed a “new map” of Venezuela including the disputed territory and said all residents from the area would be granted Venezuelan nationality. He said the map would be distributed throughout all schools and public buildings in the country.Maduro also signed a “presidential decree” creating the “High Commission for the Defense of Guayana Esequiba.The measures announced include the approval of oil, gas and mining exploration licences. Maduro ordered the state oil company PDVSA to create a special department, “PDVSA-Esequibo,” to manage the activities in the region which are to start immediately.The president also asked legislators to draw up a law banning the hiring of any companies that have worked with Guyana in areas of disputed water, and giving companies currently in the region three months to leave the area.The measures also include a census among residents of that territory in order to facilitate the attribution of the Venezuelan nationality.In an interview Wednesday with CNN’s Isa Soares, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali called the Venezuelan moves “an imminent threat” and a “desperate attempt.”Ali said that Guyana was engaging with international allies, including the US, in “defense cooperation,” noting a “very elaborate cooperation pact” between the two countries.“They’re fully engaged on this matter. We are engaging the State Department, engaging the White House,” he said.Ali said he had also spoken with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who gave “assurance that Brazil stands strongly with Guyana and that they would not seek any reckless behavior by Venezuela.”Brazil in recent days moved troops along a border that it shares with the Essequibo region in a defensive measure, the country’s defense ministry said. Brazil has also sent a team to meet with Maduro, Ali said Wednesday.Speaking to reporters on Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington continues to seek “a peaceful resolution of the border dispute between Venezuela and Guyana”.“The 1899 award determined the land boundary between Venezuela and Guyana should be respected unless or until the parties come to a new agreement or a competent legal body decides otherwise. So we would urge Venezuela and Guyana to continue to seek a peaceful resolution of their dispute. This is not something that will be settled by a referendum,” he said.Sparsely-populated and with high rates of poverty, Guyana has seen rapid transformation since the 2015 discovery of oil off the coast of the Essequibo region by ExxonMobil, with over $1 billion in annual government oil revenue fueling massive infrastructure projects. The country is set to surpass the oil production of Venezuela, long dependent on its own oil reserves, and is on track to become the world’s highest per capita oil producer.Maduro stands to gain politically from Sunday’s referendum amid a challenging re-election campaign. In October, the Venezuelan opposition showed rare momentum after rallying around Maria Corina Machado, a center-right former legislator who has attacked Maduro for overseeing soaring inflation and food shortages, in the country’s first primary in 11 years.“An authoritarian government facing a difficult political situation is always tempted to look around for a patriotic issue so it can wrap itself in the flag and rally support, and I think that’s a large part of what Maduro is doing,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst with the International Crisis Group.Writing for Foreign Policy last year, ahead of the announcement of the referendum, Paul J. Angelo of the Council on Foreign Relations and Wazim Mowla, the assistant director for the Caribbean Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, called the border dispute a “powder keg,” arguing that Russian President Vladmir Putin’s “defiance of international norms” with the invasion of Ukraine “could give new wings to Maduro’s territorial ambitions.”Guyanese Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo echoed the comparison at a recent news conference.“I don’t know if they are miscalculating based on what happened in Crimea and other places, but it would be a grave miscalculation on their part,” Jagdeo said.“We can’t just think that this is internal politics (in Venezuela) without taking all possible measures to protect our country, including working with others,” he added, citing a visit in late November by US military officials to discuss ongoing joint training exercises.",5103,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/americas/venezuelas-president-orders-creation-of-new-state-and-map-including-land-from-guyana/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206154715-guyana-president-intv-thumb-vpx.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month gas reckless annexation official issue vladmir work attack follow oversee order move white agreement reporter licence facilitate team company silva brazil add infrastructure claimed decree spokesperson government pact relation respect november ruling forest monday award lula call region grant latin law authoritarian isa politics attribution norm atlantic area long argue resident happen caribbean territory challenge shortage russian engage party national analyst measure support corina world continue gunson presidential defense vice powder boundary oil seek director behavior threat president policy desperate maria patriotic coast dependent international matter guyana large resolution public grave possible essequibo country pdvsa question place cnn set wrap exercise include caput rate former political create defiance ministry october troop approve washington soares existential politically military announcement miller esequiba exploration ahead luiz bharrat visit creation machado project council center commission matthew surpass wing currently nicolás transformation current miscalculate paul rapid flag high controversial initiative house protect mowla rare sign urge start annual competent day foreign soar densely irfaan imminent school sunday building elaborate water fully part nationality news crimea determine joint peaceful keg stand state primary inacio activity mining comparison production training note exxonmobil phil dismisses echoed interview ally discovery dispute assistant territorial land meet legislator ukraine special wednesday strongly voter give share invasion revenue rally adrienne jagdeo ongoing putin wazim announce spoken draw maduro show guayana arsht venezuela approval referendum venezuelan poverty amid internal decides legal reserve year track arbitrator talk leave settle miscalculation base campaign food brazilian inflation situation assurance census defensive map distribute guyanese late recent amount cooperation tuesday crisis neighbor fuel tempt difficult opposition step momentum ban body billion hire america border massive discus manage department angelo,0.9025,0.2351557907113462,12.067552602436326,0.4276893939393939,0,2023-12-06
NPR,The College Board releases a new framework for its AP African American Studies course,2023-12-06 17:49:00,Joe Hernandez,"The College Board has released the updated framework for its AP African American Studies course, which was embroiled in controversy earlier this year following criticism from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state officials. The College Board — which offers Advanced Placement courses that can help high school students earn college credit — said Wednesday that it arrived at the newest version of the course framework after ""intense public debate."" The new framework is intended to be used when the course officially launches in the 2024-2025 school year. ""This course is a vibrant introduction to a dynamic field that offers a broader perspective,"" Brandi Waters, senior director and program manager of African American Studies in the Advanced Placement Program, said in a statement. ""This is the course I wish I had in high school,"" Waters added. ""I hope every interested student has the opportunity to take it."" Months back, Florida's Department of Education rejected the course, with state officials claiming that it had a ""political agenda"" that would indoctrinate students. The College Board revised the curriculum in February, but that drew criticism too, including from those who accused the educational body of caving to the demands of the conservative governor, who is now running for president. The new framework released this week excludes some topics that DeSantis had criticized, such as the Black queer experience, according to the Miami Herald. But it also includes a mention of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's protest of police brutality during the national anthem, as well as a reference to Black Lives Matter as an example of optional further study in the class. The governor's office deferred comment to the Florida Department of Education, which did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. Roughly 13,000 students in 700 schools across the U.S. are currently piloting the course.",1938,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1217649756/college-board-ap-african-american-studies,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/01/20/gettyimages-1244625128_sq-99d1c0a701cea81523de44ce8408843e45386adb-s100-c15.jpg,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month queer earn official topic defer mention excludes currently follow gov credit framework perspective intend high program senior reject add francisco school brandi water cave protest colin wish manager launch placement hope desantis black american state demand experience study intense agenda florida earlier field reference board governor broader pilot indoctrinate controversy opportunity claim office week accuse wednesday national educational introduction release miami drew revise brutality herald optional npr director course president anthem criticism matter immediately year public accord class african offer run quarterback san life officially include education college conservative statement debate former advanced request back political kaepernick february comment criticize version vibrant ron body arrive respond dynamic interested curriculum police student roughly embroil update department,-0.28505,0.1547987616099071,11.026358381502888,0.3059456635318704,0,2023-12-06
USA TODAY,"Released hostages slam Israel, say they feared airstrikes 'would kill us': Updates",2023-12-06 14:07:42,"John Bacon, Jorge L. Ortiz","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war Cabinet were assailed by released hostages and the families of those still being held by Hamas, who shared the horror of their experiences and questioned the government’s efforts to free the nearly 140 who remain in captivity. In a heated meeting Tuesday, Netanyahu and his colleagues argued that the only way to obtain concessions from Hamas is through a military campaign, and some relatives of hostages shouted “shame’’ at the prime minister when he raised the question of how to get the rest of the captives back. “This entire performance was ugly, insulting, messy,’’ Dani Miran, the father of a male hostage, told Israel's Channel 13, according to Reuters. Miran said he was so upset, he walked out midway through the meeting. Israel’s Ynet News published portions of audio from the session, in which a hostage who had been kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz tells about her ordeal. She was released along with more than 100 other captives during the weeklong truce that ended Friday and said she feared for her life because of the Israeli airstrikes. “We were in tunnels, terrified that it would not be Hamas but Israel that would kill us, and then they would say Hamas killed you,’’ she said. “So I strongly urge that the prisoner exchange begins as soon as possible and everyone needs to return home.’’ Another former hostage who was freed with her daughters but not her husband questioned how much the Israeli government knows about what Hamas is doing and raised the alarm about plans to flush out its fighters from the tunnels under Gaza. “We felt as though no one was doing anything for us. The reality is that I was in a hideout that was bombed and we became wounded refugees,’’ she said. “My husband was separated from us three days before we returned to Israel and was taken to the tunnels. And you're talking about flooding the tunnels with seawater?’’ Some families of hostages have accused Netanyahu of prioritizing the destruction of Hamas above freeing the hostages. He argued that it wasn’t until the Israel Defense Forces launched their ground attack that Hamas was willing to negotiate their release. “The second matter you raised, which is distressing, is hearing about the ordeals you endured with our bombings and military operations, those of the IDF, and it continues. It’s true,’’ Netanyahu said. “I find it deeply saddening. I can assure you that it’s not just saddening, as my colleagues will affirm, it also influences their operational considerations. And if you intended to convey this message, you have succeeded.’’ Developments: ∎ Yehya Sinwar, Hamas' top leader in Gaza, and military chief Mohammed Deif grew up in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, the southern city Israel is now attacking. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Sinwar is “not above ground, he is underground,” adding, ”Our job is to find Sinwar and kill him.” ∎ Some women in Gaza have been seeking increasingly scarce menstrual pads through social media. “For women and girls, the suffering is double,” said a Palestinian woman who identified herself as Umm Ahmed. “It’s more humiliation.” ∎ Netanyahu said a ""minimal amount'' of fuel will be allowed into the southern Gaza Strip occasionally to prevent a humanitarian crisis and the spread of disease. Israel has mostly blocked fuel supplies from entering the territory since the war started, saying Hamas takes it for military purposes. ∎ With the border city of Rafah swelling to more than twice its usual population of 280,000 because of incoming refugees, Egypt has deployed thousands of troops and erected earthen barriers to prevent a mass influx of Palestinians. Egypt says such migration would undermine its decades-old peace treaty with Israel. ∎ The Gaza Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 16,200, and more than 42,000 people have been wounded. The ministry said 70% of the dead were women and children. Israel has not disputed the counts but says it has killed more than 5,000 militants and accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields. 'In the heart of Khan Younis': Israel sweeps into major city in south Gaza Palestinians at shelters in Gaza's second-largest city were fighting each other over food Wednesday while the urban combat outside intensified, as Israeli ground forces clashed with Hamas militants in the center of Khan Younis. The United Nations says the fighting and road closures have made it impossible to distribute humanitarian aid to almost all of Gaza's southern half, where the vast majority of the enclave's 1.87 million displaced people − more than 80% of the population − have fled. The scarcity of sustenance has led to skirmishes in U.N.-run shelters, said Nawraz Abu Libdeh, a shelter resident who has been displaced six times. “The hunger war has started,” he said. “This is the worst of all wars.” More than 1,200 Palestinians were killed − 70% of them women and children − in the first five days since hostilities resumed Friday after a weeklong truce, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The city of Rafah in the far south remains one of the few spots in Gaza that offers relative safety and distribution of essentials like food and water, so tens of thousands of displaced people have trekked there in recent days, creating massive overcrowding. Shelters are beyond capacity and many of the new arrivals are sleeping on the streets, some in tents, others under the stars. “You find displaced people in the streets, in schools, in mosques, in hospitals … everywhere,” said Hamza Abu Mustafa, a teacher who lives near a school-turned-shelter in Rafah and is hosting three families. They're not certain to remain safe. On Wednesday evening, an Israeli strike in the Shaboura district knocked down a home and sent several injured people to a hospital, including at least six children. At least 10 men and women among the 110 released hostages were sexually assaulted or abused, a physician who treated some freed captives told the Associated Press. The doctor declined to provide more details and spoke on condition of anonymity to protect the hostages’ identities. Hamas leaders issued a statement Wednesday dismissing the claims as ""echoing baseless accusations of the Zionist propaganda to justify the atrocious killing of children, women and civilians in Gaza."" Fifteen women are believed to be among the more than 130 people still being held by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, the Israeli military says. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesman, said the army is “absolutely” concerned about sexual violence against female hostages. President Joe Biden called the reports of sexual violence “appalling” and urged the world to condemn “horrific accounts of unimaginable cruelty.” Freed Israeli hostage Mia Leimberg, who took her dog with her when she was seized by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, says Bella was a “huge help” while in captivity. Mia, 17, was released along with her mother a week ago. She says in a video posted Wednesday on social media that she believes her captors didn’t take Bella away because the puppy was quiet and went unnoticed. “It was quite a journey for both of us,” Mia says. “Overall, she was a huge help to me. She kept me be busy. She was moral support.” Mia, who lives in Jerusalem, was kidnapped with several other family members from a safe room in her aunt’s home in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. Israeli officials say 1,200 people were killed and at least 240 were taken hostage that day. While in Gaza, she said she fed leftovers to Bella, a Shih Tzu, and tried to keep her from “exploring too much” around the area where they were held. “I am so happy that I managed to do this journey with her,” Mia said. “I think honestly if it was a louder dog, if they had seen her as a bother, I think they would not have let me keep her.” Mia said she feels fine physically, does not feel traumatized mentally and is able to sleep. But she says it was a difficult experience and that “it will take quite a while to sink in.” Israel will pay a “heavy price” if it expands its war on Hamas to assassinate militant leaders living in Turkey or elsewhere outside the Gaza Strip, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. Hamas leaders have routinely sought safe havens in Qatar, Lebanon, Iran, Russia and Turkey. Israel has generally refrained from pursuing them to avoid diplomatic upheaval. But since the murderous foray into Israel on Oct. 7, Israel has warned that no place will be safe for Hamas leaders. Netanyahu recently said he instructed the Israeli spy agency Mossad to ""act against the heads of Hamas wherever they are."" Erdogan warned that Israel would find Turkish intelligence and security agencies a powerful adversary. “If they dare to take such a step against Turkey and Turkish people, they will be doomed to pay a price which they cannot recover from,” Erdogan told Turkey's Anadolu News Agency. “Those who attempt such a thing should not forget that the consequences can be extremely serious."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday discussed recent U.S. diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the war. Blinken reiterated the imperative of all parties working to prevent the conflict from spreading, the State Department said in a statement. Front and center was a discussion of the recent Houthi attacks against commercial ships in the Red Sea. Blinken said the attacks posed an unacceptable threat to maritime security and international law ""that all nations have an obligation to uphold."" The two sides are mostly in agreement on Gaza, and both governments support a two-state solution. President Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed the need for an immediate cease-fire, ensuring the humanitarian corridors are safe and unimpeded, and preventing the expansion of the conflict. Fuel and medical supplies have reached critically low levels at Al-Aqsa Hospital in the central Gaza Strip because of road closures despite the hundreds of patients needing emergency treatment after the Israeli bombardment, Doctors Without Borders warned. The hospital has been receiving on average 150 to 200 war-wounded patients daily. Without electricity, ventilators would cease to function, blood donations would have to stop and the sterilization of surgical instruments would be impossible, the group said. “There are 700 patients admitted in the hospital now, with new patients arriving all the time,"" said Marie-Aure Perreaut Revial, the group's emergency coordinator. ""We are running out of essential supplies to treat them.” Almost 1.9 million people, or 85% of the Gaza Strip population, have been forced from their homes since the war began two months ago, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees says. About 1.2 million of them are living in United Nations-provided shelters, the agency says. The death toll of UNRWA workers has climbed to 130. “Palestinians in Gaza are living in utter, deepening horror,” U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said at a news conference in Geneva, calling for a cease-fire. “My humanitarian colleagues have described the situation as apocalyptic.” US Navy ship battles in Red Sea against Houthi militants: How it unfolded Contributing: The Associated Press",11297,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/12/06/israel-hamas-war-gaza-live-updates/71822499007/,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2023/12/04/USAT/71805746007-fleeing-gaza.jpg?crop=1919,1079,x0,y0",International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month swell official commissioner occasionally central tunnel physically free tzu attack exchange convey hamas corridor instruct agreement described erdogan prevent street captor add reiterate quiet price russia expands oz flood jerusalem perreaut midway upset government undermine low surgical audio experience younis pad barrier hearing shih plan palestinian area volker colleague relative idf purpose accuse adversary party türk deepen insult nation support world stress truce bella seize side worker rest seek obligation spread underground population international critically terrify away distribution leimberg act forget associate teacher utter possible ground solution incoming refugee safety supply offer place contribute life endure include unnoticed israel conflict imperative create gaza ministry hamza weeklong group chinese arrive fine yehya spoke navy operational spot military urban reuters identify doom toll spokesman skirmish sweep surpass wang hospital flush press portion combat blood protect urge start iran foreign baseless accusation joe destruction sink conference assail identity earthen discuss trekked development ship launch biden alarm yitzhak recep affirm deeply state consequence strike unimaginable airstrikes medical thousand resume treaty migration felt account heart powerful patient begin negotiate hecht time wednesday concession front report daily obtain ordeal child district freed mother red effort flee star lebanon male fifteen hostage dani head influence death concerned khan relief abuse majority food prime busy daniel father distribute avoid sterilization leftover recent capacity amount aunt crisis fuel horrific shout back top remain family deif anonymity closure leader refrain border condition fighter manage member maritime houthi daughter hideout army battle enter libdeh sexual city fear huge messy fed bombardment issue louder minimal work geneva violence mass unrwa shaboura warn decline pose mohammed intend woman receive knock aid qatar nir shelter shame medium puppy agency distress sadden donation fight turkey displace deployed explore bring walk entire home overcrowd call abu strip menstrual prioritize law climbed sleep extremely host intelligence ensure civilian pay horror argue humanitarian resident sexually week traumatize territory richard kidnap miran recover yi continue defense session publish militant threat antony president atrocious bombing hunger sustenance girl commercial expansion reality matter video road repeatedly heat force accord channel message half assassinate camp arrival assure question erect emergency hundred bother peace cease revial return statement function former security troop seawater happy suffer post raise electricity foray friday health lead rafah kibbutz job dead increasingly sought routinely ugly essential detail find center hagari blinken living honestly impossible ten bombed tayyip xi doctor husband mosque human accuses jinping despite ago united netanyahu minister nawraz uphold physician performance south tent assault palestine high provide day stop injured murderous vast school ventilator usual mustafa reach water scarce ahmed generally news block captivity consideration kill remains major unfolded zionist prisoner clashed egypt pursue safe make dispute justify meeting separate claim captive recently israeli strongly discussion share sinwar admit influx southern release mentally attempt level unimpeded feel count wound treat immediate enclave secretary benjamin shield unacceptable dare held anadolu double scarcity dismiss mossad treatment talk female appal campaign run situation ynet believe operation upheaval cabinet journey average chief tuesday room condemn difficult step social hostility echo heavy coordinator intensified massive disease turkish propaganda absolutely told diplomatic million instrument spy department grow,-0.99885,0.3983358413738159,8.834425925925924,0.394578715217013,0,2023-12-06

Politico,US quietly pushing Israel to open a second Gaza crossing,2023-12-06 12:56:00,Alexander Ward,"The Biden administration is urging Israel to open a second Gaza crossing so more humanitarian aid can reach Palestinians, three U.S. officials and three aid group leaders said — but Israel has so far rebuffed those requests.Top administration figures raise the opening of Kerem Shalom — a vital throughway that Israel has kept closed over military and political concerns — “in every meeting,” a senior U.S. official said. Critics say the closure keeps essential food, water, medicine, winter clothing and other aid from reaching Gaza’s 2.3 million people. The outreach comes as international aid organizations have pushed the administration in private meetings, including with national security adviser Jake Sullivan, to use its leverage with Israel to open the crossing.“We have been engaged with Israel to enable a surge of humanitarian assistance through multiple mechanisms and options, including Kerem Shalom,” confirmed a second U.S. official, like others granted anonymity to detail a sensitive diplomatic discussion. A third administration official said such urgings have been delivered behind closed doors “for weeks.”The U.N. and aid agencies have long pressed Israel to open Kerem Shalom, but the simultaneous U.S. effort behind closed doors had not been reported.The only current operational throughway into Gaza is at Rafah on the Egyptian border, but that route isn’t equipped to handle a large influx of vehicles delivering aid. Kerem Shalom, situated at the intersection of Gaza, Egypt and Israel, is far more suitable to let in hundreds of aid trucks per day, the officials and humanitarian groups say. Among other things, it is equipped with robust inspection capabilities to ensure that only humanitarian assistance gets through.But Israel is resisting American pleas on military and political grounds, the latest in a series of pushbacks that has occasionally put Washington and Tel Aviv at odds on the conduct of the war, particularly how much to prioritize civilian harm reduction. The rebuff on Kerem Shalom has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups operating inside Gaza to distribute much-needed medical and food supplies. Many of those organizations have amassed aid on the Egyptian side of the border at Rafah in trucks that are stuck waiting in long lines to cross.Samantha Power, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, visited al-Arish, Egypt — a large humanitarian hub that collects and ships aid to Palestinians — this week and said that only a third of the provisions put up by the United Nations have reached Gaza.COGAT, the Israeli government’s office responsible for helping coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza, has publicly blamed the U.N. for failing to do more to streamline the trucks stuck on the Egyptian side of the border.International aid organizations have pushed back on the assertion that the U.N. is failing to keep up with demand.“The idea that somehow the U.N. is responsible for failing to get aid into Gaza is ridiculous,” a leader of an international aid group that operates in Gaza said. “Israel is just refusing to let many of these trucks in.” The leader was granted anonymity because they are actively trying to get supplies to the organization’s staff on the ground.Humanitarian groups want to see Kerem Shalom opened but insist it would still be nowhere near enough to help Palestinians in Gaza. “Even an uptick in aid flows won’t do much while Gaza remains under Israeli siege and bombardment,” said Scott Paul, Oxfam America’s associate director of peace and security. “Under current conditions, real aid delivery is a pipe dream.”Israeli officials fear that a line of trucks entering Gaza from Israel would make them irresistible targets for Hamas. Palestinian terrorists drove three explosive-laden vehicles into the checkpoint in 2008, wounding 13 Israeli soldiers. Four years later, masked gunmen entered about a half mile into Israel through Kerem Shalom after killing 15 Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula.Alleviating the pain of Palestinians would not be particularly popular in Israel, especially among some families of hostages still held by militants in the enclave. “The Israeli government has made a political decision, which I do not see any sign of changing so long as hostages are held by Hamas, of closing Kerem Shalom to movement of goods from Israeli territory directly into Gaza,” a senior administration official told reporters in November.Israeli officials shared these concerns with their American counterparts in discussions since the war began on Oct. 7. Spokespeople for the Israeli government and military didn’t respond on record to requests for comment.The U.N. has assessed that around 1.9 million people inside Gaza are displaced with 60 percent of the enclave’s housing units destroyed or damaged. There is no access to clean water in Gaza’s north and the average wait time to receive half the normal bread portion is four to six hours. Only 18 hospitals out of the territory’s 36 are functional.The Biden administration has stepped up its public calls for Israel to prioritize civilian harm reduction as it forcefully retaliates against Hamas for its attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s military campaign, which the Hamas-led Gaza health ministry says has killed more than 16,000 people, has spread to the whole of the enclave.There’s fear among U.S. officials that the resumption and widening of fighting following a weeklong cease-fire will only exacerbate the desperate situation inside Gaza.“The United States is determined to maintain the baseline achieved during the pause and expand the flow of humanitarian assistance to significantly increase the amount of humanitarian assistance,” said the second U.S. official. “We are engaged daily with the Egyptians, Israelis and others to ensure that this can happen on a continuous and ongoing basis.”Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who has commanded troops in the Middle East, told an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum over the weekend that “in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”Nahal Toosi contributed to this report.",6267,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/us-israel-aid-gaza-crossing-00130382,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/4648502/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe5%2F09%2F63690ea14376885225b23499e33f%2Fisrael-palestinians-13467.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hub official checkpoint occasionally bombardment kind attack follow hamas deliver reporter stuck victory arm senior receive bread aid gravity increase continuous masked agency government harm middle fight robust significantly decision displace delivery power insist clean private medicine mechanism particularly call multiple grant prioritize expand enable ensure actively east egyptian civilian palestinian north long humanitarian plea normal intersection clothing happen pause office week provision reagan conduct territory forum engage national mile ridiculous retaliates odds nation resumption counterpart collect especially widen defense exacerbate directly adviser side fail target militant tel spread director equip spokespeople desperate population forcefully sinai international pipe nahal inside large public baseline associate ground administrator half kerem supply opening operating change contribute hundred include jake amass peace israel movement lloyd rebuff political aviv group gaza ministry vehicle weeklong security oxfam troop washington damage put raise toosi push health rafah truck operational closing military austin shalom confirm irresistible urging visit gunman essential winter detail center impossible hospital route press portion audience coordinate concern united real current paul command option streamline urge sign organization assertion achieve day outreach record capability critic reach water throughway assess development ship kill determine remains biden tactical surge american handle state replace uptick sullivan pushbacks medical egypt idea terrorist percent make inspection resist refuse destroyed administration rebuffed leverage line figure meeting begin close enemy simultaneous weekend time israeli access discussion report share soldier influx daily housing ongoing maintain assistance operates vital effort wound hostage enclave secretary blame publicly held flow staff open year drove hour series sensitive wait campaign food situation distribute late strategic popular average amount suitable request back pain step family siege situate reduction anonymity closure respond leader america border unit condition cross responsible drive told diplomatic million enter scott fear,-0.9217,0.3350885591191957,11.871353315168026,0.3987048665620094,0,2023-12-06
CNN,Putin makes rare foreign visit to UAE as Ukraine war grinds on,2023-12-06 11:53:00,Anna Chernova,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said relations with the United Arab Emirates were at an all-time high during his first visit to the Middle East since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago.Putin praised cooperation between the two countries as he met President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi Wednesday, describing the UAE as “Russia’s main trading partner in the Arab world.”He is later scheduled to visit Riyadh to meet Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), as part of a whistlestop tour in which Moscow hopes to flaunt and continue to foster its close ties with Gulf states as wars rage in the Middle East and Europe.The visit marked a rare foreign trip for Putin since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have not ratified the ICC’s Rome Statute and so are not obliged to arrest the Russian president.The ICC’s arrest warrant has placed significant restrictions on Putin’s ability to travel internationally. He did not attend in person the BRICS summit in Johannesburg in August, since South Africa is a signatory to the Rome Statute.Putin enjoys good relations with both Gulf states, which have remained neutral over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite Western pressure for them to join sanctions against Russia.A cavalry escort accompanied Putin to the main entrance of the Qasr al-Watan Palace where he was received by his UAE counterpart, Russian state media TASS reported. The palace played the anthems of both countries before the presidents walked along a guard of honor.Stressing the historical ties between Russia and the UAE, Putin said the Soviet Union was one of the first countries to recognize the UAE as a sovereign state in 1971.The two leaders would use the visit to discuss issues ranging from oil and trade to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to the Israel-Hamas war, Putin said ahead of the talks.After the Abu Dhabi delegation, Putin will travel to Riyadh, Moscow’s main partner in OPEC+, a group of the world’s major oil producers to whose ranks Russia was admitted in 2016.The two Gulf states have also helped Russia to facilitate recent prisoner swaps.Saudi Arabia’s MBS played a key role in brokering a deal last September that helped release nearly 300 people, including 10 foreigners and commanders who led the Ukrainian defense of Mariupol.Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE were also involved in the agreement which saw US basketball star Brittney Griner swapped for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout at Abu Dhabi airport almost exactly a year ago, the two countries said at the time.CNN reported Tuesday – the day before Putin’s trip to the Middle East – that Washington had presented to Moscow another prisoner swap proposal as it tries to secure the release of two US citizens, ex-Marine Paul Whelan and the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.Responding to the report on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti:﻿ “We do not discuss this topic publicly.”Despite the Biden administration’s continuous efforts to bring home Whelan and Gershkovich, both of whom have been officially recognized as wrongfully detained by the State Department, there has been no success.Monday marked the 250th day of Gershkovich’s imprisonment, while Whelan is entering his fifth year in Russian detention this month.",3438,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/middleeast/putin-russia-saudi-uae-vist-israel-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206133219-02-putin-uae-120623.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,tour month palace dmitry topic wall issue describe tie agreement swap reporter mohammed trade arm receive facilitate street september russia medium continuous agency summit africa spokesperson schedule middle relation accompany hope griner bring walk guard home vladimir abu whistlestop east ukrainian citizen role involve oblige dealer russian delegation secure imprisonment whelan novosti continue world counterpart defense kremlin trip pressure oil president recognize international anthem ability qasr sovereign moscow arab foster ratify country crown soviet place detention include person icc present partner entrance western group travel trading washington airport lead arabia dhabi arrest ahead brics visit riyadh saudi escort brokering despite ago united commander paul commit viktor high south key rare day foreign historical neutral peskov part rank news august restriction ria foreigner cavalry biden gulf state major detain uae signatory basketball nahyan prisoner crime mb deal administration attend close meet ukraine rome wednesday johannesburg journal criminal report admit invasion evan putin salman release effort range star zayed internationally union warrant marked proposal gershkovich producer prince flaunt year bout significant played rage officially praise court enjoys sanction recent emirate cooperation tuesday remain brittney allege join leader discus statute told department enter wrongfully,-0.48375,0.0,11.670668841761827,0.2558536585365853,0,2023-12-06
CNN,Leaked audio of heated meeting reveals hostages’ fury at Netanyahu,2023-12-06 10:59:00,not specified,"Leaked audio recordings of a meeting between freed Israeli hostages and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have revealed considerable anger at the government’s conduct, as well as the enduring terror of captivity by Hamas in Gaza.Audio of the meeting between the former hostages, relatives of some still being held, and Israel’s war cabinet on Tuesday was leaked, with parts of it published on Israeli news site ynet.It comes amid building pressure on Netanyahu to secure the release of the remaining captives, and scrutiny of Israel’s intensifying military campaign in Gaza.Ynet also reported that Netanyahu’s efforts to respond to the hostages and relatives were met with tense and angry remarks.A female abductee freed with her children – but without her husband, who remains in captivity – is heard on one recording saying: “The feeling we had there was that no one was doing anything for us. The fact is that I was in a hiding place that was shelled and we had to be smuggled out and we were wounded. That’s besides the helicopter that shot at us on the way to Gaza.”She adds: “You have no information. You have no information. The fact that we were shelled, the fact that no one knew anything about where we were… You claim that there is intelligence. But the fact is that we are being shelled. My husband was separated from us three days before we returned to Israel and taken to the [Hamas] tunnels” under Gaza.Israel has launched intense air bombardments on Gaza since Hamas’ October 7 attacks on the country, which resulted in the capture of more than 240 people. The conflict has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and led to the deaths of more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which cites sources from the Hamas-controlled enclave.The former abductee continues: “Do you think the men are strong? My husband would beat himself every day, punch his face until it bled because it was too much for him, and now he is alone, and God knows under what conditions.”“And you want to topple the Hamas government, to show that you have bigger balls? There is no life here that is more important than others,” she adds. “None of us there deserve any less treatment than any resident of Israel. Return them all and not in a month, two months or a year.”Referring to reports that the Israeli military is considering flooding Hamas tunnels in Gaza, she continues: “And you are talking about washing the tunnels with sea water? You are shelling the route of tunnels in the exact area where they are. The girls ask me where is their father? And I have to tell them that the bad guys don’t want to yet release him.”The woman adds: “You put politics above the return of the kidnapped.”Netanyahu has been under intense pressure for weeks over the status of the Israelis still being held hostage by Hamas.A deal with Hamas has since seen dozens of captives – mostly women and children – freed, but the government remains under pressure to secure the release of the remaining captives, and has faced questions over the time taken to strike a deal. The IDF said Friday that there are 136 hostages still being held in Gaza, including 17 women and children.According to the ynet account of the meeting, one man related what family members had told him after being freed. “They were under constant threat from the IDF shelling. You sat in front of us and assured us that it does not threaten their lives. They also roam the street and [are] not only in the tunnels. They are mounted on donkeys and carts. You will not be able to recognize them on the street and you are endangering their lives. It is our duty to return them now.”And according to ynet, a parent whose son was kidnapped told the meeting it was his son’s birthday, and asked, “What do you have to say to him? He saved people there. You abandoned him.”Referring to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a member of the war cabinet, the parent adds: “You are arguing, Gallant, at a press conference. Enough. Bring them home.”Testimonies from released captives have shed some light on the conditions in which captives were held. Many referred to limited supplies and food; some said they were unaware of the fate of their loved ones during captivity, and a number of hostages required hospital care for days after their release.One woman who had been a hostage said in the meeting that those remaining in captivity were living “on borrowed time. All day, they lie on a mattresses, most of them need glasses and hearing aids that were taken from them when they were kidnapped, they have difficulty seeing and hearing, which affects their functioning even more. While I was there, I helped them slowly get up off the mattresses and be a little active. I don’t know what they manage to do since I have left,” the woman said, according to the audio released.“In addition to their physical condition, I feel that I left them in a very poor mental state. I and those who were released before me – I was young and active, I took care of them, I helped them to maintain optimism. They know they must survive, but they are on the verge of losing hope.”In addition to scrutiny over the release of hostages, Netanyahu and his government have been criticized for failing to prevent Hamas’ October 7 attack.The attack was widely seen as a major Israeli intelligence failure, with a number of top defense and security officials coming forward in October to take responsibility to some extent for missteps that led to the attacks.The woman heard in the recording added during the meeting: “Throughout the time we were there we felt abandoned twice, once on Saturday (October 7), when you did not protect us. And a second time every day that passes that we are not released. We didn’t believe we would be there for so long.”She issued an appeal to the war cabinet. “Every day that pass is a game of roulette in their lives, why don’t you release (Palestinian) prisoners? Release them all and bring them (hostages) back. They live on borrowed time. Their lives are in your hands, and I ask you, in the light of my testimony and what we hear from other released people and what we hear in the media, that there were all kinds of possibilities. If you can commit, each and every one of you, that you don’t give up on any opportunity, to bring everyone home and not postpone it by a day or an hour.”Comments at the meeting by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu were not released but were reported by ynet. CNN cannot verify they are accurate.Netanyahu is reported to have told the hostages: “I came together with my friends to hear you. There is still darkness to get rid of. And we need to bring them all back. I heard the anxiety, the humiliation, the suffering, the torture, the rape. This thing that shakes the whole world and it is important to continue to tell. It is important that we listen. You are right: there is a huge enterprise that collects evidence, trying to reach each and every one. How to bring everyone in.”At that point, there was heckling, with some people saying “Shame.”Referring to a dog tag with the name of a hostage that he had been given, Netanyahu said: “The dog tag you gave me is by my bed, it’s in my heart.”But the father retorted: “You don’t put it on your neck because you’re ashamed,” to which Netanyahu responded: “Absolutely, absolutely not.”Netanyahu continued: “The first thing you asked is whether we have the possibility to bring them home all at once. It is important to know, and my friends can reinforce that, that this thing didn’t exist. Until we started the ground maneuvers there was nothing. Nothing, nada, zero. Just talk.“Only when we started the ground maneuvers, only then was the pressure created that began to exert its signals on Hamas and this created the possibility of releasing hostages. With God’s help, we were able to increase the list and with the help of [US] President [Joe] Biden, who we asked him to help him with the matter.”When Netanyahu said Hamas was to blame for the end of the truce, an individual identified by ynet as a family member of a released hostage replied: “Nonsense.”Netanyahu responded: “No bullsh*t. What I’m saying here are clear facts. I respect you too much. I heard your heartbreak. We couldn’t release everyone at once. The price they want is not prisoners. The price they want is not only the prisoners.”The Prime Minister went on: “It is shocking to hear about what you went through in the face of our shelling and our activity, of the IDF, and it still continues.”“I can tell you that it penetrates not only the heart, it affects, as you will surely hear from my friends, also the considerations of our actions and if you wanted to bring this message - you brought it.”Netanyahu’s office declined to comment on the leaked recordings.",8812,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/middleeast/leaked-audio-of-heated-meeting-reveals-hostages-fury-at-netanyahu/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220407114243-meanwhile-middle-east-logo-large-169.png?q=h_439,w_1600,x_0,y_0/w_1280/h_80",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,love month huge official bombardment issue tunnel threaten kind live attack unaware hamas decline considerable woman prevent street surely add aid increase price result medium flood anger appeal government respect pass cart strong bring audio consider home exert punch sat widely exact endanger politics guy refer intelligence penetrates hearing mental palestinian area humanitarian argue left resident relative idf office week conduct secure yoav abductee status kidnap list light capture world continue collect truce defense listen forward donkey air clear fail intensify publish pressure threat beat important president recognize difficulty recording girl bullsh optimism addition zero fate ground accord message helicopter country supply misstep assure birthday question verge place cnn life game lose include endure heckle israel return conflict function former create comment criticize gaza ministry october security roam suffer put torture friday health lead poor military bed information identify parent lie verify hear living hospital deserve route press husband wash action source shed netanyahu minister tense exist tag commit shot protect slowly terror start day joe record building reach conference water part news maneuver captivity reinforce consideration reveal launch humiliation shell biden remains neck duty state glass major rape responsibility strike signal activity intense require hiding prisoner fact limited deal felt account dozen heart brought roulette heard meeting opportunity begin separate saturday claim time captive front israeli save give report mount individual angry release testimony maintain ashamed child heartbreak physical freed affect god effort shake reply feel show wound hostage evidence darkness amid knew continued death shock blame benjamin gallant held number active rid topple treatment talk female related food campaign prime hand bleed ynet believe father cabinet abandon tuesday crisis ball top back leak remain anxiety family failure postpone survive mattress borrow respond condition constant young ramallah absolutely manage member enterprise told big extent site retort scrutiny possibility smuggle friend point,-0.9833,0.2383113935542442,6.779527212754257,0.506475984333127,0,2023-12-06
Reuters,"In southern Gaza, Israel mounts fiercest attacks so far in war against Hamas",2023-12-06 00:57:00,"Bassam Masoud, Ibraheemabu Mustafa","GAZA, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Israel's military assaulted southern Gaza's main city in what it said was the fiercest combat since it began its ground invasion to eliminate Hamas five weeks ago, while the U.S. again pressed Israel to minimise Palestinian civilian casualties.Israel reported its forces, backed by war planes, on Tuesday reached the heart of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and also surrounded the city. Hamas' armed wing, the al Qassam Brigades, said its fighters engaged in violent clashes with Israelis.""We are in the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation,"" the commander of the Israeli military's Southern Command, General Yaron Finkelman, said in a statement.They were also the most pitched battles since a truce between Israel and Hamas collapsed last week. Israeli forces also fought in Jabalia, a large urban refugee camp and Hamas hotbed in northern Gaza next to Gaza City, and in Shuja'iyya, east of the city, Finkelman said.Hamas' armed wing said it killed or wounded eight Israeli troops and destroyed 24 military vehicles on Tuesday. An Israeli military website listed two troop deaths for Tuesday and 83 since the ground operation began.Gaza health officials said many civilians were killed in an Israeli strike on houses in Deir al-Balah, north of Khan Younis. Dr Eyad Al-Jabri, head of the Shuhada Al-Aqsa Hospital there, told Reuters at least 45 were killed. Reuters could not reach the area nor confirm the toll.Israel unleashed its campaign in response to an attack on Oct. 7 by Hamas fighters who rampaged through Israeli towns, killing 1,200 people and seizing 240 hostages, according to Israel's tally.Israeli police are investigating alleged sexual crimes and Israel's justice ministry has said ""victims were tortured, physically abused, raped, burned alive, and dismembered.""Hamas' media office said on Tuesday at least 16,248 people including 7,112 children and 4,885 women had been killed in Gaza by Israeli military action since Oct. 7. Thousands more are missing and feared buried under rubble.Those figures were not immediately verified by the Gaza health ministry.Since the truce collapsed, Israel has been posting an online map to tell Gazans which parts of the enclave to evacuate to avoid attacks. Khan Younis' eastern quarter was marked on Monday, home to hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom took flight on foot.Gazans say there is no safe place, with remaining towns and shelters already overwhelmed, and Israel continuing to bomb the areas where it is telling people to go.At Khan Younis' main Nasser hospital, the wounded arrived by ambulance, car, flatbed truck and donkey cart after what survivors described as a strike on a school being used as a shelter for the displaced.Inside a ward, almost every inch of blood-splattered floor space was taken up by the wounded including small children, with medics hurrying from patient to patient while relatives wailed.Two girls were being treated, still covered in dust from the collapse of the house that had buried their family.""My parents are under the rubble,"" sobbed one. ""I want my mum, I want my mum, I want my family.""Amid continued international criticism of Gaza's plight, the United States, Israel's close ally, reiterated on Tuesday that Israel needed to do more to allow fuel and other aid into Gaza and reduce harm to civilians. Despite the mounting death toll, it said Israel was now showing some receptiveness to the calls.""The level of assistance that's getting in is not sufficient,"" U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a press briefing. ""It needs to go up, and we've made that clear to the government of Israel.""U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that Hamas had repeatedly raped women and mutilated their bodies during its Oct.7 assault on southern Israel, citing survivors and witnesses of the attacks.""It is appalling,"" he told a political fundraiser in Boston.In a statement on its Telegram channel, Hamas denounced Biden's statements as false accusations and said he was joining Israel's effort to cover up war crimes in Gaza committed with U.S. support.In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited the claims of rape and other abuse in a meeting with families of returned hostages on Tuesday that some participants described as angry because of frustration over the government's handling of the situation.""I heard stories that broke my heart... I heard and you also heard, about sexual assault and cases of brutal rape unlike anything,"" Netanyahu said at a news conference.Israel says a number of women and children remain in Hamas hands. During the pause in fighting, Hamas returned more than 100 hostages while 138 captives remain.Biden blamed Hamas for the collapse of the truce last week, saying the militant group's ""refusal to release the remaining young women is what broke this deal"".Israel and Hamas have accused each other of wrecking negotiations.Hamas official Osama Hamdan said on Tuesday there would be no more captive releases until Israel's aggression stops.",5063,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/southern-gaza-israel-mounts-fiercest-attacks-so-far-war-against-hamas-2023-12-06/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZGPHH22DWJPCJLLGHBCUAV4JJI.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,flatbed online civilian deal town mount shuhada clash relative website child body home effort pitch shelter group vehicle troop command hamas situation arm ministry brutal unlike family burn fear hurry release floor truck hostage survivor amid claim fight evacuate dec qassam north action ago broke wreck fought news ally appal investigate abuse enclave accord despite ground verify force office report truce miss statement deir area confirm political close mum bury denounce northern seize plight aid wing military sobbed commit medic violent campaign rampage return sufficient khan stop aggression southern medium number camp witness small health rape hospital general ward fundraiser justice day participant continued spokesperson blame quarter younis jerusalem department large urban safe militant inch make show eliminate crime intense clear assistance false strike palestinian channel refugee response begin case physically map attack receptiveness commander minimise monday described invasion sexual reiterate fiercest united netanyahu parent immediately meeting mutilate allege osama eastern avoid collapse brigade gaza plane international space girl thousand operation rubble fighter nasser battle donkey told state hand cover engage join benjamin treat telegram dismember bomb marked flight dust patient city jabalia official house israel back heart woman accusation cart reduce east overwhelmed fuel victim accuse finkelman arrive government combat dr frustration continue include place captive death unleashed prime remain miller minister eyad criticism reuters refusal car angry briefing repeatedly torture joe toll alive list biden press surround figure hamdan part destroyed level yaron handle post harm gazans ambulance story hundred reach kill call wound head young school matthew israeli rap assault heard pause hotbed police president week tuesday,-0.998,0.4740272565672526,10.639611650485437,0.3472077922077922,0,2023-12-06

Reuters,US announces visa bans after warning Israel over West Bank violence,2023-12-05 22:51:00,"Simon Lewis, Daphne Psaledakis","WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. on Tuesday began imposing visa bans on people involved in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Washington officials said, after several appeals for Israel to do more prevent violence by Jewish settlers.A new State Department visa restriction policy targets ""individuals believed to have been involved in undermining peace, security, or stability in the West Bank, including through committing acts of violence or taking other actions that unduly restrict civilians’ access to essential services and basic necessities,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.President Joe Biden and other senior U.S. officials have warned repeatedly that Israel must act to stop violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. Attacks there have surged in recent months as Jewish settlements have expanded, and then spiked again since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel.Blinken made clear to Israeli officials during a visit last week that ""they need to do more to stop extremist violence against Palestinians, and hold those responsible for it accountable,"" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters in a press briefing after the announcement.Palestinian leaders must also do more to curb Palestinian attacks against Israelis in the West Bank, he added.The first bans under the new policy would be imposed on Tuesday and more designations will be made in the coming days, Miller said.""We expect ultimately for this action to impact dozens of individuals and potentially their family members,"" Miller said, adding that any Israeli with an existing U.S. visa who was targeted would be notified that their visa was revoked.Since a 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied the West Bank, which Palestinians want as the core of an independent state. It has built Jewish settlements there that most countries deem illegal.

Reuters,News Corp's UK papers settle phone-hacking claims with high-profile figures,2023-12-05 21:19:00,Michael Holden,"LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - News Corp's British newspaper group on Tuesday settled a series of claims of phone-hacking brought by celebrities and other individuals, including a ""Spice Girl"" and a former minister who said he was targeted because he was a political opponent.News Group Newspapers (NGN), the publisher of the Sun daily and the now defunct News of the World which former chief Rupert Murdoch closed over its involvement in hacking, had given public apologies and paid out ""substantial damages"" to the claimants, according to their lawyers.Those involved included Melanie Chisholm, or ""Sporty Spice"" from the well-known girl band, actor Keith Allen, and Shane Lynch from the band ""Boyzone"". As well as celebrities, the group included a victim of the 2005 London bombings.Katie Major, from law firm Hamlins, said Chisholm, also known as Mel C, said the phone-hacking - illegally intercepting voicemail messages - had caused her considerable distress.""As a result of the defendant’s articles, our client became paranoid and suspicious as to who was the source of the private information published in its newspapers,"" Major said.Phone-hacking first came to public attention in 2006, when the royal correspondent and a private investigator working for the News of the World were arrested and later convicted of accessing voicemails on the mobile phones of aides to the British monarchy.Subsequent revelations five years later forced Murdoch to shut down the tabloid, led to its editor and others being jailed, a public inquiry into press standards, and tens of millions of pounds being paid in damages by NGN.""As we reach the tail end of litigation, NGN is drawing a line under disputed matters, some of which date back more than 20 years ago,"" a spokesperson for NGN said.Chris Huhne, a former energy minister, said he had been targeted by NGN to destroy his career because he had called for a police investigation into hacking.""This settlement vindicates my long-standing claim that News Corporation directors and managers targeted me to get rid of a political opponent,"" said Huhne, who said he had received a six-figure sum in damages and that police should reopen their inquiries.NGN said it strongly denied that there was any corporate motive or direction to obtain information unlawfully.""Huhne was a senior politician and stories published were legitimate and in the public interest,"" NGN's spokesperson said.",2423,https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/news-corps-uk-papers-settle-phone-hacking-claims-with-high-profile-figures-2023-12-05/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NHGCYA4KPNIULFOELWU5BO43SI.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,law direction arrest suspicious huhne draw illegally date band energy phone group sporty correspondent dispute firm publish career million aide voicemail damage chisholm considerable editor opponent girl private settle claim publisher public series year dec ago mobile convict interest london sun corporate keith rid litigation lynch murdoch news boyzone paid back individual accord force daily sum unlawfully shane rupert victim manager major claimant celebrity line source political information close investigation include deny reopen attention access british pound motive spice brought target minister royal settlement reuters jail receive lead inquiry mel legitimate melanie give press actor distress message defunct article involvement destroy ten tail chief shut world matter hamlins result apology spokesperson hack newspaper standard vindicates story tabloid reach strongly corporation call politician investigator obtain ngn client corp intercept senior paranoid director involve work police revelation substantial former defendant tuesday,-0.94575,0.1238134543953776,11.041351351351352,0.1921006944444444,0,2023-12-05

Reuters,"Moody's puts China on downgrade warning as growth, property pressures mount",2023-12-05 21:15:00,not specified,"Dec 5 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's slapped a downgrade warning on China's credit rating on Tuesday, saying costs to bail out local governments and state firms and control its property crisis would weigh on the world's No. 2 economy.Moody's lowered the 'outlook' on China's A1 debt rating to ""negative"" from ""stable"" less than a month after it had done the same to the United States' last remaining triple-A grade from a credit rating agency.Historically, about one-third of issuers have been downgraded within 18 months of the assignment of a negative rating outlook.Beijing likely needs to provide more support for debt-laden local governments and state firms which pose ""broad downside risks to China's fiscal, economic and institutional strength,"" it added.Moody's also cited ""increased risks related to structurally and persistently lower medium-term economic growth and the ongoing downsizing of the property sector.""China's Finance Ministry called the decision disappointing, saying the economy would rebound and that the property crisis and local government debt worries were controllable.""Moody's concerns about China's economic growth prospects, fiscal sustainability and other aspects are unnecessary,"" the ministry said.Blue-chip stocks slumped nearly 2% to near five-year lows on growth worries, with some traders also citing speculation about Moody's statement before its release.China's major state-owned banks, which had been supporting the yuan currency all day, stepped selling of U.S. dollars on the news, one source with knowledge of the matter said.The cost of insuring China's sovereign debt against a default rose to its highest since mid-November, while the U.S.-listed shares of heavyweight Chinese firms Alibaba and JD.com dropped 1% and 2%, respectively.""For now the markets are more concerned with the property crisis and weak growth, rather than the immediate sovereign debt risk,"" said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong.It was the first change by Moody's to its China rating since downgrading it by one notch to A1 in 2017 when debt levels were rising.While Moody's affirmedthe A1 rating on Tuesday, noting that the economy still had a high shock-absorption capacity, it estimated China's economic growth would slow to 4.0% in 2024 and 2025, and average 3.8% from 2026 to 2030.Moody's main peer, S&P Global, said later in a long-scheduled global outlook call that its big concern was that ""spillovers"" from any worsening in the property crisis could push China's gross domestic product growth ""below 3%"" next year.China's government advisers are expected to call for more stimulus at the annual agenda-setting 'Central Economic Work Conference' due to be held in the next week or two.[1/2]A Chinese national flag flutters at the headquarters of a commercial bank on a financial street near the headquarters of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, in central Beijing November 24, 2014.

Many believe Beijing needs to transform its economic model from an over-reliance on debt-fuelled investment to one driven more by consumer demand.Last week, China's central bank head Pan Gongsheng pledged to keep monetary policy accommodative to support the economy, but also urged structural reforms to reduce reliance on infrastructure and property for growth.In October, China unveiled a plan to issue 1 trillion yuan ($139.84 billion) in sovereign bonds by year-end to help kick-start activity, raising the 2023 budget deficit target to 3.8% of GDP from the original 3%.After years of over-investment, plummeting returns from land sales, and soaring costs to battle COVID, rating firms have been warning about the contingent liability risks of debt-laden Chinese municipalities.Local government debt reached 92 trillion yuan ($12.6 trillion), or 76% of China's economic output in 2022, up from 62.2% in 2019, according to the latest data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",5237,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/moodys-cuts-chinas-credit-outlook-negative-2023-12-05/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/KFAJWWAST5N7RK5QWKER2ZVTLU.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,fitch increase cheung property lower change mount national ongoing pandemic central unveiled average contingent monetary trader firm soar ministry controllable data sovereign debt gdp growth adviser hogan structurally negative fund global curbed raise activity issue output big sell spent dec struggle slap pan chinese rightsanalysts equivalent china moody high news cost disappoint proven commercial note recover accord force rating budget month strength fx beneficial major statement concern imf slow worry source weak york licensing street assignment risk immediate wealth roll provide ken art unnecessary target return pace past p riley finally warn agency hong control push plan issuer yuan finance liability world matter day acquire persistently grade pledge hit institutional track heavyweight economy billion slump housing sustainability reliance share urge capacity stimulus policy recovery deficit sort downsize due flurry authority rate financial weigh decade insure original gross asian dollar strategist united bail geopolitical affirmedthe photo late bank believe consumer highly international investment stock breakneck battle sector trillion year state reform structural infrastructure plummet modestly step default gongsheng prospect measure low expect local stable annual reduce speculation support aspect october conference headquarters crisis respectively tension downgrade territory market government flag beijing analyst strong reopen compare trigger remain expansion agree reuters deepen pose mizuho product model watch outlook credit land worsen concerned drop accommodative b officially domestic held spillover knowledge part downside driven flutter level economic chief related notch widely broad bond november fiscal reach call head alibaba rise covid rebound peer transform currency estimate work pressure decision tuesday week,-0.8274,0.343708229902616,11.764851063829784,0.3281809269162209,0,2023-12-05

The fate of 138 captives who remained behind is still open.""I heard stories that broke my heart, I heard about the thirst and hunger, about physical and mental abuse,"" Netanyahu said at a news conference. ""I heard and you also heard, about sexual assault and cases of brutal rape unlike anything.""Several of the relatives who attended the meeting left bitterly critical of the government.Dani Miran, whose son Omri was taken hostage on Oct. 7 by Hamas gunmen along with around 240 other Israelis and foreigners, said he felt his intelligence had been insulted by the meeting and had walked out in the middle of it.""I won't go into the details of what was discussed at the meeting but this entire performance was ugly, insulting, messy,"" he told Israel's Channel 13, saying the government had made a ""farce"" out of the issue.""They say 'we've done this, we've done that.'

New York Times,Israel-Hamas WarBiden Condemns Rapes by Hamas on Oct. 7 and Its Refusal to Release Remaining Women,2023-12-05 19:59:00,"Michael D. Shear, Liam Stack, Nick Cumming-Bruce, Karoun Demirjian, Ben Hubbard, Talya Minsberg, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Isabel Kershner, Adam Sella, Ben Hubbard, Natan Odenheimer, Emma Bubola, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Anemona Hartocollis, Michael Crowley, The New York Times, Gaya Gupta, Edward Wong","‘Worse by the hour’: The W.H.O. warns of the likelihood of a humanitarian disaster in the south.House Democrats were divided over a resolution that equated anti-Zionism with antisemitism.‘Can I walk outside of the room?’ A medical center helps child hostages return home.An Israeli military spokesman estimates that several thousand Hamas fighters have been killed.Here’s how The Times is covering the war.President Biden on Tuesday condemned the “unimaginable cruelty” of Hamas attackers who raped and mutilated women in Israel on Oct. 7, and he blamed the group’s refusal to release its remaining female hostages for the breakdown in cease-fire talks.Speaking at a fund-raising event in Boston, Mr. Biden cited reports that Hamas fighters “used rape to terrorize women and girls” on Oct. 7, as they swept through Israeli towns and a music festival in the southern part of the country, killing more than 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.“Over the past few weeks, survivors and witnesses of the attacks have shared the horrific accounts of unimaginable cruelty,” Mr. Biden told donors at the event at a Westin hotel. “Reports of women raped — repeatedly raped — and their bodies being mutilated while still alive — of women corpses being desecrated, Hamas terrorists inflicting as much pain and suffering on women and girls as possible and then murdering them.”He added: “It is appalling.”Women’s groups and Israelis have waged an increasingly vocal campaign to press for condemnations of the sexual violence attackers committed on Oct. 7, and organized a meeting at the United Nations on Monday to press their case.Hamas rejected Mr. Biden’s assertions that its members committed rape and sexual violence on Oct. 7, issuing a statement carried by a Hamas-aligned channel on the messaging app Telegram.At the fund-raiser on Tuesday, Mr. Biden also echoed comments made on Monday by Matt Miller, a State Department spokesman, who said that Hamas had “reneged” on an agreement to release all the women it was holding hostage, and that the group’s officials “were never able to provide a credible reason why.”Hamas has said it considers the women to be soldiers. But President Biden said, “These are civilian women, mostly between the ages of 20 and 39,” adding, “Let me be crystal clear. Hamas’ refusal to release the remaining young women is what broke this deal and ended the pause in the fighting.”On Monday, Mr. Miller said that “a number of people believe” that Hamas did not want to release the female hostages because of the stories they would tell about how they were treated. But he said he was “not able to speak with a definitive assessment that that is the case.”Mr. Miller said the United States government had not independently assessed whether Hamas had committed sexual violence against the hostages while in captivity.“We’ve obviously seen the reports that Hamas has committed sexual violence, they’ve committed rape,” Mr. Miller said on Monday. “We have no reason at all to doubt those reports.”In the president’s comments on Tuesday, Mr. Biden did not say that the government had confirmed the reports of ongoing sexual violence against the hostages. But he urged people around the world to condemn the rapes for which there is already evidence.“The world can’t just look away at what’s going on,” he said. “It’s on all of us — government, international organizations, civil society and businesses — to forcefully condemn the sexual violence of Hamas terrorists without equivocation. Without equivocation, without exception.”He also vowed to continue efforts to get all of the hostages out of Gaza.“These women and everyone still being held hostage by Hamas need to be returned to their families immediately,” he said. “We’re not going to stop — we’re not going to stop until we bring every one of them home and it’s going to be a long process.”— Michael D. ShearHouse-to-house gun battles were raging around the southern city of Khan Younis, as Israeli forces and Hamas fighters clashed on Tuesday in some of the heaviest fighting of the two-month-old war, Israeli commanders said.Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, head of Israel’s southern command, described the fighting as “the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation,” which started in late October.Hamas said it had killed 10 Israeli soldiers in the city and had injured several more, a claim that could not be immediately verified. Nir Dinar, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said the army did not comment on casualties until after soldiers’ families were notified.Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, also claimed in online posts that its fighters had totally or partially destroyed 24 Israeli military vehicles; that its snipers had shot at least six soldiers in the city; and that eight Israeli soldiers were injured with an anti-personnel bomb, though it did not say where.None of Hamas’s claims could be immediately verified, but the pace of the posts seemed to confirm Israeli accounts of intense urban combat around Khan Younis, the largest city in the coastal enclave’s south.Since a temporary truce collapsed last week, Israel has focused its campaign on southern Gaza, particularly in and around Khan Younis, where it says Hamas leaders and fighters are concentrated.Hamas fighters are embedded in the strip’s densely packed buildings and hidden in an expansive network of underground tunnels, making close-quarters fighting unavoidable, Israeli officials said.“Our forces find in nearly every building and house weapons and in many houses terrorists, and engage them in combat,” said Herzi Halevi, chief of the general staff of the Israel Defense Forces. “We understand that part of their method is the weapons left in the houses. A terrorist arrives in civilian clothing and conducts combat from there.”General Finkelman said Israeli forces were “in the heart of Khan Younis” and also remained “in the heart of Jabaliya” and “in the heart of Shuja’iyya,” two residential areas in northern Gaza, which has been largely depopulated after weeks of intense airstrikes and instructions from Israel for Palestinians to leave the area.Hundreds of thousands of civilians fled to Khan Younis and other areas of southern Gaza after Israel ordered them to leave northern Gaza in the first month of war.But in recent days, Israel has issued new evacuation orders for large areas of southern Gaza. Human rights groups and aid agencies say civilians are now being pushed into a patchwork of smaller and smaller areas with no guarantee of safety.On Tuesday, Reuters interviewed Ibrahim Esbeitan, the father of an injured 2-month-old baby, Adnan, who was born on the second day of the war. Mr. Esbeitan was seeking medical care for the baby in a crowded hospital in Khan Younis.“They told us to leave Gaza City, there’s a war in Gaza, so we left and came here to the south just like they asked,” Mr. Esbeitan said, gesturing at his infant son on a gurney. “But this is what we’ve found in the south. What can we do?”— Liam StackIsrael expanded its evacuation orders in southern Gaza, ahead of an expected ground invasion in the south.Gaza’s humanitarian crisis is deteriorating by the hour as a result of renewed fighting, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, appealing for protection of civilians as tens of thousands of people in southern Gaza moved further south looking for safety and hospitals suffered further casualties and damage in Israel’s bombardment.“The situation is getting worse by the hour,” Richard Peeperkorn, the W.H.O.’s representative in Gaza, told reporters by video link from the enclave. “There’s intensified bombing going on all around, including here in the southern area, Khan Younis and even in Rafah.”Weeks after Israeli forces invaded northern Gaza, they have now moved ground forces deeper into the south and intensified airstrikes there. International pressure has grown not to repeat the level of civilian deaths and physical destruction inflicted in the north, but reports from Gaza show no change in the intensity of Israeli operations or the resulting casualties.The United Nations said Gaza experienced some of the heaviest shelling of the war from Sunday to Monday afternoon. Gaza health ministry, which operates as part of the Hamas government, reported 349 Palestinians had been killed and 750 injured in that period.An Israeli military commander, Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, said on Tuesday that the Israeli military was “in the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation — in terms of terrorists killed, the number of firefights and the use of firepower from the land and air.”The medical charity Doctors Without Borders said that 100 dead and 400 injured people had arrived at Al-Aqsa hospital in Gaza’s middle area on those days, and that the unit could barely cope with the number of patients. It said that Nasser Hospital, in the southern city of Khan Younis, which provides surgical care for trauma injuries and burns, was receiving multiple severely injured patients nearly every hour and was now near a breaking point.Israeli airstrikes also hit Kamal Adwan Hospital and Al-Awda hospital in northern Gaza on Sunday and Monday, killing nine people, the United Nations reported. More people were reportedly killed in an Israeli bombardment of areas close to Al-Ahli hospital, it said.Since a seven-day cease-fire ended last Friday, Israel has served evacuation notices to residents of areas in southern Gaza that housed around 470,000 people, the W.H.O. said, and the movement of Gazans fleeing from the middle area to the south had added to the strain on already overcrowded and under-resourced health facilities and resulted in a sharp rise in infectious diseases. The U.N. says that 1.9 million of the enclave’s roughly 2.2 million people have been displaced by the war.Israel has designated a number of “safe zones” to which it says people in Gaza should move to avoid the fighting, but many in the enclave cannot access Israel’s directions because they have no electricity and poor to nonexistent internet and cellphone service. United Nations officials say that nowhere is safe there and that the designated locations lack essentials for survival as required under international law.“These are tiny patches of barren land, or street corners, or half-built buildings,” James Elder, a spokesman for the U.N.’s children’s agency, told a news briefing. “There’s no water, no facilities, no shelter from the cold and rain.” The circumstances, he said, emphasizing the lack of any sanitation, meant that “these so-called safe zones risk becoming zones of disease.”Dr. Peeperkorn said that the W.H.O. had carried out an emergency evacuation of medical supplies from two warehouses in Khan Younis on Monday, on the advisement of Israeli forces, to save them from being destroyed in the hostilities and to ensure medicines continued to reach hospitals.Israel has denied instructing the W.H.O. to evacuate the warehouses, but Dr. Peeperkorn said staff carried out the “panic” operation after Israeli forces warned that the warehouses were in areas likely to become active combat zones and that they should remove as much of the medical supplies as possible.The W.H.O.’s top priority, Dr. Peeperkorn said, was to get more essential medical supplies into Gaza and then distributed to help its health system, largely crippled after two months of conflict, to cope with soaring health needs. Without that health system, “I want to make this point very clear that we are looking at an increasing humanitarian disaster.”— Nick Cumming-Bruce reporting from GenevaHouse Democrats splintered on Tuesday over a resolution condemning the rise of antisemitism in the United States and around the world, with more than half of them declining to support a measure declaring that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism.”The resolution denouncing antisemitism, drafted by Republicans, passed by a vote of 311 to 14, drawing the support of all but one Republican. Ninety-two Democrats voted “present” — not taking a position for or against the measure — while 95 supported it.That reflected deep and growing divisions among Democrats between those who have offered unequivocal support for the Jewish state and its actions, and others — especially in the party’s progressive wing — who have been critical of Israel’s policies and its conduct in the war with Hamas.“Under this resolution, those who love Israel deeply but criticize some of its policy approaches could be considered anti-Zionist,” Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the longest-serving Jewish member of the House, said in a floor speech before he voted “present.” “That could make every Democratic Jewish member of this body, because they all criticized the recent Israeli judicial reform package, de facto antisemites. Might that be the author’s intention?”Zionism began as the movement to create a Jewish state in the land previously known as Palestine, and since Israel’s founding, has been defined as the political ideology of supporting Israel’s continued existence as a Jewish state.The House has passed a number of resolutions in recent weeks to declare solidarity with Israel, denounce antisemitism and repudiate the actions of Hamas and its supporters, after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack that killed more than 1,200 people and took about 240 more hostage.Representative David Kustoff, Republican of Tennessee and the author of the resolution, rejected the suggestion that his measure was political, instead charging that Democrats have espoused anti-Jewish opinions.“We have seen members of this very body repeat blatantly antisemitic rhetoric and spread lies about Israel and her right to exist,” Mr. Kustoff said on the floor. “Let me be absolutely clear, such hate has no place in the halls of Congress, nor in our national discourse.”In recent weeks, Republicans and a number of Democrats have accused some left-wing Democrats of using antisemitic language. Last month, the House censured Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, for promoting a pro-Palestinian slogan, “from the river to the sea,” that is seen by many as calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.Ms. Tlaib denied that was her intention, defending the rhetoric as an aspirational call for Palestinian statehood. She has also come under fire from her colleagues for accusing President Biden of supporting a “genocide” in the Gaza Strip.Genocide is defined under international law as a crime with the intent to destroy a national, racial, ethnic or religious group. Israeli officials have insisted they are trying to target Hamas, blaming the terrorist group for any collateral damage. Some human rights officials have questioned Israel’s tactics, however, as the civilian death toll has climbed, with the health authorities in Gaza estimating more than 15,500 have been killed.Such sentiments have been echoed by pro-Palestinian protesters in large cities and on college campuses, during demonstrations that have sometimes been punctuated by voices questioning Israel’s right to exist, and incidents targeting Jewish students.Democrats questioning the resolution called such displays of anti-Jewish sentiment unacceptable, but said equating all anti-Zionism to antisemitism went too far.“Let me be unequivocally clear: most anti-Zionism, particularly in this moment, has a real antisemitism problem,” Mr. Nadler said. “But we cannot fairly say that one equals the other.”— Karoun DemirjianIn the days since the collapse of a seven-day truce, as Israeli forces have turned their focus to southern Gaza to root out what they say are Hamas fighters holed up there, Biden administration officials have said they had warned Israel to work harder to avoid harming Gazan civilians than it did in the war’s early weeks, and that Israel’s military appeared to be heeding that advice.But more than 300 people were killed in Gaza each day between Saturday and Monday, according to figures released by Gazan health officials, a daily toll that resembled those from the earlier weeks of the war. The U.N. humanitarian office said that the period from Sunday to Monday afternoon “saw some of the heaviest shelling in Gaza so far.”Two experts in the laws of war said they had not seen significant changes in recent days in how Israel was waging its war in Gaza, largely because its warnings to civilians to move out of harm’s way appeared ineffective and the scope of its campaign made it unclear if anywhere in Gaza was truly safe.“I don’t have the sense that the renewed Israeli operations are significantly different than the earlier operations in terms of seeking to minimize the risk of harm to civilians,” Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser at the State Department and now a senior adviser for the U.S. program at the International Crisis Group, said.Since Israel resumed its bombing campaign, with a new focus on southern Gaza, much of its new effort to protect civilians revolves around its publication on Friday of an online map that divides Gaza into hundreds of tiny sectors. In the days since, military officials have posted on social media about which sectors Gazans need to evacuate and where they should go.Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesman, said on Monday that while it was too early to make definitive assessments, the United States saw signs that Israel was implementing changes the two sides had discussed to limit civilian casualties, including reducing mass displacement.Before Israeli forces invaded northern Gaza in late October, Mr. Miller said, they issued a blanket order for the northern region — which had been home to more than a million people — to evacuate their homes. The publication of the map represented “a much more targeted request for evacuations” that was “an improvement on what’s happened before.”But the evacuation orders have confused Gazans, many of whom cannot access the map or Israel’s posted instructions because they have no electricity and poor to nonexistent internet and cellphone service. Some who have followed the orders have found themselves in already overcrowded areas without shelter or toilets.Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, said that warnings were an important way to protect civilians from armed conflict and that a more precise map was more helpful in principle than broad evacuation orders. But he said Israel’s new system was not much better that what had preceded it.“There is no reliably safe way to go and no reliably safe place in Gaza, period, so even if they tell you this area is relatively safe, the airstrikes continue to hit virtually all parts of Gaza,” he said.Also endangering civilians, Mr. Shakir said, was Israel’s continued use of bombs and heavy artillery in densely populated areas, a tactic under which “the risk of civilian death is amplified.” In addition, he said, Israel was still bringing down entire apartment blocks without making clear what the military objectives of such strikes were.U.S. officials said they had privately urged Israel to use smaller bombs to collapse Hamas’s tunnel network, but it was not clear that Israeli forces were doing so. An Israeli military spokesman, Peter Lerner, told reporters on Tuesday that he was “not aware of any limitations on the ability to utilize our firepower.”Israel has said that its war seeks to destroy Hamas and that its forces make great efforts to protect civilians. It blames the extent of destruction in Gaza on Hamas, saying its fighters mix in with the civilian population, effectively using them as human shields, and fight from civilian areas.The health authorities in Gaza say that more than 15,000 people have been killed since the start of the war. While they do not distinguish between civilians and fighters, they say that most of the dead are women and children.Matthew Mpoke Bigg contributed reporting.— Ben HubbardWhen Dr. Yael Mozer-Glassberg, a senior physician at Schneider Children’s Medical Center of Israel, was initially asked to join the team of people who would be responsible for the intake of child hostages returning to Israel, her internal reaction was immediate.“Oh my God, no,” she recalled saying to herself. “But how could I say no? It’s a national mission. I was very, very, very honored they picked me.”She joined a group of medical professionals in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, who were recruited to be among the first caretakers that a group of children and their mothers would see upon returning to Israel. During the cease-fire, which lasted from Nov. 24 to Dec. 1, the hospital admitted 19 children and 6 women who were kidnapped on Oct. 7 by Hamas and other militant groups.To the initial surprise of many, the children were quick to speak freely about their experiences. Social workers and psychologists listened intently as they told stories with a voice that barely reached a whisper.One child said he kept track of time by tearing off pieces of his fingernails and saving the clippings to count the days. Dr. Efrat Bron-Harlev, the director of Schneider Children’s Medical Center of Israel, said another child asked a flurry of questions: “Are we allowed to look out the window? Are we allowed to open the door? Can we walk outside the room?” Another child said she was confused to see people waiting for her. She said she was told that no one was looking for her, no one cared for her, and that there would be no Israel left for her.At times, the social worker or psychologist would step out of the room to cry.“They spoke about death as if they’re going down to the grocery and speaking about which ice cream they will buy,” said Dr. Bron-Harlev.She had long planned on how her hospital would welcome the children. Just over a week after Oct. 7, she emailed the Ministry of Health with a subject line that read: “Let’s think about optimistic days when the children will come back from captivity.”She began building a team that resembled an entire new ward. She did not know if any hostages had undergone sexual trauma, she said, so she decided to create a team mostly made up of women. She did not know if anyone would return with acute physical trauma, so she placed a team on call that included the head of the intensive care unit, the head of anesthesiology, the head of the surgical team and the head of orthopedics.Dr. Bron-Harlev then built a small inner circle that included senior doctors and nurses, social workers and psychologists, hospital support staff and kitchen staff. Food could be a big issue, she thought. What would they be able to stomach, and what would they want?When children arrived, some with their mother and siblings who were also held in captivity, they were greeted slowly. First, they reunited with their families. Later, the medical teams approached each child and mother delicately.“We took it slowly, one step in, two steps out, to see what their needs were,” said Efrat Harel, the director of social services at Schneider. Each patient was assigned a doctor, a nurse, a social worker and a psychologist.Families were told they could stay in the hospital as long as they wanted. Many stayed for at least three or four nights, pacing themselves as children started doing seemingly normal things, like asking for their favorite foods.At one in the morning, the second night during one child’s stay at the hospital, a request was made for schnitzel.— Talya Minsberg Reporting from Tel AvivA spokesman for Israeli forces on Tuesday estimated that the number of Hamas fighters killed in Gaza during the war stood at several thousand, detailing a range of assumptions that went into the assessment.The estimate factors into a broader debate about the use of force during almost 60 days of Israeli missile strikes on the territory and a ground invasion launched on Oct. 27. A high proportion of Hamas fighters among the dead would mean fewer civilians were among the overall toll, which the health authorities in Gaza put at more than 15,500. The ministry, which is run by Hamas, says that more than two-thirds of those killed were women and children.The spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, addressing an online briefing for journalists, said the Israel Defense Forces arrived at the estimate of “several thousands” of killed combatants based on “the accumulation of data and information that we’re receiving from the field and from our after-action review.”On Monday, a senior Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity under army rules, told reporters that the Gazan ministry’s estimate of 15,000 total deaths was roughly accurate but that at least 5,000 people killed in Gaza were combatants, rather than civilians.While any loss of civilian life is regrettable, the senior official said, a ratio of two civilians killed for every combatant was reasonable, given the complex urban environment in which the fighting was taking place and that Hamas, as a matter of strategy, operates from densely packed civilian areas.But Colonel Lerner said that number was not official, and that Israel had not arrived at an official number for Hamas combatants killed.Colonel Lerner explained some elements of how the military had reached the estimate of several thousands. He said, for example, that if Israeli troops believed they had wiped out a Hamas battalion, officials would estimate that between 200 and 250 Hamas fighters had been killed.He added that if a battalion commander was targeted and killed, the military would estimate that a team of five or six people had died with the commander. Confirmation that a commander had been killed could take days to arrive, he said, so the estimate was an “evolving reality.”A starting point in determining whether a person was a fighter was whether they were “holding an AK-47 in jeans and sandals,” he said.Experts said in late November that the pace of deaths in the conflict appears to have few precedents in wars this century. Colonel Lerner said that warfare is a “very tragic reality.”— Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Isabel KershnerDozens of women, children and teenagers being held hostage in Gaza were freed during a weeklong cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Now that the truce has collapsed and fighting has resumed, relatives of the men still in captivity fear their loved ones will be forgotten.Since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks, Israelis have rallied by the thousands for the return of the roughly 240 hostages taken during the assault. Negotiations for a hostage swap in exchange for Palestinian prisoners were centered from the beginning on women, children and teenagers, eventually leading to the release of 105 hostages.That leaves more than 100 men among the people believed to still be held in Gaza.“As soon as you leave just men behind, somehow it matters less to people,” said Tomer Or, 29, whose 30-year-old brother Avinatan is still held. “The headline is less attention-grabbing.”Ms. Or’s brother was taken hostage at an outdoor music festival along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, 25. Both are among the 137 hostages still in captivity — 117 of whom are male, according to Israeli officials.Ms. Or said that like all Israelis she celebrated the return of those who have been freed, but that the emphasis on children and women in negotiations sent the wrong message.“The government is responsible to care for all of its citizens equally,” Ms. Or said. “It cannot ignore men. They aren’t second-class citizens.”Negotiations for releases of the remaining men collapsed with the two sides unable to agree on how to differentiate between soldiers and civilians, according to Israeli officials. At 18, most Israeli men must serve in the military for just under three years, after which some continue reporting periodically for reserve duty until their early 40s.Ms. Or’s brother, Avinatan, is not an active duty soldier. He is an electrical engineer who builds computer chips.The male hostages will be a sticking point in any future negotiations, said Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist who played a key role in the negotiations that led to the 2011 release of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was held captive for five years.Not only does Hamas expect Israel to release high-profile Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the men, but they also want a complete cease-fire and a withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, Mr. Baskin said. This is a price Israel is not willing to pay, he said.“Right now, I don’t see any way of getting them back,” he added.Ilay David, 29, whose 22-year-old brother Evyatar was kidnapped on Oct. 7, was trying to remain optimistic. He said it hurts to think that people like his brother, a shift manager at a restaurant, must continue waiting, but he takes solace in the fact that a deal happened in the first place, and he is now more confident that the Israeli government would be open to negotiating another deal.He said it had motivated him to continue participating in rallies to press for the release of the remaining hostages.“I understand the process will be long and painful,” he said, but “I don’t have a choice but to stay hopeful and to continue what I’m doing.”— Adam Sella reporting from Tel AvivAmong the 240 Palestinian prisoners and detainees released during the weeklong cease-fires between Israel and Hamas were 15 women who stood apart from the others: They were citizens of Israel.The women are part of Israel’s Arab minority. Most were arrested after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and charged based on their social media posts with identifying with a terrorist organization. None of them had been convicted of a crime, and all but one opposed being released as part of the deal, preferring to defend themselves in court, according to interviews with one of the women and three lawyers involved in their cases.But in the end, those 14 of the 15 were released against their will, the lawyers said, leaving them confused about their legal status and scared of living with the stigma of being linked to a group that most Israelis consider an abhorrent terrorist organization.“Socially, it is very problematic,” said Nareman Shehadeh Zoabi, an attorney at Adalah, an Israeli minority rights group, who is representing one of the women. “We anticipate that there is going to be a very complex situation socially for them after being included in this agreement, and we are starting to see examples here and there.”Some of the women have already paid a price for their inclusion in the deal. Gunshots were fired near the home of one of them, and many are worried they could be attacked on the street.Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology, expelled one of the women, who had been studying computer science.“It’s very clear: Someone who was released as part of a hostage deal with Hamas cannot study here,” said Doron Shaham, a university spokeswoman.About one-fifth of Israelis are Arabs whose families were living in what would become Israel before the state was founded in 1948. Unlike the Palestinian refugees who ended up in the West Bank, Gaza and neighboring Arab countries, this group remained in Israel and received citizenship.While they carry Israeli passports, vote and can exercise other civil rights, many Israeli-Arabs accuse Israel of treating them as second-class citizens and sympathize with Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and around the Middle East.The Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 killed more than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and saw 240 others taken back to Gaza as captives, according to Israeli officials. Israel responded by launching a vast military campaign in Gaza against Hamas, which controls the enclave. The health authorities there say the military campaign has killed more than 15,000 people, mostly women and children.As the war escalated, most of the 15 women made social media posts that led to their arrest.One woman shared a joke about capturing a female soldier and a post that said, “Where were the people calling for humanity when we were killed?” over photos of Palestinian children, according to screenshots viewed by The New York Times.Another woman added a beating heart emoji to a post that read “Gaza today” with a photo of Palestinians riding on a captured Israeli military vehicle and shared a photo of Palestinians breaking through a hole in the Gaza border fence on Oct. 7 with text that read: “While the army that can’t be beat was sleeping.”Those two women and 12 others were arrested and charged with identifying with a terror group and other charges. Another woman in the group had been detained earlier on charges including attempted murder and identifying with a terrorist group, but had not been convicted of any crimes.On Nov. 24, Israel and Hamas agreed to the first of several cease-fires that would last a week and allow the release of 105 hostages from Gaza, mostly women and children, in exchange for 240 Palestinian women and minors held by Israel.Most of the Palestinians released were from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but the list also included the 15 Israeli citizens.Ms. Zoabi, the lawyer, said that Israel had long avoided allowing its Arab citizens to be represented by Palestinian groups like Hamas in such agreements and that it was not clear why the government had acted differently this time.David Becker, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, declined to comment on the women’s release.The government did not ask the women or their lawyers if they wanted to be included in the deal nor did it respond to their lawyers’ requests to keep them out of it, Ms. Zoabi said. Like the other lawyers interviewed, Ms. Zoabi had wanted to defend her client in court for acts she called “definitely in the borders of her freedom of expression.”The women and their lawyers also worried that being released under a deal negotiated by Hamas could damage their client’s lives.“I wrote that my client does not want to be released from the deal with Hamas,” said Ahmad Massalha, another lawyer representing one of the women. “Being labeled as affiliated with Hamas is worse than any punishment that the court would have given.”One of the women, who spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons, said she was arrested for posts that the Israeli authorities considered sympathetic to Hamas. During her interrogation, she said, she told police that she opposed Hamas and that she was against any killing of civilians.A few weeks later, she said, she was released and only learned that she had been included in a deal brokered by Hamas after she had reached home.She was horrified, she said.“I kept thinking, ‘How can I convince people that I’m not supporting Hamas after being part of this deal?’” she said.— Ben Hubbard and Natan OdenheimerThe war in Gaza and the polarization it is causing internationally are creating a major risk of terrorist attacks in the European Union over the December holiday season, Ylva Johansson, the bloc’s commissioner for home affairs, said on Tuesday.The warning was a reflection of how in Europe, which in recent years has been shaken by terrorist attacks, anger over Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre in Israel and the Israeli military’s increasingly deadly retaliation in Gaza has created new risks.Ms. Johansson did not mention specific threats, but noted a stabbing on Saturday in Paris, where a German tourist was killed by a man whom the French authorities said had psychiatric disorders and was upset over the deaths of Muslims, including in Gaza.Ms. Johansson said that the European Union would make available an additional 30 million euros for protection from terror threats, including for places of worship.A European Commission official who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the issue publicly said that the warning was prompted by the spread of terror-related material online, by recent attacks or attempted attacks in European countries and by the decisions by multiple E.U. countries to raise their terrorism alert levels. The official added that authorities are watching for both antisemitic and anti-Muslim violence because of the war.In October, a 6-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death outside Chicago in an attack that authorities called a hate crime tied to the war in Gaza.In a report published before the war in Gaza began in October, Europol, the European police office, said that terrorism continued to pose a serious threat in Europe and that member states viewed jihadist terrorism as the most prominent threat. White extremists have also perpetrated attacks in Europe in recent years.Christmas holiday events where large groups gather have been targets, such as in Berlin in 2016, when 12 people were killed in a terrorist attack at a Christmas market.Bibi van Ginkel, an expert at the International Center for Counter-Terrorism in the Netherlands, said that tensions were rising because of the war in Gaza, which she said could have a trigger effect on people who were already sympathetic to extremist ideology.“All of the sudden because of the events,” she said, “they may feel that they themselves have a duty to act and have a right to act.”— Emma BubolaKhan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, was densely populated before the war, and it has become more crowded as people have fled the north to escape Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion.Even before Israeli forces said on Tuesday that they were fighting in “the heart” of the city, conditions there were grim, with little access to running water or sanitation. People sleep in the open, and aid workers have largely stopped distributing water and flour because of the intensity of the fighting and Israeli bombardments, U.N. officials have said.Khan Younis had more than 200,000 residents before the war began on Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities. The city, whose history stretches back centuries, is now made up largely of apartment blocks set a couple of miles back from the sea.Before the conflict, nearly 90,000 people were registered at the Khan Younis refugee camp, one of eight run by the United Nations in Gaza. The camps were initially set up to receive many of the 750,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the Arab-Israeli war in 1948, which broke out when five Arab nations invaded after Israel declared independence.These camps have since become permanent communities for the refugees and their descendants, and the Khan Younis camp is in practice part of the wider metropolitan area.“Life for nearly all refugees in the camp has become increasingly difficult because of the blockade on Gaza, which has caused a dramatic deterioration of socioeconomic conditions, including ever-growing unemployment and poverty rates,” the U.N. agency that assists Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said.The agency said that basic hygiene was a big concern even before the current war with Hamas, “with 90 percent of the camp’s water supply being unfit for human consumption.”Israel is trying to eliminate Hamas, the Palestinian group that runs Gaza, and it says that some of the group’s leaders are hiding out in Khan Younis. Israel issued evacuation orders on Sunday that it said were for civilians’ safety. But the orders are particularly hard to follow in a place that has become packed with displaced people.In one example, 22,000 people have taken refuge at a training center in the city that is designed to shelter one-tenth of that number, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.— Matthew Mpoke BiggThe presidents of three of the country’s top universities — Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. — defended themselves against accusations that they had allowed their campuses to be swept by a tide of antisemitism, in testimony before a congressional committee on Tuesday.Claudine Gay of Harvard, Elizabeth Magill of Penn and Sally Kornbluth of M.I.T. testified before the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce about what they acknowledged was antisemitic, and also Islamophobic, behavior on their campuses since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and Israel’s subsequent invasion of Gaza.Dr. Gay said that the balance between allowing protests and protecting against antisemitism has been tricky.“I have sought to confront hate while preserving free expression,” Dr. Gay said. “This is difficult work, and I know that I have not always gotten it right.”But the presidents, who are all fairly new to their jobs, said they also had made many efforts to aid Jewish students, including denunciations of the attack, beefed-up security and the formation of task forces to fight antisemitism on campus.“We have reiterated that speech that incites violence, threatens safety, or violates Harvard’s policies against bullying and harassment is unacceptable,” Dr. Gay said in her opening statement. “We have made it clear that any behaviors that disrupt our teaching and research efforts will not be tolerated; and where these lines have been crossed, we have taken action.”The committee signaled from the outset that the hearing would be combative, sending out a news release under the headline, “College Presidents to Answer for Mishandling of Antisemitic, Violent Protests.”In an interview before the hearing, the committee chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, said the three presidents had been called to testify because “we heard in particular that the most egregious situations have occurred on these campuses.” Another president, Minouche Shafik, of Columbia University, had been invited to testify but declined because of a scheduling conflict, an aide to Representative Foxx said.“What I would like to get from them is a clear statement that they’re going to grow some spine and speak out on behalf of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, and against antisemitism and threats being made to these students,” Representative Foxx said in the interview. “That’s what I want to hear. I think that’s what America wants to hear.”A November survey by Hillel and the Anti-Defamation League found that after the Hamas attack on Israel, 46 percent of Jewish students felt safe, compared with 67 percent before the attack.And after the attack, 44 percent of Jewish students viewed their university as welcoming and supportive, as opposed to before the attack, when 64 percent of Jewish students felt so.Anecdotally, Jewish students have said they have agonized over whether to hide symbols of their Jewish identity, like a star of David necklace or a kipa on their heads. Some students said they had been afraid to leave their dorm rooms.At the same time, the Council on American-Islamic Relations is reporting a sharp increase in bias attacks against Muslims. Last month, three college students of Palestinian descent were shot in Burlington, Vt., which police are investigating as a possible hate crime. And Muslim students and pro-Palestinian students have been doxxed, having their names and photographs disseminated on mobile billboards attached to trucks under the legend, for instance, “Harvard’s Leading Antisemites.”The federal Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has launched investigations into complaints of discrimination against Harvard and Penn. Title VI of the civil rights act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race or national origin. Since 2004, the Office for Civil Rights has interpreted that to include shared ethnic or ancestral background, regardless of whether a group also has shared religious beliefs or practices.— Anemona HartocollisThe Biden administration is imposing visa bans on dozens of Israeli settlers who have committed acts of violence in the West Bank, taking action against what U.S. officials call a potential trigger for wider violence as Israel wages war in Gaza.In a statement on Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken announced a new policy “targeting individuals believed to have been involved in undermining peace, security or stability in the West Bank, including through committing acts of violence or taking other actions that unduly restrict civilians’ access to essential services and basic necessities.”U.S. officials are most concerned about a recent surge in attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians, but the new policy will also deny entry to Palestinians who have committed violent acts against Israelis. Under State Department privacy rules, the names of the people who will be designated in the coming days will not be made public.The restrictions may also be extended to their immediate family members, Mr. Blinken said.The move comes as the United States tries to revive efforts to achieve a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after the current Gaza conflict is over, in the hopes of breaking the cycle of violence between the two sides. Any two-state solution would require Israel’s government to rein in right-wing West Bank settlers, who oppose the creation of a Palestinian state.Extremist settler violence has spiked recently, and Palestinians and many analysts say that Israel’s government has allowed the often heavily armed settlers to operate with impunity. Attacks on Palestinians, meant to drive them from their homes, had reached their highest recorded levels even before the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks — and have only accelerated since then.“Instability in the West Bank both harms the Israeli and Palestinian people and threatens Israel’s national security interests,” Mr. Blinken said in his statement.President Biden and Mr. Blinken have pressed Israeli officials to take stronger action against West Bank settlers, with Mr. Blinken warning of the upcoming measures during his visit to Israel last week.In a daily press briefing, the State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said the first visa bans would be enacted on Tuesday. Designated Israeli citizens who currently have visas to enter the United States will be notified that their visas have been revoked, he said. Any other settlers without current visas will see their applications to obtain one rejected.But the new action would have no effect on West Bank settlers who are dual Israeli-American citizens and thus do not require visas to enter the United States.In late October, Mr. Biden said that settler attacks on Palestinians were like “pouring gasoline on the fire.”The settlers are “attacking Palestinians in places that they’re entitled to be,” Mr. Biden said, calling for “accountability.”Mr. Miller told reporters that the United States remained unsatisfied and had not seen “a sufficient level of action by the government of Israel that we think hold people properly accountable.”Israeli officials have taken some steps, he said, including putting offenders in administrative detention. But the United States believes that more settlers should be criminally prosecuted.Mr. Miller noted that the new action aims to punish not only acts of violence against people but also those against property, as well as “undue restrictions on civilians’ access to essential services and basic necessities.”The Biden administration announced in September that it would begin allowing Israelis to enter the United States without a visa under what is known as a visa waiver program. But Israelis must still apply to enter the country under a streamlined program known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. Mr. Miller said blacklisted Israelis would find those applications rejected as well as any visa applications they might submit.— Michael Crowley Reporting from WashingtonReporting inside Gaza is extremely challenging right now. Israel has prevented journalists from entering the region except when accompanied by its military, and then only under certain conditions, while Egypt, along its border, is also blocking access. Communications have been limited, in part because of the Israeli siege of the enclave. Many Palestinian journalists in Gaza have been killed in airstrikes. And even before the war, Hamas restricted what reporters could cover in Gaza, limiting their movement, interrogating their sources and translators and expelling foreign reporters for work deemed objectionable.The Times, along with other news organizations, has asked the governments of Israel and Egypt for direct access to Gaza because reporting on the ground is vital to understanding this crisis. Throughout the war, The Times has been working with journalists who were already in Gaza when the siege began. We have been interviewing residents and officials in Gaza by phone and using digital apps. We have asked people in the area to share their stories with us on video, which we then confirm are real. We also verify photos and social media posts using similar techniques, scrutinizing them to determine where and when they were taken or written and cross-checking with other sources, such as satellite imagery. We cross reference any information we gather with interviews with the U.N. and other international organizations, many of which have employees in different parts of Gaza.In general, we try to avoid relying on a single source and we seek to include detailed information whenever possible.— The New York TimesThe U.S. agency responsible for distributing international aid on Tuesday pledged an additional $21 million to help Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continued spiraling toward a public health disaster.Samantha Power, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, announced the new tranche of aid on Tuesday after arriving in El-Arish, Egypt, amid renewed fighting in Gaza and deteriorating living conditions for its 2.2 million people.“Civilians are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the war, and food, water, and fuel remain inadequate, and that is unconscionable,” Ms. Power said at a news conference in El-Arish. “Every country has to do everything in its power to facilitate as much lifesaving assistance to Gaza as possible.”The aid announced on Tuesday, which adds to the $100 million in aid announced by President Biden on Oct. 18, will help supply food, shelter, medical care and other necessities, Ms. Power said. The circumstances in Gaza are dire, aid groups have said, with shortages of food, water and medical equipment and poor hygiene conditions that have intensified the spread of respiratory and waterborne illnesses.,Although a brief pause in fighting allowed for increased aid and fuel to enter the territory, humanitarian aid organizations have said it’s not enough.Ms. Power said that during the seven day cease-fire last week, around 250 trucks of aid and at least 26,000 gallons of fuel entered the enclave per day — more than what had entered during the entire previous month. She added that one focus of her trip would be to expedite the delivery and inspection processes.“The levels of aid reached during the pause need to be the bare minimum of what goes in going forward,” she said.Ms. Power also announced on Tuesday that an additional 36,000 pounds of medical supplies, warm clothing and food was airlifted into Egypt by the Department of Defense. The department also airlifted 54,000 pounds of supplies on Nov. 28 to be transported and distributed in Gaza by the United Nations, a Pentagon spokesman said. The agency also said on Tuesday that the United States recently delivered 500,000 pounds of food assistance to Gaza.Ms. Power said that humanitarian assistance was a “top tier” priority for President Biden.The United States provides $3.8 billion to Israel in military assistance each year, more than it assists any other nation.The Biden administration has requested $14.3 billion for Israel’s war effort as part of a national security package that also includes more than $9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Palestinian and Israeli civilians, and also those in Ukraine.Over the last two weeks, the Biden administration has urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties as it continued its airstrike campaign in Gaza. And since the cease-fire collapsed late last week, U.S. officials have said that the Israeli military forces appeared to be taking additional precautions to protect civilians.But some experts in the laws of war have seen little change in Israel’s campaign, and the death toll in Gaza in recent days — more than 300 people killed each day between Saturday and Monday, according to figures released by Gazan health officials — resembled that of earlier in the conflict.Ben Hubbard, Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Karoun Demirjian contributed reporting.— Gaya GuptaA State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said on Monday that Hamas had “reneged” on an agreement to release all the women it was holding hostage, and that the group’s officials “were never able to provide a credible reason why.”“We hope they will change their mind and release those women,” he said at a news conference in Washington.Under the agreement negotiated with Israel via mediators in Qatar, and with the input of the United States, Hamas was supposed to release all women and minors among the roughly 240 hostages taken in the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in southern Israel, in exchange for a continuation of a pause of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, Mr. Miller said. As part of the agreement, Israel released Palestinian women and minors it had jailed and allowed more trucks carrying fuel and humanitarian aid, including medical supplies, to enter Gaza.Hamas released dozens of women, minors and children during the seven-day pause, but not all of the female hostages who Israeli officials believe are still alive.“They broke the deal” and “came up with excuses why,” Mr. Miller said. “Ultimately, I don’t think any of the excuses were credible, and I shouldn’t get into any of them here.”In an exchange with a reporter for The Associated Press, Mr. Miller said one reason “a number of people believe they refused to release them is they didn’t want people to hear what those women would have to say publicly.” When pressed by the reporter, Mr. Miller said that he was just voicing speculation and was “not able to speak with a definitive assessment that that is the case.”Earlier in the news conference, Mr. Miller addressed a different reporter’s question on why he had not condemned rape by Hamas.“We haven’t made an independent assessment,” he said. “We’ve obviously seen the reports that Hamas has committed sexual violence, they’ve committed rape. We have no reason at all to doubt those reports.”Before the pause and daily releases of hostages broke down last Friday, Hamas had floated the idea of swaps for more Palestinians held in Israeli jails, including high-profile detainees. But Israeli officials had insisted to Hamas that they wanted all women and children held in Gaza released before they would discuss further exchanges.Zaher Jabareen, a Hamas official who oversees prisoner issues, told a Times reporter last week that Hamas considered some of the women on Israel’s proposed list of hostages for release to be soldiers.He said Hamas made several proposals, all of which were rejected by Israel.— Edward

CNN,Video shows man in military fatigues shooting mentally disabled Palestinian in West Bank,2023-12-05 19:33:00,Kareem Khadder,"A video reviewed by CNN Tuesday shows a man in military fatigues shooting and wounding a mentally disabled Palestinian near the occupied West Bank city of Hebron.Tarek Abu Abed, known to friends and family as “Ghazzawi,” was on his way home Tuesday when he was stopped by three men in military fatigues and asked for identification, Tarek’s brother Diaa Abu Abed told CNN by telephone on Tuesday.“Anybody who meets Tarek can tell immediately he has special needs,” Diaa Abu Abed said. “His brain works like a child’s does.”When Tarek Abu Abed told the men that he did not have identification, an argument ensued that culminated in Tarek being shot, according to his brother.Diaa Abu Abed identified the men who stopped his brother as Israeli soldiers.While some Israeli settlers are also known to wear military fatigues and have access to military assault rifles, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later confirmed to CNN that Israeli soldiers had been involved in a confrontation with a mentally disabled man near Hebron on Tuesday and said its Military Police were investigating the encounter.“Based on the initial information available, it appears that during a check that was conducted earlier today near the city of Hebron, a Palestinian was shot in the leg and was evacuated to receive medical treatment,” the IDF said in a statement.CNN geolocated the incident to near the town of Sidet Qalqas, south of Hebron.The video, which is filmed down a street from the incident, appears to show the moments after Tarek said he did not have identification. It shows three men in military fatigues standing over a man who is on his hands and knees, and next to a man in a red shirt, identified by Diaa as Tarek’s friend.“The man in the video wearing red came to defend him to tell the Israeli soldiers that my brother has special needs,” Diaa Abu Abed said. “He’s known amongst the community for his mental disabilities. The soldiers refused to listen.”The men had their rifles aimed at Tarek Abu Abed, and shouting can be heard. Abu Abed appears to be attempting to stand up as several local residents look on. He then stands up and approaches one of the men, seemingly agitated. A second man then approaches Abu Abed from behind.A gunshot rings out, and Abu Abed collapses to the ground. He writhes in pain, as two of the men continue to point their weapons at him.Diaa Abu Abed said that an onlooker called him, and he arrived on the scene soon after.The Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a statement on Tuesday that it had transported a 34-year-old man with a bullet wound in his leg from Qalqas to the hospital.Tarek Abu Abed suffered heavy bleeding and has undergone surgery on his leg, his brother said.The Israel-Hamas war has increasingly spilled over into the West Bank with settler attacks and clashes leaving hundreds of Palestinians dead.At least 256 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or Israeli settlers in the West Bank and east Jerusalem since October 7, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.",3032,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/middleeast/mentally-disabled-man-shot-west-bank/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205153917-military-fatigues-shoot-mentally-disabled-man-120523.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,refuse palestinian town medical shoot transport mental clash stand suffer leave child attack home ghazzawi community troop tarek crescent abed immediately ministry initial bleeding friend family fatigue bank collapse treatment soldier sidet resident agitate pain scene confrontation aim settler evacuate brother told cnn hand conduct culminate ring available palestine wear video city spill investigate israel accord heavy local force ground argument special east society shirt october incident statement identify shot weapon west diaa confirm arrive information south street abu hebron continue defend today approach access film gunshot leg military review ensue rifle stop receive geolocated onlooker identification meet writhes disability knee mentally base health qalqas check defense earlier hundred kill telephone call point wound red moment jerusalem shout attempt undergone disabled surgery idf israeli assault heard occupy bullet involve seemingly work show brain increasingly police tuesday,-0.9843,0.1978891820580474,9.694010507880911,0.2259920634920635,0,2023-12-05
CNN,‘No one will remember us’: India’s hero ‘rat hole miners’ who helped rescue 41 men from the Himalayan tunnel,2023-12-05 19:14:00,not specified,"Just a few pieces of debris stood between Munna Qureshi and dozens of laborers who his team had been tasked with rescuing from deep inside a Himalayan tunnel after all previous attempts to free them had failed.“I could hear the laborers gasping on the other side with excitement,” the 29-year-old said. “My heart was racing as I removed the last rock between us.”Qureshi is among 12 specialized workers who were called by Indian authorities to help with last month’s rescue of 41 construction workers trapped in the collapsed tunnel in northern Uttarakhand state.For nearly three weeks the construction workers were cut off from the world, some 60 meters inside the mountain, receiving food and air through a thin tube and frequent updates from rescuers outside.Engineers worked round the clock to drill a safe passage through the broken rock using a state of the art machine, while officials flew in experts to help with rescue efforts. But ultimately, after 17 days, it was Qureshi and his colleagues who succeeded in bringing the men to safety after the drill broke beyond repair just meters from the trapped workers.Known locally as “rat hole miners”, they belong to a niche group of highly skilled, but poorly paid excavators who typically crawl through narrow tunnels to extract coal from deep within the ground.It is a profession so dangerous it has been banned in some parts of the country. But it has been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks, and the men celebrated as heroes by many across the country.“Rat hole mining may be illegal,” Lt General Syed Ata Hasnain, a retired official from India’s National Disaster Management Authority told reporters shortly after the rescue. “But a rat miner’s talent and experience is not.”Workers employed in the dangerous profession are among the most vulnerable and marginalized in India, hence the unflattering local moniker. Mostly migrants from some of India’s poorest states, they are paid about $5 for a day’s work, according to local reports.Slimly built and nimble, they are expected to enter tiny crevices in mines, often deprived of oxygen and at risk of being buried under loose soil.Most coal mining in India takes place in northeastern Meghalaya state, home to some of the country’s largest coal deposits, amounting to more than 576 million metric tons.Rat hole mining was banned in the state by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2014 due to health and environmental risks, but it’s still carried out illegally in secluded pockets of the region.According to Hasina Kharbhih, the founder of Impulse, a non-profit that advocates for the safety of these workers, an estimated 225 “rat hole miners” died between 2007 and 2014, before the practice was banned.In 2018, four years after the ban was implemented, another 15 died after becoming trapped in an illegal coal mine for two weeks.“This number however is the tip of the iceberg,” Kharbhih said. “I am sure if other regions where this happened were thoroughly researched, these numbers would go up.”Most of the men called to rescue the laborers said they knew the risks when they joined the profession.“I always thought this job would take my life someday,” one of the workers, Nasir Khan, said. “I never thought it would earn me respect.”However, retired judge B.P. Katoki, who set up the tribunal that banned rat mining in Meghalaya, said India shouldn’t “normalize” such a dangerous profession.“It was a last effort to rescue the lives of 41 people, so an argument can be made that it was necessary,” he told CNN. “But that does not mean one celebrates the practice. That has dangerous implications.”Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami announced 50,000 rupees ($600) will be handed out among the workers as a token of appreciation. But some of the “rat miners” said they are still waiting for details of the compensation.And despite the media attention, they said they had not been thanked or rewarded by the authorities.Just two hours after the men were rescued, a list of 90 men who took part in the effort was circulated by an Uttarakhand government official on a media WhatsApp group. Conspicuously missing were the names of the 12 “rat miners” who put their lives on the line to complete that final breakthrough.“This does not surprise me,” said Mohammad Irshad Ansari, one of the “rat miner” workers. “A laborer is and will only be seen as a laborer. Whatever we may have done, it does not change that we are poor.”CNN has contacted the Uttarakhand government for comment about the compensation.One of the men, Monu Kumar, said he received a hero’s welcome when he arrived home in northern Uttar Pradesh state.“There was music playing, we were garlanded, and my family and neighbours distributed 30 kilograms worth of sweets to everyone,” he said.“People (in the village) are saying that we did so much, put our life on the line, but we did not get anything in return.”To get to the trapped workers, the “rat miners” had to crawl through an 80-centimeter (2.6 feet) diameter pipe inserted into the debris, crouch for hours in the small space and dig through the final 12 meters (about 40 feet) of rubble with their bare hands.Khan said it was “unlike anything we have ever seen before.”“It was not just debris, stone, or a mountain; there were steel pipes, water, and ropes in there. We used many tools to slowly get them out,” he added.Two “rat miners” went in at a time on rotating four-hour shifts, with one cutting the stone and the other pulling the debris out of the pipe.“It was difficult. It was risky,” said Kumar. “There is no doubt about that.”Ansari wants to keep going to rescue more men should the situation arise, but Khan’s family has urged him to quit his job, saying the risk is not worth the low pay.Despite working for three decades in the industry, he cannot afford to send his three children to school.“This work is also seasonal. We do not have it in summer months as access to oxygen is a problem, and in monsoons as the water makes it unsafe,” he said. “By working for only four months in a year, how can I afford to send my children to school? I did not go to school and nor will they.”Kumar feels the media attention won’t last long.“Soon, these calls will stop coming,” he said. “No one is going to remember us.”",6280,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/india/india-uttarakhand-rat-miners-rescue-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205142349-rat-miners-india-1127.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,side round built token change national extract doubt illegally hour piece steel child pradesh home effort worker time hero group employ happen tool mohammad situation lt crawl deep unlike uttar family ansari rescue kilogram stone whatsapp remember india free remove profession munna set pipe normalize rescuer broke seclude arise music water accord ngt himalayan despite country judge founder village month hear miss ultimately announce mountain pull hasnain knew bring narrow celebrates dhami bury neighbour risk comment northern gasp irshad send indian art drill belong advocate afford khan excitement foot receive stop miner experience rope dangerous diameter locally medium shift poorly sweet insert number small passage health general complete implement world environmental day previous attempt hole monsoon large northeastern vulnerable disaster safe kharbhih thin make machine thanked impulse oxygen enter practice feel wait job urge dozen ban katoki expert singh iceberg nasir update due authority safety conspicuously decade talent rotate industry mining marginalize migrant contact earn million specialized uttarakhand pocket tube collapse tribunal highly seasonal space moniker skilled meghalaya trap laborer difficult research rubble retire deprive told year state cnn hand join inside amount rat kumar region tunnel rock succeed race unflattering stood construction monu pushkar official paid detail heart crevice low carry expect local hasina argument loose illegal garland team risky final thrust recent circulate excavator surprise coal life meter welcome air cut government line debris arrive syed flew problem shortly colleague place attention clock deposit rupee nimble access reporter food repair minister poorest slowly tasked broken list worth unsafe part frequent appreciation summer chief management ata quit typically call reward someday crouch metric green spotlight tip school distribute put qureshi niche celebrate estimate work play week tiny,-0.1344,0.8121019108280254,7.850906225374306,0.4560626960943417,0,2023-12-05

The bus smashed onto a concrete railing then fell into the ravine, officials said.“The driver was repeatedly sounding his horn because he had apparently lost control of the bus before it plummeted into the ravine,” Ronniel Pabustan, an Antique provincial crisis responder, told The Associated Press by telephone, citing accounts by some of the passengers.Dozens of rescuers, including police, army troops and provincial emergency responders, worked to extricate the victims from the wreckage. They used stretchers and ropes to bring the victims up the ravine in an hourslong rescue and retrieval work that dragged late into the night, Pabustan said.“It’s so tragic and painful because this happened close to Christmas,” Pabustan said, adding that among the dead was a baby, who remained unidentified.The search for victims ended overnight but provincial officials urged village leaders to alert emergency personnel if they find any more victims in the site of the accident, a thickly wooded area in the bottom of the ravine.",1622,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/16-dead-12-injured-passenger-bus-falls-off-105406304,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,urge emergency dead account town apparently plunge painful central lose fell night troop happen negotiate manila deep curve late rescue find afternoon ravine driver told rescuer plummet accident passenger baby thickly official injure local road village crisis victim condition mountain philippine area bring stretcher downhill close associate bottom include sound responder drag remain army concrete site christmas search wreckage rope repeatedly smash ronniel control provincial press wooded extricate maneuvering rail alert tragic hospital hamtic retrieval province nearby bus antique kill telephone pabustan wound critical add horn personnel hourslong overnight leader work police tuesday iloilo,-0.9812,0.5548705302096176,12.194947368421053,0.4375,0,2023-12-05

Video from the hospital showed that it was packed with people, including crying children and a young girl who was carried inside and bandaged on the floor.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a correspondent covering international news.

An army reservist who was tasked with identifying those killed by the militants said some of the women were found wearing only bloodied underwear.Such accounts given to The Associated Press, along with first assessments by an Israeli rights group, show that sexual assault was part of an atrocities-filled rampage by Hamas and other Gaza militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages that day.While investigators are still trying to determine the scope of the sexual assaults, Israel’s government is accusing the international community, particularly the United Nations, of ignoring the pain of Israeli victims.“I say to the women’s rights organizations, to the human rights organizations, you’ve heard of the rape of Israeli women, horrible atrocities, sexual mutilation — where the hell are you?” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a news conference Tuesday, switching to English to emphasize the point.U.S. President Joe Biden called the reports of sexual violence “appalling” and urged the world to condemn “horrific accounts of unimaginable cruelty.”Two months after the Hamas attacks on the music festival, farming communities and army posts in southern Israel, police are still struggling to put together the pieces.In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, priority was given to identifying bodies, not to preserving evidence. Police say they’re combing through 60,000 videos seized from the body cameras of Hamas attackers, from social media and from security cameras as well as 1,000 testimonies to bring the perpetrators to justice. It has been difficult finding rape survivors, with many victims killed by their attackers.The group Physicians for Human Rights in Israel, which has a record of advocating for Palestinian civilians in Gaza suffering under Israel's longtime blockade of the territory, published an initial assessment in November.“What we know for sure is that it was more than just one case and it was widespread, in that this happened in more than one location and more than a handful of times,"" Hadas Ziv, policy and ethics director for the organization, said Tuesday. “What we don’t know and what the police are investigating is whether it was ordered to be done and whether it was systematic.”Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.Ron Freger fled the music festival when Hamas attacked and said he heard a woman screaming for help. “I was lying in a pit (and) I heard (a girl) yelling: ‘They’re raping me, they’re raping me!'” he told the AP.Several minutes later, he heard gunshots close by and she fell silent, he said. “The feeling in that moment is one of complete powerlessness. I’m lying in this hole and I have no ability to do anything. I have no weapon, I have nothing, I’m surrounded by other people who are hiding with me and we’re completely powerless,” said the 23-year-old from the northern Israeli town of Netanya.Last month, Israel's police chief presented to the international news media videotaped testimony of a rape witness at the music festival. Her face blurred, she said she watched militants gang-rape a woman as she lay on the ground. The men then stood her up as blood trickled from her back, yanked her hair and sliced her breast, playing with it as they assaulted her. The last man shot her in the head while he was still inside her. The woman in the video described watching the militants as she pretended to be dead.“I couldn’t understand what I saw,” she said.A combat medic told the AP that he came across half a dozen bodies of women and men with possible signs of sexual assault when he reached one of the attacked communities.One girl had been shot in the head and was lying on the floor, her legs open and pants pulled down, with what looked like semen on her lower back, said the medic who spoke on condition of anonymity because his unit was classified. Other bodies had mass bleeding around the groin with limbs at distorted angles, he said.At the Shura military base where victims are being identified, Shari Mendes, a member of the army reserve unit that deals with the identification and religious burial preparation of female soldiers, said some of the women’s bodies came in with little clothing, such as parts of their pajamas. Some only had bloodied underwear.Based on open-source information and interviews, the Physicians for Human Rights in Israel report documents incidents at the music festival, homes around the Gaza Strip and an Israeli military base, all attacked by Hamas.“It is becoming more apparent that the violence perpetrated against women, men and children also included widespread sexual and gender-based crimes,” it says.Before this war, Hamas, an Islamic militant group sworn to Israel's destruction, wasn’t known to use rape as a weapon, said Colin P. Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group, a global intelligence and security consulting firm. Its tactics included suicide bombings and shooting attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians.A country like Israel should have the means to do rigorous testing to confirm if people were sexually assaulted in a more systematic way, said Nidhi Kapur, a specialist on sexual abuse in situations of armed conflict.“Forensic testing should have been a priority to build a full picture of the attack,” said Kapur, who has worked in the region. “In a conflict you first take care of the survivors, you don’t count bodies.”On Tuesday, Netanyahu and members of his war cabinet held a tense and emotional meeting with recently released hostages and family members of hostages still held in Gaza. Some of the recently released hostages shared testimonies of sexual abuse during their time in Gaza, participants said.Separately, a doctor who treated some of the 110 released hostages told the AP that at least 10 men and women among those freed were sexually assaulted or abused, but did not provide further details. He spoke on condition of anonymity to protect the hostages' identities.According to the Israeli military, 138 hostages, including 15 women, are still held by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesman, said the army is “absolutely” concerned about sexual violence against female hostages.On Monday, Israel hosted a special event at the United Nations, where former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and top technology executive Sheryl Sandberg were among those who criticized what they called a global failure to support women who were sexually assaulted and in some cases killed.But some groups say Israel isn't making it easy to investigate.The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said it requested access to Israel and the Palestinian territories to allow it to collect information from the events that took place on Oct. 7 and 8, and since then, but Israel has not responded to its requests, said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Office.Israel says the office has preexisting biases against Israel and it will not cooperate with the body. Israeli officials said they would consider all options for independent international mechanisms to investigate.Rights experts say the United Nations is best placed to conduct a fair, credible and impartial investigation.“These accounts are horrifying and deserve an urgent, thorough, and credible investigation,” said Heather Barr, associate director for the women’s rights division at Human Rights Watch.___",7845,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/widespread-sexual-gender-based-crimes-committed-hamas-attack-105406464,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/389f6f2e-7409-4612-b361-da4c05ab8dec/wirestory_bb06b950bb6794affb8d468cd283bc51_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,apparent aftermath deal account civilian violence town barr preexist anonymity yell mechanism shoot allegation reject horrific body child home found time hillary kapur group physician happen hamas minute nation impartial arm situation firm colin publish security commissioner family switch perpetrator release floor failure islamic particularly global soldier cooperate picture hostage survivor independent lie struggle conduct build bias attacker cabinet heather consult powerlessness angle high spoke news pit appal investigate emotional outdoor music abuse blur destruction country ground perpetrate unit intelligence office longtime report month sworn unimaginable powerless flee pull area ethic bring weapon confirm human easy close associate order blood condemn full immediate northern executive credible seize provide priority gunshot hell military advocate commit medic army mutilation preserve blockade rampage hiding conflict southern tense give classify record identification pajama sandberg deserve shari medium witness base rape complete world location justice participant camera nearby spokesperson bloody nidhi jerusalem scope clarke sheryl hole fair ziv widespread testimony half militant ability ignore director groin make show crime hair forensic criticize completely former share gunman feel urge doctor policy top palestinian dozen expert technology clothing yanked preparation shura suffer case mass attack burial fell community monday described respond sexual farm scream united handful netanyahu shamdasani meeting test rigorous initial bleeding possible absolutely gaza trickle international pain girl find emphasize difficult systematic research document consider determine event told organization specialist state assessment inside benjamin treat region ravina wear video secretary stood slice lay pretend official soufan israel back detail english low silent woman comb special support conference incident victim condition accuse identify sexually bombing shot freger recently territory government information combat suicide investigation include place videotaped interview female hecht open access leg prime count option minister pant richard social religious watch clinton tasked joe concerned biden member protect press surround held present limb part festival mendes paramedic semen understand hadas chief post distort spokesman reservist breast division horrify freed urgent reach kill call horrible atrocity investigator strip head young moment evidence sign request reserve put israeli rap assault heard tactic work play host gillibrand collect police president tuesday kirsten,-0.9971,0.2676864244741873,10.352975206611571,0.4451756819232548,0,2023-12-05
ABC,Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai urges world to confront Taliban's 'gender apartheid' against women,2023-12-05 18:09:00,MOGOMOTSI MAGOME Associated Press and GERALD IMRAY Associated Press,"JOHANNESBURG -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai said Tuesday that the world needs to recognize and confront the “gender apartheid” against women and girls imposed by the Taliban since they seized power in Afghanistan more than two years ago.She urged the international community to take collective and urgent action to end the “dark days” in Afghanistan. Yousafzai was awarded the peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17 for her fight for girls’ education in her home country, Pakistan. She is the youngest Nobel laureate.Two years earlier, she survived an assassination attempt by the Pakistani Taliban — a separate militant group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban — when she was shot in the head on a bus after school.The 26-year-old activist spoke to The Associated Press after delivering the annual Nelson Mandela lecture in Johannesburg on the 10th anniversary of the death of South Africa's anti-apartheid leader and Nobel laureate.Yousafzai is also the youngest person to give the lecture, following in the footsteps of past lecturers, including former President Barack Obama, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres and philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.She dedicated her speech to Afghan women and girls, hoping to re-focus the world’s attention on their oppression amid the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.“It took a bullet to my head for the world to stand with me,"" she said. ""What will it take for the world to stand with girls in Afghanistan?”Since their takeover, the Taliban have banned education for girls beyond the sixth grade and imposed severe restrictions on women, barring them from work and most public spaces and seeking to implement their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia.“Afghanistan has only seen dark days after it fell to the Taliban,” Yousafzai said in the AP interview. “It has been two and half years and most girls have not seen school again.”Yousafzai appealed to the United Nations to “recognize the current state of Afghanistan as a gender apartheid” and cited recent reports of “women being detained, put into prisons and beaten and even put into forced marriages.”“Two and a half years is a very long time,” Yousafzai said and added that it could cost a woman her future.Yousafzai also described as “heartbreaking” Islamabad’s new policy of forceful deportations of Afghans who are in Pakistan illegally, saying that deporting them would put the lives of women and girls who are forced to go back at risk.She also called for an immediate cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war and decried that “so many children's and women’s lives (have been) lost” in besieged Gaza.The war — sparked by the militant Hamas group's unprecedented Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel — has so far killed more than 15,890 people in Gaza, the majority of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.Yousafzai said the world must hold accountable those on both sides who have violated international law and committed war crimes.“We need to make sure that we always are on the side of the innocent people,” she said. “And we are advocating for protecting them and we are advocating for stopping more wars and conflicts.”Yousafzai praised the awarding of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize to Iranian women's rights and pro-democracy activist Narges Mohammadi, who remains imprisoned in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison. Mohammadi's children are due to accept the Nobel medal and diploma on her behalf on Sunday.“When we see more women being appreciated for their tireless efforts to bring justice, to fight against oppression and to fight against gender discrimination, it gives us hope because you realize that you are not alone,"" Yousafzai said.Yousafzai began her fight against the oppression of women and girls by writing and publishing blogs at the age off 11.She had a heartfelt message for young girls today, urging them to find their voice.“Don’t wait for anyone else to speak for you,” she said. “You have the power to stand up for yourself.”___",4113,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/nobel-laureate-malala-yousafzai-urges-world-confront-talibans-105405553,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/e2ba47b6-0dbb-4a01-becf-1597dd28a02c/wirestory_121cfc32090b2f578dac588f61e6e3ff_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,civilian side evin discrimination illegally appeal child violate home effort lose time praise group lecturer laureate nation hamas obama ministry remains afghan award islamic decry forceful amid barack fight accept public action beaten diploma spoke ally cost johannesburg education accord antónio country founder force imprison report microsoft majority nelson separate bring tehran south bill associate today innocent blog immediate apartheid seize pakistani advocate lecture commit person takeover past stop appreciate restriction narges give recognize medal heartfelt follow health implement world afghanistan justice day grade nobel heartbreaking attempt philanthropist half militant leader make former urge policy accountable wait law tireless ban combatant assassination long due begin stand attack yousafzai differentiate hop fell community described iranian united mohammadi dedicate prison gaza current international space girl find notorious year state hope deportation age taliban detain write severe israel back gender hold woman annual unprecedented africa recent dark shot seek life territory mandela behalf include attention interview impose anniversary death deliver pakistan malala collective realize islamabad prize confront protect peace press guterres survive message bar power footstep activist publishing sixth spark urgent bus deport earlier kill besiege call head young oppression school interpretation put add bullet speak work speech strict president tuesday,-0.9031,0.6564551422319472,10.596,0.3825903774587985,0,2023-12-05
Politico,Fighting intensifies in Gaza’s south,2023-12-05 17:41:00,not specified,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israel said Tuesday that its troops had entered Gaza’s second-largest city as intensified bombardment sent streams of ambulances and cars racing to hospitals with wounded and dead Palestinians, including children, in a bloody new phase of the war.The military said its forces were “in the heart” of Khan Younis, which has emerged as the first target in the expanded ground offensive into southern Gaza that Israel says aims to destroy Hamas. Military officials said they were engaged in the “most intense day” of battles since the ground offensive began more than five weeks ago, with heavy firefights also taking place in northern Gaza.The assault into the south threatens to fuel a new wave of displaced Palestinians and a worsening of Gaza’s humanitarian catastrophe. The U.N. said 1.87 million people — more than 80 percent of Gaza’s population — have been driven from their homes and that fighting is now preventing distribution of food, water and medicine outside a tiny sliver of southern Gaza. New military evacuation orders are squeezing people into ever-smaller areas of the south.Bombardment has grown fiercer across the territory, including areas where Palestinians are told to seek safety. In the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, just north of Khan Younis, a strike Tuesday destroyed a house where dozens of displaced people were sheltering. At least 34 people were killed, including at least six children, according to an Associated Press reporter at the hospital who counted the bodies.Footage from the scene showed women screaming from an upper floor of a house shattered to a concrete shell. In the wreckage below, men pulled the limp body of a child from under a slab next to a burning car. At the nearby hospital, medics tried to resuscitate a young boy and girl, bloodied and unmoving on a stretcher.Israel’s assault in retaliation for Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack has killed more than 15,890 people in Gaza — 70 percent of them women and children — with more than 42,000 wounded, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. It says hundreds have been killed or wounded since a weeklong cease-fire ended Friday, and many still are trapped under rubble.Israel says it must remove Hamas from power to prevent a repeat of the attack that ignited the war, when Hamas and other militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took captive some 240 men, women and children.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday the military would have to retain open-ended security control over the Gaza Strip long after the war ends. His comments suggested a renewed direct Israeli occupation of Gaza, something the United States says it opposes.Netanyahu said only the Israeli military can ensure Gaza remains demilitarized. “No international force can be responsible for this,” he said at a news conference. “I’m not ready to close my eyes and accept any other arrangement.”Under U.S. pressure to prevent further mass casualties, Israel says it is being more precise as it widens its offensive and is taking extra steps to urge civilians to evacuate out of its path. Weeks of bombardment and a ground offensive obliterated much of northern Gaza.The military accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields when the militants operate in dense residential areas. But Israel has not provided accounting for targeting in individual strikes, some of which have leveled entire city blocks and complexes of dozens of multi-story apartment towers.Military Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi acknowledged that Israeli forces use heavy force against civilian structures, saying militants keep weapons in houses and buildings so fighters in civilian clothes can use them to fire on troops.“Striking them requires significant use of fire, both to target the enemy but also to, of course, protect our forces,” he said. “Therefore the forces operate powerfully.”Halevi said his forces had begun the “third phase of the ground operations,” moving against Hamas in the south after seizing much of the north. Israel has not given specific details on troop movements.Residents said troops advanced to Bani Suheila, on Khan Younis’ eastern edge. Israeli forces also appear to be moving to partially cut across the strip between Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. Satellite photos from Sunday showed around 150 Israeli tanks, armored personnel carriers and other vehicles on the main road between the two cities.The past days brought some of the heaviest bombardment of the entire war, the U.N.’s humanitarian affairs office OCHA said.Witnesses said a strike Tuesday hit a school in Khan Younis where hundreds of displaced people were sheltering. Casualties overwhelmed the nearby Nasser Hospital, where wounded men and children were lain on a bloody floor amid a tangle of IV tubes. In the morgue, a woman draped herself over the stretcher where her dead husband and child lay among at least nine bodies.“What’s happening here is unimaginable,” said Hamza al-Bursh, who lives near the school. “They strike indiscriminately.”In northern Gaza, the military said its troops were battling Hamas militants in the Jabaliya refugee camp and the district of Shujaiya, capturing Hamas positions and destroying rocket launchers and underground infrastructure.The battles in the north signaled the tough resistance from Hamas since Israeli forces moved in on Oct. 27. The military says 86 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza offensive and that thousands of Hamas fighters have been killed, though it has not produced evidence.Even after weeks of bombardment, Hamas’ top leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar — whose location is unknown — was able to conduct complex cease-fire negotiations and orchestrate the release of more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners last week. Palestinian militants have also kept up their rocket fire into Israel.After the full-scale evacuation of northern Gaza ordered by Israel early in the war, most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million is squeezed into the 90 square miles of central and southern Gaza.Since moving into the south, the Israeli military has ordered people out of nearly two dozen neighborhoods in and around Khan Younis. That further reduced the area where civilians can seek refuge by more than a quarter. It was not clear how many people followed the evacuation call.“Nowhere is safe in Gaza, and there is nowhere left to go,” Lynn Hastings, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said Monday. “The conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist. If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold.”For the past two days, aid distribution — mainly just supplies of flour and water — has been possible only in the city of Rafah, at the far south by the border, the U.N. said. Locations deeper inside Gaza, including Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and northern Gaza, could not be reached because of fighting.Dr. Nasser Bolbol, head of neonatal intensive care at the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Younis, said acute hunger was spreading, with some deaths of children from dehydration and undernourishment, after nearly two months with only limited aid entering the territory, under an Israeli seal.“Gaza is entirely covered in death and darkness,” he said.Family members of hostages still held in Gaza held tense talks with Netanyahu and the war cabinet Tuesday. Observers present said more than 100 people attended the nearly three-hour meeting. Some relatives shouted at cabinet members, perceiving they did not have any immediate plans to rescue some 138 hostages still captive. Nearly half the room left in disappointment before the meeting ended.During the gathering, five hostages released during the truce shared harrowing details of their experience. One spoke of Hamas fighters “touching” female hostages, and another said militants shaved off a male hostage’s body hair to humiliate him, according to a group representing the hostages’ families. Others said they were deprived of water.The Associated Press has not been able to verify reports that female and male hostages experienced sexual abuse in Gaza.“It was not a relaxed discussion,” said Noam Peri, whose 80-year-old father is still hostage. “After 60 days, people are tired and worried.”",8384,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/israel-hamas-fighting-gaza-south-00130250,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/b2ebab7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7732x5155+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F16%2Ff6%2F1feada49402d80631bb6bd75f669%2Fisrael-palestinians-62544.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dead phase limp civilian town draped sinwar staff undernourishment specific orchestrate central relative clothes father child home obliterate body percent shelter distribution weeklong intensified group vehicle troop discussion happen hamas morgue unknown tough partially hastings refuge flour ministry security remains apartment family coordinator husband rescue release floor soldier darkness hostage accept amid fight remove evacuate north ago conduct shell dense cabinet ready observer spoke capture news exist tangle enemy battling abuse water accord individual bolbol verify force ground office month report truce unimaginable deir pull area weapon human south firefights close armored order associate comment tire immediate northern bombardment seize provide neonatal emerge aid grown ocha military mile medic target iv carrier negotiation khan past wreckage accuses experience suheila southern tense give affair control disappointment plan require advanced camp talk precise exchange entire health follow hospital squeeze neighborhood evacuation location responsible day limited scenario expand nearby renew herzi hit bloody quarter younis tiny personnel safe half male militant leader rafah satellite jabaliya show entirely hair heaviest enter share clear intense urge spread resuscitate top strike palestinian dozen occupation touch ban peri combatant refugee long residential represent structure shujaiya suggest begin path safety mass attack threatens differentiate produce repeat monday worried shatter sexual shave scream united course netanyahu underground meeting relaxed casualty photo fiercer eastern million possible tube border gaza international scene girl thousand trap ignite lynn aim operation unmoving room fighter nasser battle humanitarian deprive told state experienced engage cover inside benjamin population friday perceive step move prisoner city race offensive lay boy building official house widens israel detail heart eye heavy hamza slab tank woman road reduce position signal deeper intensive overwhelmed acute fuel conference condition direct seek life territory accounting stretcher cut dehydration prevent early ensure significant block yehya include place complex hellish stream wave captive female reporter humiliate fire death catastrophe square acknowledge deliver sliver food brought count minister concrete noam car european burning supply hunger gathering left worsen member protect displace press medicine held present destroy retaliation driven power destroyed level chief launcher ambulance demilitarize hundred sunday edge reach kill upper strip head wound young shout shield school retain israeli extra rocket assault resistance operate foreign pressure harrow attend week tuesday district halevi,-0.9983,0.3220419847328243,11.064031936127735,0.3882668763528138,0,2023-12-05
ABC,"Hospitals in southern Gaza are at 'breaking point,' international organizations say",2023-12-05 17:33:00,Mary Kekatos,"Hospitals in central and southern Gaza are at a ""breaking point"" and struggling to care for the influx of patients amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization say.Two hospitals -- Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza and Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza -- are overwhelmed and are being forced to prioritize those with life-threatening conditions, according to Doctors Without Borders, or Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which has staff working at both medical centers.""We hear bombing around us, day and night,"" Katrien Claeys, an MSF team leader in Gaza, said in a press release Monday. ""In the last 48 hours, over 100 dead and over 400 injured people arrived at the emergency room of Al-Aqsa Hospital. Some patients were taken for surgery right away.""""We see patients with signs of infection and necrotic tissue, as they have not received a change of wound dressing in days and sometimes weeks,"" she said.MSF said Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where many patients with trauma and burn injuries go, is facing a never-ending flow of patients and is ""now at breaking point.""""The hospital has been receiving multiple severely injured patients nearly every hour,"" Chris Hook, MSF medical coordinator in Khan Younis, said in the press release. ""There is no available space anymore -- it really is a terrible situation. Everyone is genuinely worried about what will come next.""The WHO said medical staff are caring for two to three times as many patients as the hospitals are designed to hold. The agency described a ""catastrophic situation"" at the Nasser Hospital with an overflowing emergency department, patients being treated on the floor and a shortage of health workers.A temporary cease-fire between the Hamas terrorist organization and Israel ended early Friday, and Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza. The end of the cease-fire came after Hamas freed over 100 of the more than 200 people its militants took hostage during the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel. In exchange, Israel released more than 200 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.Since Friday, Israeli forces have closed in around Khan Younis, and ground forces are now operating ""in and around"" the key southern Gaza city, an Israeli military official confirmed to ABC News.Meanwhile, at least 16,248 people have been killed -- including 1,240 since the temporary cease-fire ended Friday -- and 42,000 have been injured since Oct. 7, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health and the Hamas government media office. In Israel, at least 1,200 people have been killed and 6,900 others have been injured, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, wrote Tuesday on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the agency moved medical supplies to a warehouse in Rafah, which is located at the Egypt border crossing.Tedros said this delayed the delivery of medication and other supplies to MSF and United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) facilities, where they are caring for patients.""The movement has already been delayed and will continue to challenge our deliveries to hospitals in Gaza, amid widespread armed conflict and limited staff on the ground,"" he wrote. ""We need a sustained and safe flow of medical aid to provide care to people in Gaza.""This comes just one day after the WHO released a statement calling for the protection of health systems in Gaza, recalling what the WHO called a ""dire and perilous"" situation when the Al-Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals in the north were both forced to stop operations last month amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.""We have seen what happened in northern Gaza.

ABC,"El Salvador is seeing worst rights abuses since 1980-1992 civil war, Amnesty reports",2023-12-05 17:12:00,The Associated Press,"SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- El Salvador is experiencing one of the worst human rights crises since the country’s 1980-1992 civil war, because of President Nayib Bukele ’s harsh anti-gang crackdown, Amnesty International said in a report released Tuesday.The rights group claimed that the almost 74,000 people jailed in the crackdown were subjected to “systematic use of torture and other mistreatment.”“The deterioration in human rights that we have documented in recent years is extremely worrisome,” said Ana Piquer, the Americas director for Amnesty International.“The adoption of a highly repressive security policy and the weakening of the rule of law has led the country to one of its worst crises since the civil war,” Piquer said, referring to the 1980s conflict between leftist guerrillas and government forces that left 75,000 dead.The group based its report on 83 interviews in El Salvador, including victims of abuses.The Associated Press interviewed two former inmates who were on provisional release from prison, who said they had suffered and witnessed severe beatings by guards inside prison.Rights groups say that Bukele’s mass round-up of suspected gang members has included some young men arrested and jailed simply on the basis of their low-wage jobs, lower education levels or place of residence.Local rights groups also say the crackdown has left 327 people missing and at least 190 dead.The policy has lowered El Salvador’s homicide rate and given a popularity boost to Bukele, who plans to run for re-election despite a constitutional ban on running again.____",1585,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/el-salvador-worst-rights-abuses-1980-1992-civil-105404186,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b9f80853-a633-45eb-980c-c58758551ca8/wirestory_9e6df04aed5b8a21b02e8614b345105a_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,extremely policy job law arrest ban lower bukele nayib suffer interviewed deterioration mass rate popularity group subject boost basis security release crackdown prison harsh international highly salvador refer systematic document amnesty year gang inside homicide run america inmate severe education low despite country force constitutional report miss crisis recent repressive victim provisional government human associate include guard place interview claimed worrisome leftist jail beating adoption experience lead conflict left torture give member press plan witness level base piquer rule young suspect ana civil simply guerrilla director weaken president san former,-0.99,0.0,13.058823529411764,0.3616917293233082,0,2023-12-05
ABC,Residents in northern Mexico protest over delays in cleaning up a mine spill,2023-12-05 17:03:00,The Associated Press,"MEXICO CITY -- Residents in Mexico’s northern state of Sonora on Tuesday protested against what they said is the government’s continued failure to clean up an almost decade-old mine spill.At a news conference held outside government offices in Hermosillo, the state capital, members of the local advocacy group the Sonora River Basin Committee described the situation as a health crisis that authorities continue to ignore.“You have asked us for patience and our patience has lasted almost two years,"" Martha Patricia Velarde said. ""Today we tell you again: Bureaucracy should never be above the health and life of the people.”Nine years ago, millions of gallons of toxic waste flooded from Grupo México’s Buenavista mine into the Sonora and Bacanuchi rivers, just under 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the border city of Nogales, Sonora.Mexico’s environmental secretary María Luisa Albores González has described the spill as “the most serious environmental disaster in the history of metal mining in Mexico.""In a 2022 study, the state health department found 10% of residents in the polluted area — almost 100 square miles (250 square kilometers) around the spill — were at high or very high risk of developing arsenic poisoning.After years of waiting, recent months have seen a flurry of encouraging rhetoric, but little apparent progress.In September, Mexico’s environment department released a report describing “alarming” levels of pollution around the spill. Then the following month Albores announced the department had filed a legal complaint against Grupo México for failing to pay for the damage.Since then what was the only remaining water treatment plant in operation closed at the end of November. Under an initial settlement, Grupo México agreed to open 36 treatment plants, but only began construction on 10.The environmental department and a spokesperson for Grupo México declined to comment on Tuesday's protest or give any updates on the government's legal complaint.The mining company's spokesperson referred to an October news release in which the company declined responsibility for pollution in the region.“The environmental conditions and integrity of the Sonora and Bacanuchi river ecosystems are the same as they were before the 2014 accident,” read the statement. “The Sonora river region has suffered the effects of continuous disinformation campaigns ... causing fear and unfounded distrust.”",2420,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/residents-northern-mexico-protest-delays-cleaning-mine-spill-105403871,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/de1870fc-ab9c-4fa8-86da-f8ca85ebc015/wirestory_e9535cfcb85ab524d04a55483a3f192e_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,wait apparent kilometer martha update environment flurry begin authority suffer buenavista found river pollution group described fail mining sonora decline ecosystem situation patricia maría plant initial million fear failure border release treatment resident refer operation disinformation pay describe year state ago méxico advocacy effect region mexico committee accident develop secretary high city news spill basin construction complaint clean water local grupo flood office month report hermosillo rhetoric conference october luisa crisis recent condition announce statement pollute patience legal area life government gonzález close waste continue file today risk alarm comment encourage northern open history square remain metal mile settlement agree integrity continuous campaign gallon responsibility protest bacanuchi give member bureaucracy held september company read level unfounded follow health arsenic environmental continued capital spokesperson study november toxic nogales department disaster albores velarde distrust tuesday,-0.9732,0.6198347107438017,12.426729857819904,0.3618194444444444,0,2023-12-05

He had been accused of being the mastermind behind the slayings of 25 Peruvians by a military death squad during his administration from 1990 to 2000, while the government fought the Shining Path communist rebels.Fujimori's 2017 pardon granted by then-President Pablo Kuczynski was annulled under pressure from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and its status was the subject of legal wrangling since then.The constitutional court previously had ordered a lower court in the southern city of Ica to release Fujimori, but that court declined to do so, arguing in ruling last Friday that it lacked the authority.

Washington Post,"Israel pushes into south Gaza. A school is bombed, a hospital, overwhelmed.",2023-12-05 12:48:00,"Loveday Morris, Ruby Mellen","KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — They were brought to the doors of southern Gaza’s al-Nasser Hospital in private cars, in trucks and on carts.The injured and the dead had imagined that sheltering in a school would provide some safety. But as has happened so often in Gaza during this war, it did not.The bodies of around 20 people killed in a strike, wrapped in white sheets, lay in the yard outside the hospital morgue Tuesday morning. Relatives shouted and wept.The Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday pushed into Khan Younis, expanding their war against Hamas on a new front and bringing fresh terror to Palestinians who say they now have nowhere to run. Until now, southern Gaza’s largest city had been a haven for civilians fleeing Gaza City and the north.More than 80 percent of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million has been displaced, according to the United Nations. Many have gathered in schools and hospitals in the south in the expectation that they would be spared. The school in the Maan neighborhood of Khan Younis was bombed early Tuesday.Hamad Abu Sarhan, 51, and his family had sought shelter there after Israeli forces ordered civilians to evacuate other areas in the south. They had been there for two days when it was attacked. Abu Sarhan’s 28-year-old nephew was killed.“The situation is truly catastrophic,” Abu Sarhan said.Hostages freed by Hamas and angry relatives of those still held in Gaza told Israel’s security cabinet Tuesday that they feared the fighting would endanger those who remain in Gaza.“What I see on TV scares me a lot,” one former hostage said, according to Haaretz. “I see [Israeli] bombings there, and you have no idea where the captives are. … I was in a house surrounded by explosions. We slept in tunnels, and we feared not Hamas, but Israel might kill us, and then it would have been said, ‘Hamas killed you.’”Khan Younis is home to Yehiya Sinwar, the Hamas military chief in Gaza and the top target on Israel’s list. It had a population of around 400,000 before the war, but the count ballooned as Israel focused on the fighting in the north.Fighting continues to rage in the north. As more people are displaced, the United Nations says it is running out of tents to give to the displaced.The current hostilities began Oct. 7, when Hamas and allied fighters overran communities in southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages. Israel’s goal now is to destroy Hamas as a military and political force.Israel said Tuesday it was intensifying its efforts. In addition to moving into Khan Younis, Israeli forces entered the dense Gaza City neighborhoods of Jabalya and Shejaiya, where Hamas is thought to be deeply dug in.Israel has said repeatedly that it is abiding by international law and seeking to minimize civilian casualties, but aid agencies say conditions for civilians are dire.“The situation is getting worse by the hour,” Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s representative in Gaza, told reporters Tuesday. “There’s intensified bombing going on all around, including here in the southern areas, Khan Younis and even in Rafah” on the enclave’s border with Egypt.Abu Sarhan said the bombing overnight was intense. “It was the hardest night of my life,” he said. “We were surrounded by belts of fire from everywhere. The attacks by planes and tanks did not stop throughout the hours of the night.”Injured in the attack were Abu Sarhan’s brother, his 15-year-old niece and his 7-year-old-nephew. Ambulances could not reach the area, he said; the injured were taken out in private vehicles. Buses came later to transport survivors.“When we left the place, there were corpses everywhere and in the streets,” he said. “There were screams from people trapped in their homes.”Ibrahim Abu Awwad was injured in the strikes. “People were sprawled on the ground, some with severed limbs,” he said.Israel has said it is has started a new phase in its campaign: urban fighting. “We’re moving ahead with the second stage now,” government spokesman Eylon Levy said, “a second stage that is going to be difficult militarily.”“We are talking about close-quarter fighting that engages terrorists emerging from tunnels and buildings,” Levy said.Fighting in Gaza resumed Friday after a seven-day break to allow the exchange of hostages and the entry of more humanitarian aid. Each side accused the other of breaching the truce.“Those who thought that the IDF would not know how to renew the fighting after the pause were mistaken,” Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi said. “Hamas is already feeling this.”Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar, called on the U.N. Security Council to force Israel to return to negotiations to end the war. He called it “shameful” that the international community was not doing more to stop the bloodletting.Gaza’s health-care system continues to collapse. Palestinians sheltering at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia on the northern edge of Gaza said they were surrounded by Israeli tanks and unable to leave. “Anyone who tries to go out gets shot,” Anas Sharief, a journalist with Al Jazeera, said in a video message. “We ask God for safety.” Kamal Adwan, northern Gaza’s only remaining government hospital, was out of service Tuesday, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.More than 400,000 people in northern Gaza are completely without medical services, the ministry said.With much of the staff of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis unable to reach the facility, emergency department head Mohamed Qandeel said that he and three other doctors had treated 80 severely injured patients. Twenty of the injured needed surgery, and 10 needed intensive care, he said. “These days we cannot forget,” he said. “They are catastrophic days.”",5756,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/05/israel-hamas-gaza-khan-younis/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3BUIEKAJQXGXNARV47W2PFVOWI_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3BUIEKAJQXGXNARV47W2PFVOWI_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3BUIEKAJQXGXNARV47W2PFVOWI_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3BUIEKAJQXGXNARV47W2PFVOWI_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3BUIEKAJQXGXNARV47W2PFVOWI_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3BUIEKAJQXGXNARV47W2PFVOWI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dead phase civilian side mistaken emir sinwar staff medical thani hour relative body home effort stage levy percent unable shelter peeperkorn intensified vehicle happen hamas morgue nation situation allied lahia jabalya ministry breaching sharief security family fear representative balloon truck hostage tent fight evacuate overran north run system cabinet dense minimize yehiya lot dug white yard deeply accord enclave force ground hostility front flee area bring god political south intensify street abu order northern spar provide emerge endanger aid military target campaign return negotiation khan stop agency engages jazeera beit southern give explosion push talk tv exchange health hospital neighborhood general world day expand renew herzi expectation younis department large idf urban bombed rafah sever enter intense former completely imagine feel emergency doctor top law kamal strike palestinian ibrahim abide tamim transport hardest sprawl begin leave safety attack entry hamad night goal journalist community shejaiya scream severely united twenty start slept casualty service million collapse border gaza wrap plane current international resume trap council difficult private break fighter nasser humanitarian brother told organization awwad qandeel treat population tunnel friday nephew move video focus facility city patient lay corps building house israel mohamed tank eylon intensive condition accuse bombing catastrophic seek life adwan shot government early continue include place captive idea gather reporter terrorist fire fresh remain terror brought count sheet richard scare car haaretz morning angry repeatedly left list injured displace surround held message sarhan destroy limb rage forget chief sought spokesman defense belt ambulance ahead freed bus shameful niece reach edge kill call strip head shout surgery qatar school ana israeli addition pause overnight tuesday halevi,-0.9975,0.5733148019457956,8.607399463806967,0.2969834710743802,0,2023-12-05
Politico,Ukrainian leaders head to the US as Kyiv prepares for winter fighting,2023-12-05 12:16:00,Paul McLeary,"Ukraine’s top national security leaders are in Washington this week for a series of critical meetings with their U.S. and NATO counterparts as Kyiv seeks to become a weapons-building powerhouse once again.The meetings, which begin Wednesday, have major implications for not only the war, but also for Ukraine’s ability to manufacture arms in the coming years. With the war at a standstill and concern building over long-term Western support for Kyiv, the gathering is likely a barometer for what that support will look like in the months and years ahead.The Ukrainian delegation is being led by presidential adviser Andriy Yermak, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Alexander Kamyshin, minister of strategic industries. After meeting with lawmakers on Tuesday, they’ll spend Wednesday and Thursday huddling with their counterparts from the White House, Pentagon, Commerce and State departments as well as key NATO members and executives from the largest defense firms.Initially envisioned as a way for the Ukrainians to forge new contacts and commitments with the U.S. defense industry to bolster Kyiv’s ability to build its own weapons, the meetings have taken on a deeper importance as the Biden administration pressures Congress to pass a $60 billion aid package, and as questions swirl over next steps in the war.The big names running the meetings reflect its ambitions, with around 350 U.S., Ukrainian and European industry and government representatives slated to attend the closed-door sessions that will feature the national armaments directors from across the 50 nations that have banded together to supply Ukraine. They’ll be meeting with the Pentagon’s acquisition chief, William LaPlante.The first day of what’s been dubbed the U.S.-Ukraine Defense Industrial Base Conference will be led by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and senior Ukrainian officials. The second day “will focus on business-to-business networking and cooperation,” according to a National Security Council spokesperson.Speaking in Kyiv last month, Yermak called the Washington trip “extremely important for our defense industry. The event will be attended by representatives of several dozen domestic enterprises, both [Ukrainian] state-owned and private. Even more companies are from the United States.”The goal for the government in Kyiv is to move away from relying on the largesse of partners abroad to rebuilding its own defense industry and eventually becoming an exporter of drones and other equipment that Ukrainian engineers have focused on since the Russian invasion.The visit comes as Ukrainian forces are grinding through the second bloody winter of battling entrenched Russian troops.Yet the mood is different this year. Last winter, confidence was high over the anticipated springtime offensives, and the supposed ragged state of Russian morale was thought to presage a more successful counterpunch than Ukraine managed to achieve. This December the outlook is more muted, given months of static frontline fighting across hundreds of miles of farmland that has turned the war into an artillery slugfest over yards of muddy earth.In order to break the stalemate while protecting Ukrainian critical infrastructure from Russian ballistic missile and drone attacks, air defenses are at the top of Ukraine’s list of equipment it needs from allies for the winter months, led by short-range radars.Specifically, Kyiv is looking for Sentinel short-range radars that are designed to track ballistic missiles, slower-moving drones and fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft — and a lot in between, according to a person familiar with the U.S.-Ukraine discussions, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Kyiv is also seeking 155mm and 152mm ammunition and 120mm Grad air defense rockets. Plus, it wants smaller counterbattery radars that frontline units can use to locate the source of Russian mortar and short-range missile fire.“We understand Russia will use missiles against us this winter but they are just waiting for the cold weather to target our gas and electric sites,” said Ukrainian parliamentarian Yehor Cherniev, deputy chair of the Committee on National Security, Defence and Intelligence, on the sidelines of the Halifax International Security Forum last month.“One of our key points when we were in Washington for meetings was that we don’t want to have fish, but have the tools to catch the fish,” Cherniev said. Two European defense contractors have already pledged their commitment to begin work in Ukraine, though no U.S. manufacturers have followed suit. Rheinmetall, the German arms giant, has said it would work with Ukraine’s state arms company, Ukroboronprom, to build tanks and armored vehicles, and British-based BAE has also announced it is opening an office in Kyiv and could begin making 105mm guns in Ukraine.It’s a different approach from last December, when Abrams tanks, F-16 fighter jets and long-range U.S. and U.K. missiles were at the top of Kyiv’s list of requests. At that point in the war, Ukrainian leaders were fresh from their shockingly successful fall counteroffensive that swept Russian troops from hundreds of square miles of ground throughout the east and south, and they promised with refitting and restocking over the winter, they would repeat their success in the spring.That didn’t happen despite a summer of brutal combat against entrenched Russian forces, with columns of new Western armor and longer-rage missiles proving effective — but not effective enough — against a fortified and dug-in enemy.With the fate of $60 billion in weapons and other aid still stalled in Congress, and less than $5 billion left in authority for President Joe Biden to transfer more weapons and equipment from U.S. shelves, Kyiv is eager to get that package passed before messy American presidential election politics intervene to slow things down, or potentially cut off aid.In a change from previous meetings, Ukrainian leaders have shifted from publicly demanding the donation of major weapons systems. Instead, they are using their energy to assure Western allies they’re ready for a long fight that they hope will be insulated from Western politics and tied more closely with the global defense industry.One recent assault illustrated the shift. An attack by multiple Ukrainian-made drones targeted power generation sites in the Russian-occupied east, a tactic learned from the Russians who have been trying to turn out the lights in Kyiv since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The Ukrainian assault was a modest success, managing to shut off the power in several occupied towns. But the message it sent was more lasting: Kyiv would continue to push through the winter to exert new pressures on the Russian forces occupying its territory, and it now had the means to do so.Ukraine has poured millions of dollars into its short- and medium-range drone programs in recent months, identifying it as a place where investments could pay off quickly. In the process they have bought up commercial drones from across the globe to use on one-way missions and to drop small ordnance on Russian troops, an effort recently matched by Russia, creating a deadly new drone war across hundreds of miles of entrenched front lines.The war over the electric grid is likely only getting started, however, as Ukrainian officials have noted for weeks that Russian missile strikes on the capital have become suspiciously less frequent, sparking concerns that Moscow is hoarding its missiles and Iranian drones for bigger, harder-to-defend attacks this winter aimed at freezing out civilians in Kyiv and other major cities.“Russia will most probably continue to attack the energy infrastructure” throughout the winter, said Pavel Verkhniatskyi, managing partner at COSA Intelligence Solutions in Kyiv. “On the one hand, they gathered quite a number of missiles and drones and adapted their tactics, but on the other, we have more air defense this time and we have also learned a lot throughout the war.”Those lessons have come at a heavy cost. Holding out for so long while unable to strike a decisive blow against occupying Russian forces has made the endgame for the war less clear, which has led to some nervousness in Europe and Washington over how long their military support can continue as defense industries struggle to increase production.“We already feel the lack of these resources,” said Cherniev, the Ukrainian lawmaker, “because the packages [from the U.S.] now become less and less, smaller and smaller. But the intensity of this war is not, will not become any less.”",8695,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/ukraine-officials-visit-washington-weapons-00130093,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/428fae5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ff4%2F21%2F1fc98c3140ae8f1db745469a27d7%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1681327612,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,ukraine implication civilian town blow change donation national farmland effort band winter time unable troop discussion quickly verkhniatskyi happen yehor arm successful brutal effective intervene forum representative sentinel abrams big pay fight shelf manufacturer intensity struggle lloyd artillery armor lot high ally yard battling commercial note cold mood despite rebuild unit office month cosa february announce column front suppose south delegation order approach potentially standstill ammunition swept counterpunch probably thursday target chair gun demand give presidential contractor exert instead push raimondo shift away small suspiciously base day missile capital enterprise pledge jake static point industrial austin counterpart department abroad director make energy clear feel extremely wait fish grind radar stalemate authority lawmaker commitment repeat light goal session pavel iranian process meeting administration grant yermak million hoard nervousness pass success rag key council william ambition largesse break investment networking fighter bought locate year hope hand publicly infrastructure december program focus offensive ordnance rustem heavy frontline tank east deeper conference seek bolster recently generation cut sideline german presage continue ukroboronprom place closely solution dubbed manage square fate wednesday prove cooperation mute european lead package supply gathering joe eventually create member domestic learn importance western huddle refit shut aircraft mission halifax mortar kyiv muddy commerce call globe catch rocket critical assault modest match visit work tactic feature tuesday president week stall barometer anonymity giant increase swirl forge europe eager alexander rheinmetall strategic vehicle shockingly nation tool security bae ukrainian adviser global question engineer parliamentarian build run drone system committee ready jet white cost lack umerov design accord force ground intelligence confidence trip electric opening major concern slow weapon weather source fortify armored lesson executive aid endgame military mile person envision armament insulate turn tie ballistic exporter number deputy company follow pentagon bloody previous spend track gina senior large rely billion ability occupy leader slat adapt top strike dozen equipment russian long begin springtime grad attack industry gas decisive invasion dollar united contact start slugfest politics discus sullivan andriy assure grid international aim important private event series state step move secretary russia reflect building official house transfer hold counteroffensive fall support recent acquisition kamyshin identify resource election cherniev territory air government promise moscow combat entrench different multiple deadly gather congress familiar defence fresh american minister freeze site manufacture outlook internal left list biden suit protect drop message frequent summer illustrate power understand chief anticipate defense counterbattery spark hundred achieve request washington partner powerhouse pressure nato attend restock messy,0.98205,0.1725129384703852,12.51438829787234,0.3695963572735226,0,2023-12-05
NPR,Nigerian president calls for investigation after army drone strike accident kills 85,2023-12-05 10:48:00,Emmanuel Akinwotu,"Villagers in Nigeria's northern Kaduna state had gathered for the Muslim celebration of the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, when they were hit by the airstrike operated from an armed drone at around 9 p.m. Sunday. Those killed included children and elderly, according to emergency services, as a search for more bodies continues. Community leaders told local media the death toll was over 90 people, and eyewitnesses in the rural town of Tudun Biri described horrific scenes of several mutilated bodies. In a statement through Tuesday, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu said the attack was ""disturbing and painful"" and pledged a ""thorough and full-fledged investigation into the incident,"" which he described as a ""bombing mishap."" A spokesman for the army, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said its forces had located a group of people and determined they were militants, who officials often refer to as ""bandits,"" at large in north and central Nigeria. Officers ""misinterpreted their pattern of activities to be similar to that of the bandits,"" he said. Criminal groups of thousands of militants have become the primary security threat in much of northern and central Nigeria, effectively occupying rural villages, launching attacks and mass kidnappings. On Tuesday, the head of the Nigerian army, Lt. Gen. Taoreed Lagbaja, visited the scene and the local hospital where victims were taken to be treated. ""It is grave, regrettable,"" Lagbaja said. ""We will do everything possible to prevent such an occurrence from happening again in the conduct of our operations going forward."" Yet calls for accountability are building, following one of the worst apparently accidental attacks against civilians among a pattern of similar incidents. In January, 39 people were killed by an army airstrike in the central state of Nasarawa. In June, the Nigerian air force admitted responsibility, and has since provided no further details on whether any officers were held accountable. In 2017, the air force bombed a refugee camp in the northeastern town of Rann in Borno state, the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency. More than 100 people were killed, including aid workers. The air force said the airstrike was launched using the wrong coordinates, and it did not reveal whether any officers were held accountable. The U.S. government has provided Nigeria's armed forces with support and weapons in its fight against insurgent groups, despite a long record of human rights violations in the West African nation and ""accidental"" attacks against civilians without prosecution. In April last year, the State Department approved an almost $1 billion weapons sale to Nigeria.",2658,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1217317616/nigerian-president-calls-for-investigation-after-army-drone-strike-accident-kill,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,airstrike emergency forward accountable reveal prophet civilian town apparently refugee long accountability painful effectively disturb central similar mass child body horrific attack worker community group described nwachukwu happen nation arm muhammad mutilate security service january wrong possible kidnapping criminal scene activity occurrence coordinate thousand refer operation fight nigerian determine locate nasarawa told year state north insurgent birthday conduct pattern drone treat accidental tinubu brig prosecution epicenter building official detail villager accord primary rann despite local celebration force insurgency village support regrettable bandit april incident rural victim lagbaja approve statement bombing onyema weapon air government west human prevent african continue investigation include northern taoreed gather provide aid death boko army search responsibility grave toll elderly record admit held medium eyewitness camp misinterpret launch follow spokesman hospital kaduna threat sunday muslim nigeria kill pledge hit haram call june head department violation large officer northeastern billion militant occupy visit operate leader bombed borno tudun president tuesday mishap,-0.99365,0.4514672686230248,10.391505154639177,0.3870068027210884,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Yet the group remains largely intact.,2023-12-05 10:39:00,Loveday Morris,"TEL AVIV — As Israel opens a new southern front in its war in Gaza, it is still far from achieving its stated military objective: the total destruction of the Hamas militant group that rules the enclave and spearheaded the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel.At least 5,000 Hamas militants have been killed, according to three Israeli security officials, leaving the majority of the group’s estimated 30,000-strong military wing intact.The Israeli officials spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing military operations and details that have not been made public.Operations in the north are far from complete. Though much of Gaza City has been leveled by airstrikes, ground forces have yet to enter some of Hamas’s key strongholds there.“This is going to be a long haul,” said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a spokesman for the Israeli military. “We need the time,” he added, acknowledging the diplomatic clock was ticking.International pressure to minimize civilians deaths is likely to influence the pace of operations in the south, as Israel tries to maintain the support of the United States, its key backer.The cost has already been devastating, with nearly 16,000 Palestinians killed, including more than 5,000 children, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.“I think we have reached a moment when the Israeli authorities will have to define more clearly what their final objective is,” French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday. “The total destruction of Hamas? Does anybody think that’s possible? If it’s that, the war will last 10 years.”About a third of Gaza City is still out of the control of Israeli forces, including some areas that are expected to be heavily fortified, said Michael Milshtein, former head of the Palestinian department in Israel’s military intelligence agency.During the recent pause in fighting, dozens of armed, balaclava-clad militants appeared in a main square to hand over hostages, pointing to the group’s continued presence in what was once the enclave’s largest city.The Israeli military has so far skirted Hamas’s known military strongholds there, including Shejaiya — where some of the most intense battles of Operation Cast Lead took place in 2014, and where Hamas probably has dug in for a fight.“It will be very tough,” Milshtein said of the potential battle in the area, adding that Hamas “really prepared all their infrastructure.”Satellite imagery taken by Planet Labs on Thursday — just before the end of the temporary pause in fighting — showed little sign of an Israeli military presence around the neighborhoods of Shejaiya or Jabalya, another neighborhood in the east.But the areas have been the focus of heavy bombardment and raids since the return to fighting late last week. “This is a final announcement: You are all targets,” Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesperson, posted Sunday on X, addressing militants in Shejaiya.The IDF said it conducted a raid in Jabalya on Monday after “completing the encirclement” of the local refugee camp.“The deadliest battle may be ahead of us,” said Michael A. Horowitz, head of intelligence at risk consultancy Le Beck International. Hamas appears to have avoided direct confrontations so far, he said, but “they are going to be cornered and they are going to have to fight.”Though Israel is currently pounding the south with airstrikes and casualties are climbing, international pressure will make it hard for the IDF to replicate its northern strategy over the long term, he said, with the campaign more likely to focus on raids and counterinsurgency operations. “Most likely there’s going to be some form of a lower-level counterinsurgency campaign for the coming months,” he said.An Israeli security official echoed that assessment: “Our operations will be very different to how we’ve operated in Gaza City, because it is much more overcrowded,” they said.The Israeli security officials acknowledge the 5,000 figure provided for dead fighters is only an estimate.“We’re working on the intelligence, analyzing it and understanding how many and where they were killed,” one of the officials said.The count is complicated by the fact that many militants are believed to have been killed underground in tunnels. Israeli estimates are based in part on intercepts of Hamas’s own assessments, the official added.Hamas officials have not released figures for their war dead and declined to comment for this article. “We only have one source, and that’s the IDF who are interested to, in many ways, to up the numbers,” Horowitz said.Hamas is believed to have anywhere between 27,000 and 40,000 fighters, and analysts say it has easy access to recruits.But the overall number of foot soldiers is less important to Israel than decapitating Hamas’s leadership, particularly Yehiya Sinwar, the Hamas chief in Gaza whom the Israeli military has described as a “dead man walking.”“They are the ones who are their symbols; they’re the ones who have the authority to rule the Strip,” said Eyal Hulata, the head of Israel’s National Security Council until earlier this year. “So that’s the main operational goal at the moment, and they’ve all fled to the south, that’s very clear.”The Israeli military has dedicated large amounts of intelligence manpower to pinpointing the whereabouts of Sinwar, as well as other key leaders such as Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas’s military wing.“This war can change in forms, it can be different levels of intensity, but we will continue to conduct it until we get them,” Hulata said.Hamas is believed to have hundreds of miles of tunnels that snake under Gaza, and they are among its most vital military assets, allowing the group to transport weapons and fighters undetected.“One of the goals is to get where the tunnels are,” said Horowitz, noting that the underground network cannot be easily fixed or replaced in the middle of a conflict.Military officials have put the number of tunnel shafts discovered so far at 800, with 500 already destroyed. They have declined to comment on reports that a plan is being considered to use pumps to flood the tunnels with seawater.It’s difficult to gauge how much of an impact Israel has been able to make on the tunnel system as a whole, said Horowitz. “We don’t know how many shafts there are for each tunnel,” he said.While some may be small, intended for one-off attacks, others are thought to be dozens of meters deep and connected to larger networks. Horowitz’s firm estimates that about a third of Gaza’s tunnel system remains intact.Despite two months of intense fighting, Hamas remains capable of firing rockets toward Israel. Several barrages were unleashed toward southern Israel on Tuesday, with one hitting a residential building in the city of Ashkelon.Still, sirens in more distant cities, such as Tel Aviv, have been rare in recent weeks, and the number of rockets fired from Gaza has dropped from thousands in the first hours of the war to dozens a day. The country’s Iron Dome air defense system ensures the vast majority of rockets are intercepted.“There’s been a real decrease,” said Horowitz. “The question is why. It could be that Israel is really striking Hamas very hard and that the rocket arsenal of Hamas is decreasing very significantly. But it could be that Hamas is also pacing itself.”Before the war, Israeli intelligence estimated that Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Gaza had an arsenal of about 30,000 rockets. Israeli authorities say militants have fired more than 11,500 toward Israel since Oct. 7.It will be difficult for Israel to completely destroy Hamas’s rocket capabilities, Horowitz said, as many are produced locally.“You need to actually go and find the rocket making factories and disrupt the flow of material. It really takes a long time. To really have a day where Hamas can fire zero rockets toward Israel, that’s a day that’s difficult to achieve.”",7911,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/05/israel-military-offensive-hamas-destruction-gaza/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dead civilian anonymity sinwar deadliest change national ongoing replace hour ensures child time group complicate influence airstrikes capability hamas tough decline arm firm discover jabalya ministry security deep arsenal remains release horowitz particularly soldier hostage fight tel heavily intensity north question conduct analyze factory hard deif system minimize yehiya dug spoke operational cost decrease term note easily enclave accord destruction country ground force flood intelligence month report majority zero front flee area raid weapon strategy source easy south fortify leadership pump risk comment northern haul hulata bombardment provide wing military probably x address mile thursday target campaign return pace foot connect milshtein impact southern control asset plan article corner pinpoint number encirclement small base avichay neighborhood complete replicate macron day continued spokesperson material rule devastate hit point department form intercept large idf real planet counterinsurgency militant leader fix diplomatic satellite skirt make show disrupt spearhead enter intense prepared former completely snake strike palestinian dozen maintain refugee long residential transport gauge authority leave lab attack significantly produce goal distant monday shejaiya described define united whereabouts underground fact casualty temporary discus dedicate late total possible avoid vital believe gaza international find key thousand announcement confrontation council operation important difficult consider iron fighter battle adraee faction emmanuel year state decapitate hand assessment amount network tunnel focus intend cast city aviv building shaft official israel detail heavy expect local support final barrage michael recent condition direct siren beck presence meter air flow potential continue analyst different include place clock hecht open access currently fire objective death unleashed pound middle square acknowledge count richard mohammed lead drop symbol interested destroy figure part climb destroyed level understand chief post capable spokesman imagery defense vast dome ahead earlier hundred stronghold sunday reach kill rare strip head moment achieve manpower sign overcrowd israeli put rocket eyal add echoed washington consultancy pause french operate estimate work pressure president week tuesday,-0.98655,0.3033750474023511,9.65742363877822,0.4607411851433592,0,2023-12-05
Reuters,"Mathematics, reading skills in unprecedented decline in teenagers - OECD survey",2023-12-05 10:18:00,Leigh Thomas,"PARIS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Teenagers' mathematics and reading skills are in an unprecedented decline across dozens of countries and COVID school closures are only partly to be blamed, the OECD said on Tuesday in its latest survey of global learning standards.The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said it had seen some of the steepest drops in performance since 2000 when it began its usually triennial tests of 15-year-olds reading, maths and science skills.Nearly 700,000 youths took the two-hour test last year in the OECD's 38 mostly developed country members and 44-non members for the latest study, closely watched by policymakers as the largest international comparison of education performance.Compared to when the tests were last conducted in 2018, reading performance fell by 10 points on average in OECD countries, and by 15 points in mathematics, a loss equivalent to three-quarters of a year's worth of learning.While more than half of the 81 countries surveyed saw declines, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland saw particularly sharp drops in mathematics scores, the OECD said.On average across the OECD, one out of four 15-year-olds tested as a low performer in maths, reading and science, which means they could not use basic algorithms or interpret simple texts, the study found.""COVID probably played some role but I would not overrate it,"" OECD director of education Andreas Schleicher told a news conference.""There are underlying structural factors and they are much more likely to be permanent features of our education systems that policymakers should really take seriously.""Countries that provided extra teacher support during COVID school closures scored better and results were generally better in places where easy teacher access for special help was high.Poorer results tended to be associated with higher rates of mobile phone use for leisure and where schools reported teacher shortages.The OECD said the decline was not inevitable, pointing to Singapore, where students scored the highest in maths, reading and science, with results that suggested they were on average three to five years ahead of their OECD peers.",2192,https://www.reuters.com/world/mathematics-reading-skills-unprecedented-decline-teenagers-oecd-survey-2023-12-05/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/GNI45R2JGBOXRLR6M7TNJHUOCQ.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,result survey report teenager developed teacher country math large study learn germany leisure drop probably cooperation dozen associate decline steepest tend late iceland international schleicher easy access poland netherlands particularly sharp performance mobile ahead global feature permanent role performer basic oecd andreas organisation policymakers watch underlie structural economic overrate factor tuesday mathematics closure comparison peer paris inevitable point extra support conduct conference dec loss skill reading interpret triennial system provide score member closely place covid played school fell generally year begin high half suggest science simple singapore director partly algorithm found rate blame special unprecedented low text development youth told news test education average norway phone worth student equivalent reuters,0.77055,0.4105839416058393,13.126203208556152,0.4516741071428571,0,2023-12-05
Reuters,UK home secretary set to sign new asylum treaty in Rwanda,2023-12-05 10:09:00,"Andrew Macaskill, Michael Holden","LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - British Home Secretary James Cleverly arrived in Rwanda on Tuesday to sign a new treaty to send asylum seekers to the African nation after the UK's top court declared the deportation scheme unlawful.The Rwanda plan is at the centre of the government's strategy to cut migration and is being watched closely by other countries considering similar policies.But the United Kingdom's Supreme Court last month ruled that such a move would violate international human rights laws enshrined in domestic legislation.Since that ruling, Britain has been seeking to renegotiate its agreement with Rwanda to include a binding treaty that it would not expel asylum seekers sent there by Britain - one of the court's major concerns.Cleverly, who arrived in Rwanda's capital Kigali on Tuesday morning, is due to meet with the country's foreign minister, Vincent Biruta, to sign the agreement.""Rwanda cares deeply about the rights of refugees, and I look forward to meeting with counterparts to sign this agreement and further discuss how we work together to tackle the global challenge of illegal migration,"" Cleverly said.Under the plan, Britain intends to send thousands of asylum seekers who arrived on its shores without permission to Rwanda to deter migrants crossing the Channel from Europe in small boats.In return, Rwanda has received an initial payment of 140 million pounds ($180 million) with the promise of more money to fund the accommodation and care of any deported individuals.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is under intense pressure to cut net migration, which hit a record 745,000 last year, and end the flow of asylum seekers who pay people smugglers for their Channel crossings, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.Britain's immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the government had to act because those arriving on small boats were effectively breaking into the country.""The law says you can't enter the country illegally. If you or I crossed an international border, we literally broke into another country, we would expect to be treated very seriously,"" he told Sky News.The vast majority of those arriving in Britain came via legal routes, and the government also announced plans to cut those numbers on Monday, raising the minimum salary they must earn in a skilled job.Ministers are also expected to publish new legislation soon, declaring Rwanda a so-called safe country, designed to stop legal challenges against the planned deportation flights.""Stop the boats"" is one of five goals Sunak set for his government before a national election expected next year.The Supreme Court ruled the government's scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful because there was a risk that deported refugees would have their claims wrongly assessed or returned to their country of origin to face persecution.The court said the plan breached international undertakings - including the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Nations' Refugee Convention and Convention against Torture.There are growing tensions in the Conservative Party over how to respond, with some members of parliament putting pressure on the government to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, after the European Court of Human Rights originally blocked deportation flights from leaving.This year almost 29,000 people have arrived on the southern English coast without permission, after a record 45,755 were detected in 2022.",3446,https://www.reuters.com/world/uks-cleverly-sign-new-asylum-treaty-with-rwanda-2023-12-05/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/K3CZQDFAEJN2TBJPAM5Z7HO4XQ.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,literally southern rishi tackle fund deport net enshrine kigali flow hit country migrant plan deter goal treaty salary initial payment discus border announce law counterpart james rule cut binding arrive deeply tension unseaworthy effectively expect migration consider similar seek immigration legislation international capital ruling origin african grow asylum nation home secretary originally sign global number meet london break top permission detect legal assess agreement crossing respond morning receive expel record sunak watch majority thousand money sky shore domestic tuesday violate small united uk parliament million treat month refugee intense minister election british minimum set dec rwanda channel boat breach return human strategy undertaking europe member closely renegotiate cleverly major national cross centre biruta party claim challenge kingdom stop year due court jenrick publish deportation english seeker illegally raise work broke declare promise earn smuggler overcrowd scheme vast design include risk illegal wrongly leave government move vincent safe told pressure robert act forward accommodation pay european pound block unlawful enter skilled conservative send flight meeting convention coast monday britain intend supreme foreign route reuters put,0.5553,0.522344747533372,13.138299319727892,0.327465834818776,0,2023-12-05

County District Attorney's Office said in a press statement.Powell is accused of killing three homeless men in three separate shootings as the victims slept alone on a sidewalk or alley in the early morning hours of last week, from Nov. 26 through Nov. 29, the district attorney's office said.A fourth man, described in local media reports as a project manager in the county executive's office, was followed by the suspect as he drove from a vehicle-charging station to his home in suburban San Dimas, then was robbed and shot to death, prosecutors said.A combination of surveillance video and license plate-reading technology identified the car Powell was believed to have driven and led to his arrest in Beverly Hills on Nov. 30 as a suspect in the follow-home killing, the Los Angeles City News Service (CNS) reported, citing law enforcement officials.A handgun found in the suspect's car has since been linked to all four killings, authorities said according to CNS.Powell was charged with four counts of murder, one count of residential robbery and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. It was not known if he had obtained legal representation following his arrest.A judge on Monday ordered he remain held without bail until an arraignment set for Jan. 8, CNS said.Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said there was no known connection among the four men who were slain and suggested that additional victims might end up linked to the case.""Based on his criminal history, he didn't just start doing this a week ago,"" Luna said.",1992,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/suspected-la-area-serial-killer-charged-4-killings-including-3-homeless-men-2023-12-05/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/J7XT5LWZG5NCFN4GVJTYU5J3BQ.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,believe report combination link joseph sidewalk week alley criminal convict office law killing press station history angeles judge district remain bail representation home serial residence parole robbed robbery hill fourth charge drove car legal morning hour technology victim suspect fatal local ago official possibility arraignment additional service homeless obtain surveillance held base death manager powell prosecutor set accuse dec arrest jerrid shooting executive enforcement described city maximum accord separate driven prison sentence case video county employee authority beverly cns connection residential suggest handgun count felon kill early slain found attorney order murder identify suburban sheriff san life follow license firearm lead dimas robert news project shot killer slept medium span possession start luna monday reuters,-0.99315,0.7530120481927711,10.270080862533696,0.1351851851851851,0,2023-12-05

CNN,"‘It’s chaos:’ Starving Gazans dig for food, supplies under the rubble",2023-12-05 08:32:00,Nadeen Ebrahim,"One man carries six jars of cooking oil as he struggles to walk across the rubble. Two little girls run as they each carry stacks of white paper, used to build fire for heat and cooking. A group of men argue, elbowing each other as they battle to find a bag of flour, some tea or even a forgotten blanket.These are the scenes from the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah, where an apparent Israeli airstrike on Monday destroyed not only homes and streets, but also the neighborhood’s Al-Baraka bakery, one of the few still standing in the Strip.In response to CNN questions about the bakery, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said Tuesday that “in stark contrast to Hamas’ intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.”Dier al-Balah is in the center of the Strip, an area that is coming under increasing Israeli bombardment. Israel has also called on Palestinians in some parts of southern Gaza to leave, issuing digital maps that residents tell CNN are either confusing or to which they don’t have access because of a lack of electricity and internet connectivity. The IDF had earlier in the war encouraged Gazans to move to the southern part of the Strip for their safety, while committing to strike at Hamas “wherever it is.”The strike in Dier al-Balah occurred overnight, according to residents, and by morning men, women and children were digging through the rubble. But this time, the residents weren’t digging to find loved ones. They were desperately searching for food and other essential supplies.As the Israel-Hamas war enters its ninth week, signs are emerging of social order breaking down, with reports of looting by people struggling to survive. Since October 9, Israel has blocked access to water, food and electricity in the Strip that is home to more than 2 million Palestinians.More than 15,899 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel started its campaign there, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza.In late October, the United Nations warned that order may be breaking down as thousands of desperate Palestinians were taking basic items like flour and hygiene supplies from warehouses. “People are scared, frustrated and desperate,” Thomas White, director of affairs in Gaza for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), said at the time.“It’s chaos,” one resident told CNN Monday, standing behind a crowd of people scavenging for supplies under the damage. An orphanage was also struck, he said.Kamil Al-Raie, another resident who has lived on the street since 2006 and whose home was destroyed in the strike, told CNN that hunger had driven Gazans to such desperate measures.“Look at the people,” he said, referring to the crowd of Palestinians digging through the rubble. “This is all from hunger.”Gaza’s entire population is in need of food assistance, according to the World Food Programme (WFP), adding that at the start of the current crisis, the relief organization was operating with 23 bakeries.“But food systems are collapsing. The last bakery that WFP had been working with was shut down because it had no fuel or gas,” the UN agency says on its website.Al-Baraka bakery used to ease people’s suffering by providing much-needed bread, said Ibrahim Dabbour, another resident of Deir al-Balah. “The bakery should be outside of military operation,” he added.“Striking it (the bakery) should be considered terrorism, to be honest,” Dabbour told CNN.A day after the IDF said it was expanding its ground operation, it said it struck about 200 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. Its targets included a school in the northeastern city of Beit Hanoun, which the IDF claimed contained “terror infrastructure,” including tunnel shafts stocked with weapons and explosives, a vehicle holding weapons and an arms storage facility.The Israeli navy also struck a number of targets overnight, “assisting with the reinforcement of ground troops,” the IDF said.The strikes come in the wake of the resumption of Israel’s military campaign against Hamas after the collapse of a truce between both sides. Israel has made it clear that its next phase will include the entire territory, including parts of southern Gaza, where thousands of displaced Palestinians fleeing the fighting in the north have been sheltering.While the United States has warned Israel to minimize civilian casualties in the south, Israel is bent on destroying Hamas after the militant group’s October 7 assault, in which the militant group killed approximately 1,200 in Israel and kidnapped around 240 others.While Gazans often heed Israel’s calls to evacuate, many say that wherever they go, they are haunted by the prospect of death – whether it is by airstrike or starvation.The Israeli military has repeatedly dropped leaflets over the southern city of Khan Younis in recent days, calling the area a “fighting zone” and telling residents to “evacuate immediately.”On Sunday, the IDF again told people to evacuate several areas southeast of Khan Younis, instructing citizens to move further south. Southern Gaza had been designated a safe area when Israel was conducting its operation in the north, prompting more than 1 million people to move there from the north.The instructions were repeated on social media, where the Israeli military Friday published a new map of Gaza, dividing the Strip into hundreds of numbered sectors which it called “evacuation zones.”Critics have said the map is confusing and inaccurate.“The Israeli army is again telling people in Khan Younis to flee,” Sari Bashi, program director at Human Rights Watch, said on X, formerly Twitter, commenting on an IDF image of one of the maps, which divides neighborhoods into blocks. “Again, the map contradicts the written instructions (What’s up with blocks 55? 38-46?).“They know there’s no safe place to go and no safe way to get there,” Bashi added.But few Palestinians have been able to make use of Israel’s map. Some have not seen the leaflets, while those who have say they have neither power nor internet access to scan the barcode, as Israel has cut off both.Israel said it would use the map to advise people on where to evacuate.The leaflets Israel has dropped include a QR code, which when scanned with a smart phone shows a map of the Gaza Strip, marked like a grid showing what Israel says are safe and unsafe zones for civilians.Many other Gazans, living in poverty, are not in possession of smart phones.“There is no electricity, there is no internet,” said Khalil Abu Marahil, adding that since his evacuation from Gaza City, he and many others have relied on leaflets, radios in hospitals or word of mouth for news.“It’s been a while since we have used Facebook,” he told CNN.Apart from leaflets, residents are often told to evacuate certain areas by receiving a phone call from the Israeli military, they told CNN, referring to their early evacuations from the north.Around 1.9 million people, more than 80% of Gaza’s total population, have been internally displaced across the Gaza Strip since October 7, according to UNRWA, which estimates that nearly 1 million people are sheltering in facilities in central and south Gaza, including Khan Younis and Rafah.“We’ve had no internet for the 50 days now,” Sally Essam, a displaced Palestinian currently residing in Deir al-Balah, said. “Only God knows where next after Deir al-Balah.”",7473,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/middleeast/gaza-bakery-hunger-israel-hamas-war-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204170244-gaza-bakery-looting-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,airstrike apparent phase wfp civilian side increase leaflet mouth central child home time shelter phone group vehicle troop hamas nation resumption arm flour ministry designate publish honest item programme scar desperate damage elbow contradicts essam connectivity issue refer divide possession fight evacuate argue love poverty tea struggle north question gazan conduct build run system terrorism sari minimize desperately palestine stark haunt bashi white southeast critic lack citizen water instruction accord force ground bent report truce prompt flee deir hanoun area feasible heat weapon live god human south street abu order storage comment loot bombardment claimed provide emerge military x chaos army commit target campaign khan search receive warn agency explosive beit southern operating affair frustrate cooking orphanage medium number scan wake precaution follow internet crowd health neighborhood entire hospital world evacuation day word expand radio occur younis reside northeastern idf rely safe militant director make show jar clear digital assistance electricity law strike palestinian ibrahim living reinforcement refugee response internally forgotten stand suffer leave safety map attack repeat monday gas thomas united start casualty million late total sally grid collapse barcode gaza current international scene resident girl bakery find warehouse thousand approximately operation image consider rubble break stock battle walk sector instruct told organization twitter cnn state mitigate infrastructure population tunnel friday program move marked bag facility city write essential prospect shaft israel bread heed basic carry woman hold stack unrwa east october fuel crisis recent khalil kidnap formerly territory cut center early block include place facebook encourage access currently marahil contain fire death paper code oil terror food social hygiene ease morning navy watch supply repeatedly ninth advise hunger qr drop displace unsafe survive destroy part numbered relief driven smart power destroyed shut confuse defense dabbour gazans earlier hundred struck scavenge sunday kill call strip sign school israeli zone add assault assist enters overnight estimate intentional work contrast dier tuesday week,-0.9971,0.2408671216378964,9.590399999999995,0.3626359106010269,0,2023-12-05

NPR,"Israel is expanding its offensive in Gaza, forcing more Palestinians to flee south",2023-12-05 07:37:00,Scott Neuman,"Daniel Estrin An Israeli artillery unit is pictured near the border with the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, amid continuing battles between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP via Getty Images hide caption An Israeli artillery unit is pictured near the border with the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, amid continuing battles between Israel and the militant group Hamas. JERUSALEM — Israel's military on Tuesday appeared to be encircling Gaza's second largest city, Khan Younis, pushing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians deeper south and hobbling international relief groups already struggling to deliver aid to the besieged territory. While the Israel Defense Forces expanded its offensive in northern and central Gaza, it said it had raided the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza for the first time in pursuit of Hamas targets. Meanwhile, Palestinian residents said Israeli troops have advanced near Khan Younis, a Hamas stronghold that is home to the top Hamas leader in the territory. The heavy fighting overnight forced many to flee to the southern city of Rafah, along the Egyptian border. UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency that aids Palestinians, put the humanitarian concerns bluntly: ""We have said it repeatedly. We are saying it again. No place is safe in Gaza."" ""The level of human suffering is intolerable. The resumption of the military operation and its expansion further in southern Gaza is repeating horrors from past weeks,"" it said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Satellite images taken Sunday showed Israeli troops massing outside Khan Younis, according to The Associated Press. The city had a pre-invasion population of more than 400,000 people. More than three-quarters of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by the Israeli offensive, which was launched in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people. Israel's air and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 15,000 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-governed Gaza. In a statement on Tuesday, Israel's military said that since the beginning of ground operations in Gaza some five weeks ago, it had fired 100,000 artillery shells in the territory that occupies just 140 square miles. The heightened Israeli bombardment came as Israel has been under pressure from the U.S. to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza and international relief groups said they were finding it increasingly difficult to distribute aid to refugees from the fighting. The head of UNRWA said Israel's bombardment of southern Gaza was further strangling aid deliveries and increasing ""mass displacement"" of Palestinians. ""The number of civilians killed is rapidly increasing. Civilians, including men, women, children, older persons, the sick and people with disabilities are the most to suffer,"" Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said Monday. UNRWA warned that 600,ooo Palestinians in Gaza had been ordered to move to avoid death and injury amid the Israeli bombardment. The agency said an influx of people internally displaced by the conflict to Rafah, Gaza's southernmost governorate, could more than double the area's normal population, further straining relief efforts. The Palestinian Red Crescent Societies (PRCS) on Tuesday said Israeli tanks had targeted ""the vicinity area of two PRCS ambulances,"" as the injured and dead were being transported. It said the attack occurred in central Gaza near the city of Deir al Balah. ""One paramedic was lightly injured and the ambulances were damaged,"" it said. The PRCS also said it had ""lost contact"" with its operations room in Gaza due to a telecommunications blackout. It expressed concern for the safety of its teams in Gaza ""amidst the ongoing and intense Israeli airstrikes around the clock"" and worried about its ability to continue to provide emergency services,"" adding that a lack of communications ""hinders the arrival of ambulances to the injured and wounded."" Meanwhile, the director-general of the World Health Organization said that Israel's military had notified the WHO of the need to ""remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use."" ""We appeal to Israel to withdraw the order, and take every possible measure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and humanitarian facilities,"" wrote Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a post on X. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), a unit of the Ministry of Defense, said Tuesday that 180 aid trucks carrying food, water, shelter equipment and medical supplies were dispatched through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. In addition, two diesel fuel tankers were sent, a COGAT spokesperson said. The fuel is ""designated for the operation of vital infrastructure in the Gaza Strip,"" the spokesperson said.

Fox News,Israel constructs large pumps to flood Hamas terror tunnels with seawater: Wall Street Journal,2023-12-05 07:25:00,Chris Pandolfo,"The Israeli military has assembled several large pumps it could use to flood the Hamas tunnels beneath the Gaza Strip with seawater, driving out terrorists hiding there, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing U.S. officials.Construction of five large seawater pumps was completed in November about one mile north of the Al-Shati refugee camp. Each pump is capable of drawing water from the Mediterranean Sea and can move thousands of cubic meters of water per hour, which would flood the tunnels within weeks, the report said.Israel has not yet committed to the plan, and it is unclear whether it would attempt to flood the tunnels while there are still hostages, including Americans, held by Hamas. The Palestinian terror group took some 240 people captive during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and brought them back to the Gaza Strip.According to the report, Israel has identified about 800 tunnels beneath Gaza that Hamas has used to move fighters, store weapons and plan terror attacks on Israel. However, Israeli officials believe the tunnel network is much larger.ISRAEL LAUNCHES 10,000TH AIRSTRIKE AGAINST HAMAS, AS PALESTINIANS SEEK SHELTER IN CROWDED SOUTHERN GAZAIsraeli soldiers operate at the opening to a tunnel at Al Shifa Hospital compound in Gaza City, amid the ongoing ground operation of the Israeli army against Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in the Gaza Strip, November 22, 2023.

Reuters,GM's Cruise may face fines for 'misleading' regulator over accident,2023-12-05 05:44:00,"Joseph White, Hyunjoo Jin, David Shepardson","Dec 4 (Reuters) - General Motors' (GM.N) Cruise robotaxi unit could face $1.5 million in fines and additional sanctions over its failure to disclose details of an Oct. 2 accident in which a robotaxi dragged a pedestrian 20 feet (6.1 meters) after being struck by another vehicle, a California agency said.Separately, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said on Monday that the automaker's external review of Cruise's safety will last into the first quarter of 2024.The company is also reviewing Cruise's handling of interactions with regulators and first responders as part of a pair of external reviews. ""We will be transparent. I am not going to rush either of them,"" Barra said.The growing regulatory pressure could hamper GM and Cruise's effort to rebuild trust and restart operations in California after coming under fire for allegedly withholding information about the crash in San Francisco.Last month, Cruise paused all driverless and supervised car trips in the United States and expanded a safety review of its robotaxis, and CEO Kyle Vogt and chief product officer Daniel Kan both stepped down.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in a document dated Friday ordered Cruise to appear at a Feb. 6 hearing for ""misleading the Commission through omission regarding the extent and seriousness of the accident"" and ""making misleading public comments regarding its interactions with the commission."" The order was by a CPUC administrative law judge and a commissioner.Forbes reported the CPUC news earlier on Monday.On Oct. 3, Jose Alvarado, a senior manager of government affairs at Cruise, telephoned commission analyst Ashlyn Kong and informed her of the collision, according to the ruling. The description ""omitted that the Cruise AV had engaged in the pullover maneuver which resulted in the pedestrian being dragged an additional 20 feet at 7 mph (11.27 km per hour),"" the documents said, using the abbreviation AV for autonomous vehicle.Kong said in a Nov. 8 statement that Cruise's blog posting that it “proactively” shared information with the commission “including the full video"" is ""inaccurate.""""The full video was shared only in response to a data request more than two weeks after the incident,"" she said.""Cruise is committed to rebuilding trust with our regulators and will respond in a timely manner to the CPUC,"" the company said in a statement.The San Francisco skyline is seen behind a self-driving GM Bolt EV during a media event where Cruise, GM's autonomous car unit, showed off its self-driving cars in San Francisco, California, U.S. November 28, 2017. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsIn an appearance at the Detroit Automotive Press Association on Monday, GM's Barra declined to say what level of losses she could accept at Cruise going forward. Cruise, which is cutting jobs, lost more than $700 million in the third quarter and more than $8 billion since 2016.""I would call it an investment not a loss,"" Barra said. ""We have to have the right plan. We have to communicate it ... and we will do that at the appropriate time.""But GM investors said it will take time for Cruise to turn around.""I don't think there's any expectation from our standpoint that this is going to be a one-, two-, three- or even six-month issue,"" said portfolio manager Tim Piechowski at ACR Alpine Capital Research, which has a $290 million in investment in GM. ""It's going to be a longer time item for them to repair.""The California commission has the authority to fine a public utility up to $100,000 per day if there is a violation plus other penalties, according to the judge's order. The CPUC said in its Friday ruling that Cruise took 15 days to give a full account of the accident. That could lead to a fine of up to $1.5 million.CPUC commissioners in August voted in favor of a plan by Cruise and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Waymo to take paying passengers day or night throughout San Francisco, despite vigorous opposition from some residents and city agencies.In October, California's Department of Motor Vehicles barred Cruise self-driving vehicles from public roads following the accident.Cruise's troubles are also a setback for an industry dependent on public trust and the cooperation of regulators. The company had in recent months touted ambitious plans to expand to more cities, offering fully autonomous taxi rides. GM had told investors Cruise and its technology could generate $50 billion a year in revenue by 2030.GM has hired an outside law firm to conduct a review of Cruise management's handling of the Oct. 2 incident and the response to regulators. Cruise has also said it is planning to relaunch in one unspecified city before expanding to others.By Dec. 18, GM is supposed to hand-deliver a ""verified statement"" which includes facts and arguments regarding CPUC's charges, all attachments, along with a three-ringed binder containing a copy of all authorities, to the administrative judge.",4952,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/gm-cruise-could-face-state-fines-over-oct-2-pedestrian-accident-2023-12-04/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/XB27RMBHPZME5FHOS5XPNTLP5U.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,share incident report expectation disclose penalty august pair waymo planning meter firm company detail sanction kyle week date law analyst press cut despite make turn decline earlier interaction barra capital regard abbreviation regulator management cruise ev km alpine commit account opposition driverless automotive agency respond technology data vogt photo ashlyn united million general verify supervise pullover standpoint jose dependent loss collision maneuver effort restart executive document response violation fully quarter daniel attachment trip portfolio cpuc regulatory omit resident authority hire withholding part fire allegedly full tout rightsin accept san investor state francisco suppose detroit follow told pressure copy news information pay timely show billion statement road fact safety bar vote monday robotaxis external reuters communicate result october transparent fine mph hamper crash setback drag call plan pedestrian night favor investment trust foot senior longer give tim time cooperation public judge ceo seriousness robotaxi skyline officer ruling grow contain automaker acr ride generate comment post repair department california charge car autonomous step appropriate hour issue friday kong unspecified inform trouble association additional rebuild telephone failure ambitious revenue argument blog proactively manager piechowski month commissioner request event conduct dec acquire research bolt city accord chief binder motor affair hearing mislead video extent day year alvarado pause taxi gm item administrative order level industry include utility product government commission responder struck lead handle appearance vehicle alphabet forward job mary inaccurate passenger description operation offering medium rush licensing relaunch unit omission expand manner engage recent accident lose november review vigorous,-0.62515,0.0,10.15536294691224,0.394141604010025,0,2023-12-05

NPR,These were NPR.org's biggest international stories in 2023,2023-12-05 05:08:00,John Helton,"A salvo of rockets is fired by Palestinian militants from Gaza toward Israel on Oct. 10. Hamas' unprecedented attack on Israel started Oct. 7. A senior Hamas official told NPR that its planning was kept a close secret. Mahmud Hams/AFP via Getty Images hide caption A salvo of rockets is fired by Palestinian militants from Gaza toward Israel on Oct. 10. Hamas' unprecedented attack on Israel started Oct. 7. A senior Hamas official told NPR that its planning was kept a close secret. On Oct. 7, Hamas militants surged over the Gaza border into Israel attacking a music concert, military bases and people in their homes. Israel says some 2,000 militants killed around 1,200 men, women and children — taking about 240 hostage. Israel responded within hours with airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, vowing to destroy Hamas and rescue hostages. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed, ""Every Hamas member is a dead man,"" after forming an emergency government and wartime cabinet. For weeks, Israel's military pounded Gaza with artillery and airstrikes. Then it launched a ground offensive, sending troops into Gaza to divide it between north and south. The United Nations says 40,000 homes have been destroyed along with bakeries, schools and hospitals, and Gaza health officials say Israeli attacks have killed at least 15,000 people and wounded 40,000 others. The two sides agreed to a temporary cease-fire and an exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons in late November, but after three extensions of the original four-day agreement, talks fell apart last week and Israel resumed its attacks in Gaza. In addition to our coverage of developments in Israel and Gaza, the West Bank and southern Lebanon, where Israel has battled Hezbollah militants, we provided some context around those events. Russia's invasion of Ukraine ground on through the year with neither side able to break through and the approaching winter slowing combat operations on both sides. The year started with Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaiming a cease-fire that wasn't — and Ukraine never agreeing to one in the first place, although both sides accused the other of violating it. In March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for alleged war crimes involving accusations that Russia has forcibly taken Ukrainian children. War fatigue is starting to set in among some of its neighbors, while in a divided Washington, D.C., some — particularly Republicans — are turning against President Biden's commitment to continue to provide arms and ammunition to Ukraine. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the city center two days after the destructive Feb. 6 earthquake in Kahramanmaras, southern Turkey. Turkish Presidency via AP hide caption Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the city center two days after the destructive Feb. 6 earthquake in Kahramanmaras, southern Turkey. As Turkey struggled in the aftermath of a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in February that killed 35,000 people there and in neighboring Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said no government could have been ready for a disaster of such magnitude. But then videos emerged showing Erdogan bragging about the ""zoning amnesty"" he granted to builders that allowed them to ignore the safety codes that had been put on the books specifically to make apartment blocks, houses and office buildings more resistant to earthquakes. Critics say contractors were allowed to skip crucial safety regulations, increasing their profits but putting residents at risk. Engineers and architects say the lack of safety features designed to absorb the shock of earthquakes likely contributed to the death toll. The revelations fueled public outrage over slow efforts to help residents in the aftermath, which left many injured and without a home, food or heating in the middle of winter. Alix Dorsainvil, originally from New Hampshire, was working as a community health nurse for a Christian organization in Haiti when she and her daughter were taken in July from El Roi Haiti's campus in a gang-controlled area near Port-au-Prince. They were released 13 days later. Who kidnapped them and why remains unclear. El Roi Haiti said Dorsainvil fell in love with Haiti's people on a visit there after the devastating 2010 earthquake hit the Caribbean nation. She's also married to the group's founder and director, Sandro Dorsainvil, who grew up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. In her first appearance after her release, Dorsainvil told her captors, ""I want you guys to know that everything I said during my time in captivity was sincere,"" she said in Haitian Creole in a video on El Roi Haiti's site. ""I love you in Christ, and one day I hope to hug you in heaven."" Zerzevan Castle, the site of a Roman Empire military garrison, is providing what UNESCO calls ""important information about the Roman soldiers, civilians' daily lives and the battles."" Alice Martins for NPR hide caption Zerzevan Castle, the site of a Roman Empire military garrison, is providing what UNESCO calls ""important information about the Roman soldiers, civilians' daily lives and the battles."" Archaeologists told us that recent finds in southeastern Turkey promise to change our understanding of Mesopotamia's history. Zerzevan Castle, the site of a Roman Empire military garrison, has changed our understanding of pre-Roman activity in the area. UNESCO says it provides ""important information about the Roman soldiers, civilians' daily lives and the battles."" The Mithras religion — also known as the ""Mithras cult"" — is believed to have originated in ancient Persia, and the Mithras Temple, discovered six years ago, is possibly the best-preserved such temple in the world, UNESCO says. There's still much to be uncovered at the site: There are huge, multistory structures that archaeologists have identified with ground-penetrating radar scans. They are revealing layer upon layer of artifacts, some dating back well into pre-Roman history. Rudolf Erasmus was piloting a private flight from South Africa's Western Cape to the northeastern town of Nelspruit in April when he felt a cold sensation under his shirt near what he called his ""love handles."" When he looked down for the source, he was surprised to see a Cape cobra, whose bite can kill someone in as little as an hour, under his seat. Concerned about what the snake might do and the safety of his passengers, Erasmus turned the plane around and made an emergency landing in Welkom, the nearest airport. Erasmus said he had seen the cult 2006 film Snakes on a Plane, and the expletive-laden tirade Samuel L. Jackson's FBI agent unleashes when he discovers the plane he's on is full of venomous snakes played out in his head. ""That's how I felt at some point,"" he said, laughing. South African civil aviation commissioner Poppy Khoza praised Erasmus as ""a hero"" and said he ""saved all lives on board."" The cobra escaped. In October we told the story of a group of heritage trade craftspeople and history buffs that are building a castle in the Burgundy region of France using tools and construction methods from the 13th century. Matisse Lacroix, 20, a blacksmith at Guédelon Castle, works a large bellows to make the fire hot enough to melt iron and make it malleable. Cristina Baussan for NPR hide caption Matisse Lacroix, 20, a blacksmith at Guédelon Castle, works a large bellows to make the fire hot enough to melt iron and make it malleable. The idea to build Guédelon was born in 1995 among three friends, residents of the area who are also history buffs and nature lovers. One of the three owned a nearby 17th century château and was involved in work to restore different castles in the area. They laid the first stones in 1997, and the builders say it could take 10, 15, even 20 more years to build. One reason its construction is taking so long is that workers, dressed in medieval clothing and some mandated modern safety equipment, stop their work to explain what they're doing to visitors as well as train young craftsmen in heritage skills. A post shared by NPR (@npr) The project was initially financed by donations and some European Union funding. It's now financed through more than 300,000 paying visitors a year, which generate more than $5 million a year that largely covers pay for 100 staff members. Mexico's Congress took time away from pressing matters of state in September to hear testimony on extraterrestrials. Then came the big reveal. Remains of an allegedly ""nonhuman"" being were displayed during the briefing on unidentified flying objects at the San Lazaro legislative palace in Mexico City on Sept. 12. Henry Romero /Reuters hide caption Remains of an allegedly ""nonhuman"" being were displayed during the briefing on unidentified flying objects at the San Lazaro legislative palace in Mexico City on Sept. 12. As self-described ufologist Jaime Maussan spoke, two men uncovered caskets revealing two bodies, which Maussan said under oath were nonhuman. The corpses looked like stereotypical depictions of aliens — big head, little body, three fingers. Maussan said they were found in Peru in 2017 and are estimated to be 1,000 years old. Maussan and others have previously presented similar claims about alleged alien remains in the past. Scientists have dismissed them as either ancient Peruvian mummies or manipulated mummies. The hearing also included remarks by Ryan Graves, one of three U.S. veterans who testified in front of a U.S. congressional subcommittee investigating the existence of UFOs the same month, who later distanced himself from the hearing. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he wrote: ""Unfortunately, yesterday's demonstration was a huge step backwards for this issue ... I am deeply disappointed by this unsubstantiated stunt.""",9847,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1216262441/top-international-stories-2023,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/10/12/2023-10-12t160958z_1697126995_dpaf231012x911x014899_rtrfipp_4_conflict-war-politics-unrest-militaryequipment-defence_sq-ac81412b58db5972dc489f979c5efe4ee1a5fde4.jpg?s=100&c=15&f=jpeg,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,aftermath ukraine uncovered side civilian town staff crucial born change donation khoza blacksmith violate march home effort explain time winter hero troop skill arm kahramanmaras temple commissioner remains legislative release alice book issue activity distance hostage divide nelspruit big pay amnesty love north struggle set martin object cabinet mexico mithra artillery lacroix daughter erasmus spoke investigate music haiti possibly deeply bellow cold erdogan casket office month hear played train earthquake concert february front alien area save method west south close largely approach full presidency ammunition provide history ufologist x getty remark npr bragging craftspeople southern hearing contractor airport heritage unsubstantiated september away turkish scan finance base captor world day persia capital nearby modern malleable secret point ufo coverage form northeastern testimony absorb ignore syria director involve cristina make palace san share context vladimir emergency palestinian arrest subcommittee hot republican radar similar date guédelon discovers commitment testify original cult builder board lebanon grant million temporary architect late believe recep gaza roman roi find sensation break garrison year organization hope benjamin congressional seat finger video laid write offensive heating fly construction resistant restore haitian medieval poppy fuel kidnap formerly huge life venomous center christian information continue block jaime place mummy disappointed warrant death pound agree pilot july contribute buff european cobra land toll zerzevan hezbollah member injured laugh press destroy castle launch stereotypical fbi western caribbean proclaim handle post caption story visitor initially november call head veteran court put israeli rocket zone visit estimate work feature romero revelation president week dead vow campus reason increase shock unfortunately hour child body found worker praise nurse graf unesco group airstrikes hamas nation tool discover felt destructive craftsman apartment escape ukrainian nonhuman maussan rescue particularly soldier hide stone cape claim yesterday public ago engineer build henry ready tayyip development passenger critic lack regulation project captivity design founder ground daily planning bite unleashes samuel married displayed april originally guy slow putin dorsainvil originate source welkom allegedly risk dismiss peru send emerge demonstration military hampshire past stop melt archaeologist salvo surge turn surprised mahmud union christ mandate talk exchange sincere health hospital generate matter forcibly tirade mesopotamia vowed devastate hit senior large existence disaster matisse militant show crime grow dress unidentified agent creole reveal snake century multistory equipment russian long clothing structure ryan safety extraterrestrial attack agreement fell stunt community respond unclear invasion united netanyahu start allege friend fatigue bank specifically magnitude criminal border prison plane international resident bakery resume ancient château operation important image private burgundy lover iron event battle told scientist state twitter cover region jackson step flight city russia nature corps building official house southeastern trade israel back outrage backwards rudolf woman accusation shirt aviation neighbor hug october unprecedented africa recent depiction appearance accuse identify profit government promise religion extension african combat different manipulate include turkey idea empire film fire congress prime middle code baussan food minister site briefing left france alix sandro artifact biden concerned wartime held present layer lazaro previously destroyed understand skip kill funding strip wound young school civil washington peruvian addition oath heaven,-0.9778,0.3351274499847669,10.057839335180056,0.381303264636598,0,2023-12-05
NPR,"A Palestinian doctor pushes for peace, but suffers a devastating blow from war",2023-12-05 05:03:00,Greg Myre,"Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish initially gained prominence in the 1990s as the first Palestinian doctor appointed to work in an Israeli hospital, paving the way for many others that followed. ""If you go to any hospital, you will see Palestinian doctors, Israeli doctors, nurses, patients. All of them are equal inside the hospital,"" he said. I first met Abuelaish in 2001 in southern Israel, in the the desert town of Beersheba, where he straddled two worlds. During the week, he worked and lived at Soroka Hospital, where he specialized in fertility medicine. On weekends, he drove a short distance home to the Gaza Strip to be with his wife and eight children in the Jabalia refugee camp. His aim, then and now, is the same. ""I want equality between Palestinians and Israelis, not someone superior to the other,"" he said. ""No one will accept the others being superior to them."" Yet none of his efforts spared him or his family from terrible tragedies in the Israeli-Palestinian fighting. He was pushing for peace in the 1990s as the Israelis and Palestinians tried — but ultimately failed — to reach a deal ending generations of conflict. In the heavy fighting that followed in the early 2000s, an Israeli clampdown on Gaza eventually made it too difficult for Abuelaish to enter Israel to work. Then came a terrible loss in 2008 when his wife died of leukemia. The following year, he suffered another devastating blow that played out live on Israeli television. During an intense bout of Israel-Hamas fighting in 2009, Israel's Channel 10 television station called him regularly for an update from Gaza, which he delivered in his fluent Hebrew. One evening he was about to go on air when an Israeli tank shell slammed into his home. Three of his daughters, ages 14, 15 and 21, were killed, as was one of his nieces. The doctor wailed in grief as he spoke to the Israeli television anchor. ""My God, My God, what have we done?"" he cried. ""I wanted to try to save them, but they died of head wounds immediately."" Abuelaish spoke to NPR later that year. ""I lost three precious, beautiful daughters, but I can't return them back,"" he said. ""I have five more [children], and I have the future. I have many good things that I can do for others."" He wrote a book entitled, I Shall Not Hate: A Gaza Doctor's Journey on the Road to Peace and Human Dignity. He left Gaza with his surviving children. Today he's a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, where I reached him for this interview. Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish prays in 2021 at the graves of his three daughters and a niece who were killed by an Israeli tank shell at his home in northern Gaza in the 2009 fighting between Israel and Hamas. Khalil Hamra/AP hide caption Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish prays in 2021 at the graves of his three daughters and a niece who were killed by an Israeli tank shell at his home in northern Gaza in the 2009 fighting between Israel and Hamas. Abuelaish has remained in close contact with relatives and friends in Gaza, and visited this summer, before the current fighting. But now tragedy has struck again. He said that on Nov. 7, an Israeli airstrike hit the home where his relatives were sheltering in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing 22 members of his extended family, including cousins, nephews and nieces. ""I just saw them in August. I was there and now they are gone,"" he said. ""One niece is a medical doctor and she is 25 years old. She was supposed to start her residency soon."" Every day seems to bring a new jolt of pain — like the recent fighting around Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Israel said its military took over the hospital because Hamas operated from a network of tunnels network below the medical compound. Abuelaish first went to the hospital at age 9, spending nearly a week there as he was treated for rheumatic fever. Later, as a young doctor, he worked at Al-Shifa. Hospitals have traditionally been one of the few places in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where both sides check their hostilities at the door. Abuelaish recalled the newborns in Israeli hospital nurseries where he worked. ""They are in their beds close to each other. You can't recognize who is your daughter or who is your son,"" he said. ""Once they step outside the borders of the hospital, they become different and they are treated differently. Why? That's the problem. It's man-made."" Abuelaish remains in touch with Israelis he's befriended. But with emotions running so high during the war, he acknowledges they don't see eye to eye. ""I want them to see the pain of the Palestinians as equal to the Israelis,"" he said. ""Every baby is a precious. Every human life is a precious. And that's when we start to see the other side."" He sees this war, like the ones that preceded it, as sheer folly, predicting nothing will be resolved. ""I hope the war will end. But I hope no one will celebrate victory, because all are losers,"" he said. Greg Myre is an NPR national security correspondent who was based in Jerusalem from 2000-2007.

NPR,"After Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, fears of a wider Middle East conflict grow",2023-12-05 05:00:00,Joe Hernandez,"Houthi supporters chant slogans and hold signs reading ""Death to America, Death to Israel,"" as they attend a rally on March 26, 2023, in Sanaa, Yemen. Since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out in Gaza in October, some have been warning that the localized fighting could erupt into a regional conflict. Those warnings came when Hezbollah vollied rockets into Israel from across the border in Lebanon and as the U.S. sent two aircraft carriers and supporting ships to the region. And they came again on Sunday when Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked commercial vessels in the Red Sea in an incident that also involved a U.S. warship on patrol in the area. U.S. Central Command said the Houthis attacked three ships over several hours using ballistic missiles and drones, several of which American forces shot down. CENTCOM said it had ""every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran. The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international allies and partners."" Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree took responsibility for attacking two of the ships, saying the group was blocking Israeli ships from passing through the Red Sea until Israel halted its military operations in Gaza. In addition to the attacks by Hezbollah and the Houthis, other militant groups backed by Iran have carried out dozens of attacks against U.S. military forces spread throughout the Middle East in recent weeks, according to the Pentagon. While these attacks have been frequent, they've so far been on a relatively small scale and the U.S. has responded with limited airstrikes. Yet they point to the volatility in the region and the possibility that attacks could escalate into a much larger battle. The Houthis emerged as a rebel group in the late 1980s and '90s, but grew in military might after the turn of the century and went to war with the Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis overthrew the country's government and gained control of the capital, Sanaa, which the militia still controls today. Houthis follow a branch of Shia Islam, as does the Iranian leadership, which helped lead to their alliance. In 2015, a coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia launched a military intervention in Yemen on behalf of the internationally recognized government in an attempt to beat back the Houthis. Saudi Arabia is a top rival of Iran, which supports the Houthis with weapons, intelligence and other political and diplomatic aid. That conflict has been raging for years and spawned the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, according to the United Nations, with more than 24 million people in need of aid and protection. Still, the Houthis managed to withstand the offensive and remain in control of large swaths of territory and much of the Yemeni population. Thomas Juneau, a University of Ottawa professor who studies the Middle East, said the Houthis have been emboldened by their ability to resist the Saudi-led attacks, and as a result they've been trying to grow from a domestic power into a regional player in recent years. Loading... ""We've seen them attack the [United Arab Emirates, which had allied with Saudi Arabia in the war]. We've seen them attack Saudi Arabia. We have seen them, in the past, attack shipping in the southern half of the Red Sea,"" he said. ""So when the Gaza war started in early October, to me it was a matter of time before the Houthis would become involved militarily."" The attacks likely would also be viewed as messages of support to Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah and may be popular at home too, according to Juneau, where there are strong pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli attitudes. ""To be seen domestically as not only opposing Israel politically but actually trying to do something about it — i.e. sending missiles and drones — is a classic way to mobilize domestic support by playing on these pro-Palestinian popular feelings,"" he said. This is not the first time the Houthis have targeted ships — including U.S. naval vessels — in the Red Sea off the country's western coast. In 2016, missiles were fired from coastal Yemen toward a U.S. Navy destroyer twice in four days. The U.S. responded by firing missiles at three radar installations in Houthi territory. Juneau said the Houthis didn't target American vessels again for several years, but it's unclear if a similar U.S. response today would have the same deterrent effect. ""It will be much more difficult to do that today than in 2016, because the Houthis are far more powerful now than they were before and they feel much more emboldened,"" he said. The Houthis have also fired missiles directly at Israel before, but in one such attack last month Israel's military stopped it with its air defenses. Going after commercial ships also gives the Houthis leverage, Juneau added, to negotiate with impacted nations and raise the ambitious militia group's international profile. Last month, Japan announced it was approaching the group for talks after a Japanese-operated cargo ship was hijacked in the Red Sea. ""That's exactly what the Houthis want,"" Juneau said. ""By forcing the Japanese government — which is a very important G7 country and so on — to deal with them directly, they are looking for recognition, at least de facto, of their status as the governing authority inside Yemen.""",5402,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1217056536/houthis-explainer-red-sea-yemen-saudi-middle-east-israel-gaza,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,leverage deal reason halt spawn hour coalition central march ship home slogan time vessel group saudi airstrikes command domestically intervention hamas nation negotiate profile allied yemen protection view arab raise coordination oppose installation fight cargo load drone broke houthi popular brig japanese ally ottawa shipping militarily internationally commercial accord country force intelligence facto ambitious month sanaa announce coastal reading volatility area withstand weapon political leadership powerful today approach full shia feeling send warship emerge aid beat military resist target professor carrier overthrew past militia stop impact warn conflict rival southern turn give control alliance ballistic recognize erupt swath classic saree talk small govern follow scale world pentagon matter day limited missile capital result study fully point yahya chant attempt destroyer large half militant ability diplomatic involve rally grow yemeni branch feel spread top dozen century supporter response status radar authority similar player attack respond unclear iranian thomas united directly start lebanon million late believe border emirate gaza appropriate arabia international rag operation difficult important islam consider possibility battle humanitarian year state inside relatively centcom effect population region iran politically america offensive embolden israel back hold carry east support october incident mobilize crisis recent shot passing territory air government rebel early behalf block houthis include strong escalate manage fire naval death american middle remain hijack juneau responsibility lead navy recognition regional patrol hezbollah japan domestic warning message frequent launch power western spokesman aircraft deterrent defense sunday red sign israeli partner rocket add addition localize play coast attitude attend week university vollied enable,-0.9649,0.0555349870418363,9.275314960629924,0.2933581349206348,0,2023-12-05
NPR,"The U.S. supports China's growth if it 'plays by the rules,' commerce secretary says",2023-12-05 05:00:00,Mary Louise Kelly,", Kathryn Fox President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together after meeting in November. Brendan Smialowski /AFP via Getty Images hide caption President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together after meeting in November. Last month, China's President Xi Jinping sat down with President Joe Biden for the first time in more than a year. The pair had plenty to discuss, but one of Xi's most notable quotes was when he told Biden: ""Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed, and one country's success is an opportunity for the other."" U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo says that the reality is a bit more complicated than that. She sat down with All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly to explain what her plan is for coexisting with another world superpower — and the growing role of commerce in U.S. national security. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images hide caption U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Mary Louise Kelly: There's a recent survey — this is from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs — that found nearly 60% of Americans consider China's development as a world power to be a critical threat. So, secretary, what do you think? How do you see it?Gina Raimondo: I think that a growing China, which plays by the rules, is a good thing for China, a good thing for America and a good thing for the world. And President Biden is clearer on this than anyone. We want the Chinese people to have prosperity, and a good economy. That being said, our job, number one, is to protect the American people, the American economy and, of course, our national security. So if China plays by the rules, trade could be a good thing. Kelly: You just said twice, if China plays by the rules. I mean, the devil is in the details. Raimondo: Exactly. If they overly subsidize their companies, if they rely on forced labor, if they don't follow good labor practices and environmental rules, if they try to — which they do — steal our technology to advance their military, those are all bad things. And we have to do everything we can to prevent it. Kelly: So let me ask about one piece of this, which you were leading. This is the implementation of the CHIPS Act, which funds U.S. manufacturing, American companies to try to offset the threat from China. You have said there can be no negotiation when it comes to matters of national security. And I believe you were speaking particularly about semiconductor chips used to manufacture weapons. You've said, ""I have to use every tool in my toolbox to make sure those chips do not find their way into the hands of the Chinese military."" What are the tools in your toolbox? Listen to All Things Considered each day here or on your local member station for more interviews like this. Raimondo: Well, we have an offensive strategy and a defensive strategy. On offense, we have the CHIPS Act, which is a $52 billion investment in American semiconductor manufacturing, which is, in my judgment, the most important thing we can do, run faster than China, innovate more than China, keep our lead on semiconductors and artificial intelligence. So if I do my job right, a decade from now, there'll be 10 or more new leading edge semiconductor manufacturing companies in America, employing American workers and engineers. At the same time, the other tools I have in the toolbox are to deny China our most sophisticated technology. So we have tools at commerce which allow me to say: U.S. companies cannot sell certain semiconductor chips, certain semiconductor equipment, certain artificial intelligence technology to China. Because truthfully, why would we? They're going to use it to advance their military against us. I see it as pretty matter of fact, crystal clear and no room for negotiation. This little chip will have a large role in the future of world commerce. Wong Yu Ling/Getty Images hide caption This little chip will have a large role in the future of world commerce. Kelly: When you say that, when you use those words — there will be no negotiation when it comes to matters of national security — what kind of response do you get? You were at the table last month for that Xi-Biden summit. Raimondo: Again, there's not much that you can say to that, if we are clear and strong, and they wouldn't either. I mean, they're well within their sovereign rights to build up their military capacity. And we are well within our rights to do everything we can to obstruct that development. We're going to do business where we can, where it's in our interest. We're going to communicate, so we deescalate and not escalate. The world can't handle greater conflict between the U.S. and China. We're going to manage the conflict, and that means communication. But, you know, we're going to be tough because we have to be. Kelly: Another item in your portfolio is AI, artificial intelligence, and how to implement the president's new executive order on the safety and security of AI, how to engage the private sector. When I have interviewed private sector leaders, CEOs at tech companies, they pretty much with unanimity say, ""Look, we want rules, we want some guidance regulating. We are not sure how to do this."" Are you? Raimondo: We're learning. It would not be honest for me to say we know everything, because it's new and evolving much faster than anybody realized. Kelly: What tools — speaking of tools in your toolbox — do you have to enforce whatever you come to believe is the right path forward for AI? Raimondo: So right now, we're doing the policy work to figure out how to enable innovation, but also be safe and trustworthy and controlled. Ultimately, Congress will have to act to put, really, teeth into the regulations and have any kind of true enforcement mechanisms. Kelly: So we have to have legislation? Raimondo: I think so. You know, if you want to talk about a fine or any kind of penalties that have teeth in them. I mean, the administration has some regulatory capacity. And we are doing a lot at the Commerce Department which is working, we've gotten pledges from all the big companies, a lot of VCs. It is working. But ultimately, Congress has to take action. By the way, I think they will. I mean, I know Senator [Chuck] Schumer is doing a great job on this, convening people. We've briefed his senators. They're doing a great job in Congress. But at the end of the day, that's what we need.",6509,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1217040572/the-u-s-supports-chinas-growth-if-it-plays-by-the-rules-commerce-secretary-says,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/12/04/gettyimages-1784317745-14042fd92f0f835cd279f63a928549633d605e17-s1100-c50.jpg,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,mechanism faster chuck national interviewed piece teeth explain found worker communication time notable communicate kelly act coexist complicate employ tough yu tool guidance superpower mary sovereign security defensive honest item enforcement prosperity reality devil fund particularly global hide tasos big sell clarity chinese action engineer build run china lot development vcs regulation summit country force regulate intelligence month edit ceo ultimately quote weapon strategy penalty order deny truthfully executive enforce artificial military getty role negotiation semiconductor convene conflict louise affair control plan raimondo number evolve company talk follow implementation offset trustworthy implement world environmental chip matter day word business rule pledge future sophisticated department gina large economy planet rely billion safe leader labor make grow practice clear capacity sat job forward pair policy opportunity subsidize equipment technology toolbox response path safety clearer decade judgment lightly smialowski length course meeting administration fact kathryn briefed schumer discus advance believe brendan regulatory success find council important image investment consider private room walk offense sector told year station hand engage interest secretary america succeed table offensive fox kind trade detail pretty local fine recent listen prevent great deescalate strong interview escalate manage congress bit american earth plenty steal realize manufacture lead joe chicago biden member protect manufacturing learn figure power obstruct jinping handle overly threat legislation crystal survey tech caption innovate november edge senator commerce put xi critical speak work unanimity portfolio play host president innovation enable,0.99575,0.1843601167614072,6.37069662921348,0.4638132363860519,0,2023-12-05

Issues related to oil price caps under OPEC+ will also be on the agenda, he added.Putin's trip was first announced on Monday by his foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov, who didn't give a date for the visits when he spoke to the Russian news outlet Life.“I hope that these will be very useful negotiations, which we consider extremely important,” Ushakov was quoted as saying by Life.Putin will make the visit at a time when Russia wants to advance its role as a power broker in the conflict in the Middle East.Putin will host Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in the Kremlin on Thursday, Peskov added.The Russian president visited China in October and recently made several trips to former Soviet nations.The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.Since the warrant was issued, Putin chose not to attend a BRICS summit in South Africa because the country would be obliged to arrest Putin upon arrival as it is a signatory to the international court’s treaty.Neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE have signed the ICC’s founding treaty.",1608,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-discuss-israel-hamas-war-1-day-trip-105380514,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2268ed89-dc68-40ab-b2f5-7dae5c8d45e7/wirestory_7f279a60352b1826cf52a5b0e1e2d610_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,chose summit russian related october oblige spoke country signatory treaty week date announce focus saudi advance arabia former criminal give time ushakov extremely make quote soviet consider talk raisi international emirate hamas sign thursday putin role russia price president issue arab spokesman negotiation personal united hope bilateral icc warrant accuse agenda arrest south trip conflict affair china march arrival peskov wednesday court visit dmitry outlet moscow child recently uae work found crime cap kremlin abduction news ebrahim vladimir relation israel yuri important oil host adviser responsibility middle broker monday iranian africa power attend foreign brics,-0.9015,0.0,11.998727915194344,0.1634920634920635,0,2023-12-05
ABC,UK Home Secretary James Cleverly visits Rwanda to try to unblock controversial asylum plan,2023-12-05 04:07:00,The Associated Press,"KIGALI, Rwanda -- British Home Secretary James Cleverly flew to Rwanda on Tuesday in a bid to revive a plan to send asylum-seekers to the East African country that has been blocked by U.K. courts.The U.K. government said Cleverly will meet his Rwandan counterpart, Vincent Biruta, to sign a new treaty and discuss next steps for the troubled “migration and economic development partnership.”“Rwanda cares deeply about the rights of refugees, and I look forward to meeting with counterparts to sign this agreement and further discuss how we work together to tackle the global challenge of illegal migration,” Cleverly said.The Rwanda plan is central to the Conservative government’s self-imposed goal of stopping unauthorized asylum-seekers arriving on small boats across the English Channel.Britain and Rwanda struck a deal in April 2022 for some migrants who cross the Channel to be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be processed and, if successful, they would stay. The U.K. government argues that the deportations will discourage others from making the risky sea crossing and break the business model of people-smuggling gangs.Critics say it is both unethical and unworkable to send migrants to a country 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) away, with no chance of ever settling in the U.K.Britain has already paid Rwanda at least 140 million pounds ($177 million) under the agreement, but no one has yet been sent there amid legal challenges.Last month the U.K. Supreme Court ruled the plan was illegal because Rwanda is not a safe country for refugees. Britain’s top court said asylum-seekers faced “a real risk of ill-treatment” and could be returned by Rwanda to the home countries they had fled.For years, human rights groups have accused Rwanda’s government of cracking down on perceived dissent and keeping tight control on many aspects of life, from jailing critics to keeping homeless people off the streets of Kigali. The government denies it.The U.K. government responded by saying it would strike a new treaty with Rwanda to address the court’s concerns — including a block on Rwanda sending migrants home — and then pass a law declaring Rwanda a safe destination.___",2191,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uk-home-secretary-james-cleverly-visits-rwanda-unblock-105380154,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/390bce89-fac5-4a12-9906-5179ffbcb3cb/wirestory_aa0f252b87b77dcd724b634840f4e83b_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,tackle model kilometer kigali revive amid country migrant goal plan east treaty discus law deal counterpart james central rule crack arrive deeply make jailing migration business perceive concern control african discourage asylum street home secretary sign global chance meet risky break top legal real agreement april respond step address unworkable economic argues paid tuesday homeless small flew million settle month refugee mile british accuse denies stay boat rwanda channel troubled return human cleverly successful cross biruta rwandan away claim challenge critic group stop year court deportation english unethical work declare bid process risk illegal include government life vincent aspect development struck safe forward pound block unauthorized dissent strike conservative send meeting britain supreme tight,-0.86555,0.4107713372889092,12.02483116883117,0.3894564694564695,0,2023-12-05
ABC,French lawmakers approve bill to ban disposable e-cigarettes to protect youth,2023-12-05 03:58:00,The Associated Press,"PARIS -- France's National Assembly unanimously approved a bill to ban single-use, disposable electronic cigarettes, in an attempt to protect young people drawn to their flavors and mitigate the environmental impacts of the disposable products known as “puffs.”Lawmakers adopted the bill in a late-night vote on Monday by 104 in favor, zero against.The bill, supported by the government, will then move to the Senate where it is expected to be adopted as well. It could go into effect by September 2024.Disposable e-cigarettes — which cost about 10 euros (nearly $11) each — are small, battery-powered devices that are especially popular among teenagers for their sweet flavors.

Their small, non-rechargeable lithium batteries often end up in landfills.This bill is part of a broader trend. The UK, Ireland, and Germany are considering similar measures.

ABC,"2 boats adrift in the Andaman Sea with 400 Rohingya aboard desperately need rescue, UN says",2023-12-05 03:03:00,GRANT PECK Associated Press,"BANGKOK -- An estimated 400 Rohingya Muslims believed to be aboard two boats adrift in the Andaman Sea without adequate supplies could die if more is not done to rescue them, according to the U.N. refugee agency and aid workers.The number of Rohingya Muslims fleeing by boats in a seasonal exodus — usually from squalid, overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh — has been rising since last year due to cuts to food rations and a spike in gang violence.“There are about 400 children, women and men looking death in the eye if there are no moves to save these desperate souls,” Babar Baloch, the agency’s Bangkok-based regional spokesperson, told The Associated Press.The whereabouts of the other boat were unclear.The boats apparently embarked from Bangladesh and are reported to have been at sea for about two weeks, he said.The captain of one of the boats, contacted by the AP, said he had 180 to 190 people on board. They were out of food and water and the engine was damaged. The captain, who gave his name as Maan Nokim, said he feared all on board will die if they do not receive help.On Sunday, Nokim said the boat was 320 kilometers (200 miles) from Thailand's west coast. A Thai navy spokesperson, contacted Monday, said he had no information about the boats.The location is about the same distance from Indonesia’s northernmost province of Aceh, where another boat with 139 people landed Saturday on Sabang Island, off the tip of Sumatra, Baloch said. Those on the ship included 58 children, 45 women and 36 men — the typical balance of those making the sea journey, he said. Hundreds more arrived in Aceh last month.About 740,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to the camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, after a brutal counterinsurgency campaign tore through their communities. Myanmar security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and the burning of thousands of Rohingya homes, and international courts are considering whether their actions constituted genocide.Most of the refugees leaving the camps by sea attempt to reach Muslim-dominated Malaysia, hoping to find work there. Thailand turns them away or detains them. Indonesia, another Muslim-dominated country where many end up, also puts them in detention.Baloch said if the two boats adrift are not given assistance, the world “may witness another tragedy such as in December 2022, when a boat with 180 aboard went missing in one of the darkest such incidents in the region.”The aid group Save the Children said in a Nov. 22 report that 465 Rohingya children had arrived in Indonesia by boat over the previous week and the the number of refugees taking to the seas had increased by more than 80%.It said more than 3,570 Rohingya Muslims had left Bangladesh and Myanmar this year, up from nearly 2,000 in the same period of 2022. Of those who left this year, 225 are known to have died or were missing, with many others not accounted for.“The desperate situation of Rohingya families is forcing them to take unacceptable risks in search of a better life.

The plan is to allow air traffic to resume from midday,” the airport said on its website. “However, it can be assumed that the majority of flights will also have to be canceled during the rest of the day for safety reasons.”Tuesday's cancellations came after all flights at Munich Airport were grounded on Saturday following heavy snowfall in the city and in Germany's southern state of Bavaria.Road traffic and train connections were also hampered by the weather conditions.Two people died in a collision between a car and a tractor-trailer on the A8 highway in Upper Bavaria. According to the police, their car skidded under the rear of a truck, which had come to a stop across the highway overnight from Monday to Tuesday due to frozen rain on the highway's surface, German news agency dpa reported.The A99 near Munich was shutdown in both direction after 13 vehicles were involved in a mass accident, dpa reported. There was no immediate information about possible injuries.Train operator Deutsche Bahn said traffic in the Munich region would be affected for several days.“At present, access to Munich's main station is severely restricted. Only a few long-distance trains are therefore running to and from Munich,” it said on its website on Tuesday.Rail services to the Austrian cities of Salzburg and Innsbruck, as well as Zurich in Switzerland, remained suspended. Deutsche Bahn said that there could also be train cancellations and delays in other parts of southern Germany.

ABC,Israel strikes in and around Gaza's second-largest city in an already bloody new phase of the war,2023-12-05 02:52:00,NAJIB JOBAIN Associated Press and SAMY MAGDY Associated Press,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip -- Israel intensified its bombardment in and around Gaza's second-largest city early Tuesday, as ambulances and private cars came racing into a local hospital carrying people wounded in a bloody new phase of the war in Gaza.Under U.S. pressure to prevent further mass casualties, Israel says it is being more precise as it widens its offensive into southern Gaza after obliterating much of the north. Aerial bombardment and the ground offensive have already driven three-fourths of the territory's 2.3 million people from their homes.At the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, ambulances brought dozens of wounded people in throughout the night. At one point, a car pulled up and man emerged carrying a young boy in a bloody shirt, whose hand had been blown off.“What’s happening here is imaginable,” said Hamza al-Bursh, who lives in the neighborhood of Maan, one of several in and around the city where Israel has ordered civilians to leave. “They strike indiscriminately.”Residents said troops had advanced following heavy airstrikes to Bani Suheila, a town just outside Khan Younis. Halima Abdel-Rahman, who fled to the town earlier in the war from her home in Beit Lahiya in the north, said they could hear explosions through the night.“They are very close,” she said. “It’s the same scenario we saw in the north.”Satellite photos from Sunday showed around 150 Israeli tanks, armored personnel carriers and other vehicles just under 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the heart of Khan Younis. The army did not respond to a request for comment and rarely publicizes troop deployments.Israel ordered the full-scale evacuation of northern Gaza in the early days of the war and has barred people who left from returning. In the south, it has ordered people out of nearly two dozen neighborhoods in and around Khan Younis. That further reduced the area where civilians can seek refuge in central and southern Gaza by more than a quarter.Palestinians say that as Israel continues to strike across the besieged territory, there are no areas where they feel safe, and many fear that if they leave their homes they will never be allowed to return.Israel says it must dismantle Hamas' extensive military infrastructure and remove it from power in order to prevent a repeat of the Oct. 7 attack that ignited the war. The surprise assault through the border fence saw Hamas and other Palestinian militants kill about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capture some 240 men, women and children.The military says it makes every effort to spare civilians and accuses Hamas of using them as human shields as the militants fight in dense residential areas, where they have a labyrinths of tunnels, bunkers, rocket launchers and sniper nests.Hamas is deeply rooted in Palestinian society, and its determination to end decades of open-ended Israeli military rule is shared by most Palestinians, even those opposed to its ideology and its attacks on Israeli civilians. That will complicate any effort to eliminate Hamas without causing massive casualties and further displacement.Even after weeks of unrelenting bombardment, Hamas' top leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, was able to conduct complex cease-fire negotiations and orchestrate the release of more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners last week. Palestinian militants have also kept up their rocket fire into Israel, both before and after the truce.The fighting has meanwhile brought unprecedented death and destruction to the coastal strip.The Health Ministry in Gaza said the death toll in the territory since Oct. 7 has surpassed 15,890 people – 70% of them women and children — with more than 42,000 wounded. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. It says hundreds have been killed or wounded since the cease-fire’s end, and many still are trapped under rubble.An Israeli army official provided a similar figure for the death toll in Gaza on Monday, after weeks in which Israeli officials had cast doubt on the ministry's count. The official said at least 15,000 people have been killed, including 5,000 militants, without saying how the military arrived at its figures. The military says 84 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza offensive.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday that it was too soon to pass judgment on Israeli operations, but that it was unusual for a modern military to identify precise areas of expected ground maneuvers and ask people to move out, as Israel has done in Khan Younis.“These are the kinds of steps that we have asked them to undertake.” he said. “These are the conversations we’re having day in, day out.”Airstrikes and the ground offensive in northern Gaza have reduced large swaths of Gaza City and nearby areas to a rubble-filled wasteland. Hundreds of thousands of residents fled south during the assault.Leaflets dropped by the Israeli military over Khan Younis in recent days warn people to head further south toward the border with Egypt, but they are unable to leave Gaza, as both Israel and neighboring Egypt have refused to accept any refugees.The area that Israel ordered evacuated was home to some 117,000 people, and now it also houses more than 50,000 people displaced from the north, living in 21 shelters, the U.N. said. It was not known how many were fleeing.Adding to the chaos, phone and internet networks across Gaza collapsed again Monday evening, the Palestinian telecom provider PalTel said. It was the latest of several outages that have complicated rescue efforts. Communications were restored early Tuesday.___Magdy reported from Cairo.

ABC,Live updates | Israel pushes deeper south after calling for evacuations in southern Gaza,2023-12-05 02:00:00,The Associated Press,"Israel's military pushed deeper south Tuesday in Gaza after it called for more evacuations in the southern portion of the enclave in its pursuit to wipe out the territory's Hamas rulers. The war has already killed more than 15,000 Palestinians and displaced over three-fourths of Gaza's 2.3 million residents, who are running out of safe places to go.The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said the death toll in the territory since Oct. 7 has surpassed 15,890, with more than 41,000 wounded. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but said 70% of the dead were women and children. Israel says it targets Hamas operatives and blames civilian casualties on the militants, accusing them of operating in residential neighborhoods.The United States, Qatar and Egypt, which mediated the earlier cease-fire, say they are working on a longer truce. But hopes for another temporary truce faded after Israel called its negotiators home over the weekend. Hamas said talks on releasing more of the scores of hostages seized by militants on Oct. 7 must be tied to a permanent cease-fire.Currently:— Israel orders evacuations as it widens its offensive, but Palestinians are running out of places to go.— Pennsylvania's governor rebukes Philadelphia protesters for chanting outside an Israeli restaurant.— A global journalist group says the Israel-Hamas conflict is a war beyond compare for media deaths.— The kibbutz of Nir Oz can illuminate Hamas’ hostage strategy, an operation that was unprecedented both in scope and execution.— Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.Here’s what’s happening in the war:ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s state-run news agency says Turkish intelligence officials have warned their Israeli counterparts of “serious consequences” if they attempt to target members of Hamas on Turkish soil.The warning, reported by the Anadolu Agency late Monday, came after Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s domestic security agency Shin Bet, said in an audio recording that his organization is prepared to destroy Hamas “in every place,” including in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar.Anadolu Agency, quoting unnamed Turkish intelligence officials, said “necessary warnings were made” to Israeli officials who were told their actions would “have serious consequences.” The agency also quoted the officials as saying that Turkey had prevented “illegal activities” by foreign operatives in the past and that no foreign intelligence agency would be allowed to carry out operations on Turkish territory. Israel’s Mossad spy agency has been accused of involvement in a series of assassinations overseas of Palestinian militants and Iranian nuclear scientists over the years.Turkey has hosted Hamas officials and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said his government considers Hamas to be a liberation organization, not a terrorist group.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Satellite photos analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press show that the Israeli military has begun its ground offensive in the southern reaches of the Gaza Strip as part of its war against Hamas.Since the collapse of a temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that saw militant-held hostages swapped for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, the Israeli military has launched an intense campaign of airstrikes and ground fighting in the southern Gaza Strip as well. The satellite photos released by Planet Labs PBC provide the first clear look at the intensity and scope at which the Israelis are fighting.The images, shot Sunday by Planet, show Israeli tanks and armored personnel carriers just under 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the heart of Khan Younis, the major city of the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Many who fled the Israeli offensive and airstrike campaign in Gaza City's north now live around Khan Younis and other nearby areas after the Israeli military ordered them to evacuate.The Israeli deployment sits just to the west of Salah al-Din, a main north-south corridor within the Gaza Strip that many used to flee. An AP analysis found positions in four clusters, with a total of around 150 armored personnel carriers, tanks and other vehicles in the area. Israeli soldiers have created packed dirt berms around some of their positions, which can be used for cover.Fresh tank tracks could be seen chewed through the ground there, suggesting the movements were recent.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding their strategy for the offensive and what the satellite photos showed. However, the maneuver and the number of vehicles there suggests that the Israeli military is preparing to potentially move south in Khan Younis. Fighting already has been reported in the area.___Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed.TEL AVIV, Israel — The families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza say they are set to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after demanding a sit-down with him.The families have sought to meet with Netanyahu and his wartime Cabinet since a truce deal between Israel and Hamas that saw the release of 105 hostages expired Nov. 30. Since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, many families have complained that they were not adequately kept informed of the efforts to secure their loved ones’ release.

Reuters,Fourth Republican presidential debate: where is it and who'll be there?,2023-12-05 01:32:00,Gram Slattery,"WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Four Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to face off in the fourth debate of their party's 2024 nominating contest this Wednesday.Here are some facts about the debate:It will take place at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa at 7 p.m. local time (0100 GMT). It will be hosted by subscription-based television network NewsNation, conservative political journal the Washington Free Beacon, The Megyn Kelly Show on Sirius XM and Rumble, a video hosting service popular with conservatives.The forum, which will be broadcast on television news channel NewsNation and streamed on Rumble, represents something of an experiment by the Republican National Committee after the first three debates were hosted by major news networks Fox and NBC.Alabama is a deeply Republican state, which will not be competitive in the 2024 general election. It does, however, host a relatively early primary contest, set for March 5.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley- who are battling for second place in the primary race- tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will be on stage, according to the Republican National Committee.Former President Donald Trump will notably not be there, which limits the debate's significance given that he leads the field by more than 40 percentage points, most polls show. Trump has skipped all of the previous debates, saying the party should shift its attention to the general election.Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who qualified for the third debate, has dropped out.Unlike the previous debates, Trump has no plans to counter-program by holding his own public event, and instead will host a private fundraiser.Ultimately, any candidate will need to chip away at Trump's massive lead if they want a shot at the nomination, and he will not be present. The Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the primary campaign, are set for Jan. 15.DeSantis leads Haley in most national surveys, but Haley is well ahead of DeSantis in the early nominating states of New Hampshire and South Carolina. She has been rising in opinion polls for months, while DeSantis has stalled out.If either candidate has a particularly strong performance, that could help him or her break that stalemate and begin to consolidate the support of Republicans looking to move beyond Trump. Still, the importance of debates has historically varied, and even a standout showing is not guaranteed to reshape the race for runner-up.",2548,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/where-is-fourth-republican-debate-who-will-be-there-2023-11-28/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/IX2R7DYJTVK3BFQ3OIPQ4I5RTI.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,nikki survey private present governor tech plan opinion popular xm schedule former political time jersey give beacon deeply tim drop battling public historically poll megyn gmt ron standout shift previous chris particularly nation importance performance ahead strong stage forum chip experiment break fourth competitive sirius president qualify free percentage washington nominate local nomination service kelly reshape skip united tuscaloosa massive donald point general guaranteed represent stall republican support month election rise consolidate set event dec ambassador channel south accord place journal major debate rumble national march desantis haley party entrepreneur christie away hampshire stalemate video stream limit begin broadcast campaign presidential vivek attention caucus television fox early network trump university race committee hold field newsnation state instead move carolina lead ramaswamy alabama iowa news relatively candidate contest show significance shot fact conservative host primary varied scott notably reuters,0.95805,0.1177394034536891,11.912662192393732,0.3681168831168831,0,2023-12-05
NPR,"A U.S. woman from Boston was killed in a shark attack in the Bahamas, police say",2023-12-05 01:16:00,The Associated Press,"""We extend our heartfelt condolences...for this most unfortunate situation,"" she said. Police said a lifeguard rescued both people with a boat upon seeing what was happening, but the woman suffered serious injuries to the right side of her body and was declared dead at the scene despite CPR efforts. It was not immediately clear what type of shark attacked the woman. A police superintendent did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment. Gavin Naylor, program director of the International Shark Attack File in Florida, said in an interview that there have been a couple of shark-related fatalities reported in the Bahamas in the past five years. He noted that the Bahamas has a ""huge"" tourist population, adding that there are a lot of people in the water and a lot of visitors who want to view sharks from a fishing boat or dive with them. ""So the sharks get acclimated, and the animals are a little bit less cautious than they otherwise might be,"" he said. Between 30 to 40 shark species live around the Bahamas, although the Caribbean reef shark, the bull shark, the tiger shark and the black tip shark have the highest bite frequency, Naylor said. ""Usually, it's an accidental bite. They think it's something else,"" he said. ""Once in a while, they'll actually single out people, and it's very intentional."" Fatal shark attacks are rare, with only an average of five to six reported worldwide a year, most of them occurring in Australia, Naylor said. Last year, there were a total of 57 unprovoked bites around the globe, the majority of them in the U.S., according to the International Shark Attack File. At least 33 confirmed unprovoked shark attacks have been reported in the Bahamas since 1580, with the island ranking ninth worldwide, according to the file. The Nassau Guardian newspaper reported that authorities in the Bahamas are still searching for a German woman who went missing late last month after she was apparently attacked while diving. Last year, a shark killed a U.S. cruise ship passenger from Pennsylvania who was snorkeling in the northern Bahamas near Green Cay. Most shark attacks in the Caribbean occur in the Bahamas, although a rare shark attack was reported in the French Caribbean territory of St. Martin three years ago.",2270,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1217229914/woman-boston-killed-shark-attack-bahamas,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,green visitor report globe bite huge type clear couple dive bit occur cpr florida fishing tip tourist newspaper confirm specie despite pennsylvania unprovoked late international ninth interview woman side lifeguard rank cruise view island comment live worldwide extend guardian northern black respond injury apparently majority frequency fatal ago message nassau martin single snorkel add condolence naylor month intentional immediately request fatality reef effort gavin boat file accord superintendent past bahamas search police caribbean authority water year high miss territory attack situation accidental declare director kill french australia bull shark body rare cautious program total note cay acclimate average passenger suffer german lot animal heartfelt population rescue unfortunate dead scene ship happen tiger,-0.9803,0.13215859030837,8.433909090909086,0.425,0,2023-12-05
ABC,Prince Harry challenges UK government's decision to strip him of security detail when he moved to US,2023-12-05 01:07:00,BRIAN MELLEY Associated Press,"LONDON -- LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry is challenging on Tuesday the British government’s decision to strip him of his security detail after he gave up his status as a working member of the royal family and moved to the United States.The Duke of Sussex said he wants protection when he visits home and claimed it's partly because an aggressive press jeopardizes his safety and that of his family.The three-day hearing scheduled to begin in London’s High Court is the latest in a string of Harry's legal cases that have kept London judges busy as he takes on the U.K. government and the British tabloid media. It was not clear if he would attend Tuesday's hearing.Harry failed to persuade a different judge earlier this year that he should be able to privately pay for London’s police force to guard him when he comes to town. A judge denied that offer after a government lawyer argued that officers shouldn't be used as “private bodyguards for the wealthy.”Harry, the youngest son of King Charles III, said he did not feel safe bringing his wife, former actor Meghan Markle, and their two young children back to Britain and was concerned about his own safety after being chased by paparazzi following a London charity event.Harry’s animosity toward the press dates back to the death of his mother Princess Diana, who died in a car wreck as her driver tried to outrun aggressive photographers in Paris. Harry, whose wife is mixed-raced, cited what he said were racist attitudes and unbearable intrusions of the British media in his decision to leave the United Kingdom.The 39-year-old prince is challenging the decision by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures to provide his security on a “case by case” basis after moving in 2020 to Canada and then California, where he and his family now reside.He said the committee unfairly nixed his security request without hearing from him personally and did not disclose the makeup of the panel, which he later learned included royal family staff. He said Edward Young, the assistant private secretary to the late Queen Elizabeth II, should not have been on the committee because of “significant tensions” between the two men.The Home Office has argued that any tensions between Harry and the royal household staff was irrelevant and that the committee was entitled to its decision because he had relinquished his role as a working member of the family.The case is one of five that Harry has pending in the High Court.The four other lawsuits involve Britain's best-known tabloids, including a case that alleges the publisher of the Daily Mail libeled him when it ran a story suggesting he had tried to hide his efforts to continue receiving government-funded security. A ruling is expected in that case Friday.",2784,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/prince-harry-challenges-uk-governments-decision-strip-security-105379134,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5a2ce59d-689e-4713-a583-6eddea4c5ec5/wirestory_ff8146324be6c1674c26e05f433bb017_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,aggressive intrusion charles photographer canada private disclose strip clear basis detail date story schedule former driver hide office press unfairly learn attitude guard give different tension actor public nixed expect judge household tabloid earlier late continue officer ruling argue protection sussex libel alleges unbearable prince bring home secretary london role fail back california car legal claimed receive elizabeth friday royal offer security tuesday decision mother outrun united involve paris town wreck death racist busy mail markle meghan staff iii british request wife effort executive queen provide assistant member status string hearing persuade bodyguard force case significant challenge police princess year begin high court duke visit irrelevant child relinquish suggest charity work family partly diana entitle ran deny harry committee royalty concerned lawyer makeup daily personally include feel leave government move paparazzo safe follow chase privately pay jeopardizes young panel lawsuit animosity medium safety publisher pending king figure britain edward attend,-0.8993500000000001,0.1077586206896551,10.669212598425196,0.4244736842105263,0,2023-12-05
ABC,Lebanon's Christians feel the heat of climate change in its sacred forest and valley,2023-12-05 01:04:00,KAREEM CHEHAYEB Associated Press,"BCHARRE, Lebanon -- Majestic cedar trees towered over dozens of Lebanese Christians gathered outside a small mid-19th century chapel hidden in a mountain forest to celebrate the Feast of the Transfiguration, the miracle where Jesus Christ, on a mountaintop, shined with light before his disciples.The sunset’s yellow light coming through the cedar branches bathed the leader of Lebanon’s Maronite Church, Patriarch Beshara al-Rai, as he stood at a wooden podium and delivered a sermon. Then the gathering sang hymns in Arabic and the Aramaic language.For Lebanon’s Christians, the cedars are sacred, these tough evergreen trees that survive the mountain’s harsh snowy winters. They point out with pride that Lebanon’s cedars are mentioned 103 times in the Bible. The trees are a symbol of Lebanon, pictured at the center of the national flag.The iconic trees in the country's north are far from the clashes between Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops along the Lebanon-Israel border in recent weeks against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war. The Lebanese government says Israel's use of white phosphorus and other incendiary weapons has burned tens of thousands of olive trees and other crops in the border area, and impoverished Lebanese farmers fear the shells have contaminated their soil.But the long-term survival of the cedar forests is in doubt for another reason, as rising temperatures due to climate change threaten to wipe out biodiversity and scar one of the country’s most iconic heritage sites for its Christians.The lush Cedars of God Forest, some 2000 meters (6,560 feet) above sea level near the northern town of Bcharre, is part of a landscape cherished by Christians. The preserve overlooks the Kadisha Valley -- Aramaic for “sacred” – where many Christians took refuge from persecution over Lebanon’s tumultuous history. One of the world’s largest collections of monasteries remains hidden among the thick trees, caves and rocky outcroppings along the deep, 35-kilometer (22-mile) valley.The United Nations’ culture agency UNESCO in 1998 listed both the cedar forest and the valley as World Heritage Sites. They’ve become popular destinations for hikers and environmentalists from around the world. A growing number of Lebanese of all faiths visit as well, seeking fresh air away from the cities.“People from all religions visit here, not just Christians … even Muslims and atheists,” said Hani Tawk, a Maronite Christian priest, as he showed a crowd of tourists around the Saint Elisha monastery. “But we as Christians, this reminds us of all the saints who lived here, and we come to experience being in this sacred dimension.”Environmentalists and residents say the effects of climate change, exacerbated by government mismanagement, pose a threat to the ecosystem of the valley and the cedar forest.“Thirty or 40 years from now, it’s quite possible to see the Kadisha Valley’s biodiversity, which is one of the richest worldwide, become much poorer,” Charbel Tawk, an environmental engineer and activist in Bcharre – unrelated to Hani Tawk -- told The Associated PressLebanon for years has felt the heat of climate change, with farmers decrying lack of rain, and forest fires wreaking havoc on pine forests north of the country, similar to blazes that scorched forests in neighboring Syria and nearby Greece. Residents across much of the country, struggling with rampant electricity cuts, could barely handle the summer’s soaring heat.Temperatures have been above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in Bcharre, not uncommon along Lebanon’s coastal cities but unusual for the mountainous northern town.Nuns in the medieval Qannoubin Monastery, perched on the side of a hill in the Kadisha Valley, fanned themselves and drank water in the shade of the monastery’s courtyard. They reminisced about when they could sleep comfortably on summer nights without needing much electricity.Already, there are worrying signs of the impact on the cedars and Kadisha.Warmer temperatures have brought larger colonies of aphids that feed on the bark of cedar trees and leave a secretion that can cause mold, Charbel Tawk said. Bees normally remove the secretion, but they have become less active. Aphids and other pests also are lasting longer in the season and reach higher altitudes because of warmer weather.Such pests threaten to stunt or damage cedar growth.Tawk worries that if temperatures continue to change like this, cedars at lower altitudes might not be able to survive. Fires are becoming more of a potential danger.Cedar trees usually grow at an altitude from 700 up to 1,800 meters above sea level. Tawk’s organization has planted some 200,000 cedars over the years at higher altitudes and in areas where they were not present. Some 180,000 survived.“Is it climate change or whatever it is happening in nature that these cedars are able to survive at 2,100 to 2,400 meters?” Tawk asked, while checking on a grove of cedars on a remote hilltop.Local priests and environmental activists have urged Lebanon's government to work with universities to do a wide-ranging study on temperature changes and the impact on biodiversity.But Lebanon has been in the throes of a crippling economic crisis for years. State coffers are dried up, and many of the country’s top experts are rapidly seeking work opportunities abroad.“There is nothing today called the state … The relevant ministries, even with the best intentions, don’t have the financial capabilities anymore,” Bcharre Mayor Freddy Keyrouz said. He said he and mayors of nearby towns have asked residents to help with conservation initiatives and Lebanese diaspora abroad to help with funding.The Maronite Church has strict rules to protect the Cedars of God forest, including keeping development out of it. Kiosks, tourist shops and a large parking lot have been set far away from the forest.“We don’t allow anything that is combustible to be brought into the sacred forest,” said Charbel Makhlouf, a priest at Bcharre’s Saint Saba Cathedral.The Friends of the Cedar Forest Committee, to which Tawk belongs, has been looking after the cedar trees for almost three decades, with the church’s support. It has installed sensors on cedar trees to measure temperature, wind, and humidity, watching for worsening conditions that could risk forest fires.Below the forest in the Kadisha Valley, Tawk points to other concerns.In particular, the spread of cypress trees threatens to crowd out other species, “breaking this equilibrium that we had in the valley,” he said.“We’ve seen them increase and tower over other species, whether it’s taking sunlight, wind, or expanding their roots,” he said. ""It will impact other plants, birds, insects, and all the reptile species down there.”Steps to protect the valley have actually hurt its biodiversity by removing human practices that had been beneficial, Tawk said.In the past, herders grazing their goats and other livestock in the valley helped prevent the spread of invasive species. Their grazing also reduced fire hazards, as did local families collecting deadwood to burn in the winter.But residents left the valley when it became a heritage site and the Lebanese government implemented strict regulations. Few live there now other than a handful of priests and nuns.“Trees have overtaken places where people lived and farmed,” Tawk said. “Now a fire could move from one end of the valley to the other.”Sitting in a cave near the Qannoubine Monastery, Father Hani Tawk listened to the variety of birds chirping in the valley. He said he believes in the community’s faith and awareness of nature, engrained since their ancestors took refuge here.“When you violate that tree, you’re intruding on a long history, and possibly the future of your children,” he said.___",7795,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/lebanons-christians-feel-heat-climate-change-sacred-forest-105379041,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/4deae438-e14b-49c9-b9bc-0b4bbb62f216/wirestory_98dac4a137ddfd6d5b59074a2df5609c_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,today cripple feed believe chapel grazing felt mold secretion present implement dry meter country plant strict engrained week border large organization tourist practice hiker rule ministry abroad sunset valley cut culture specie engineer insect associate barely regulation qannoubine poorer comfortably seek winter worsen continue rain hani survive deliver ancestor mountaintop farmer prevent god reptile tower decade sign worry live number sunlight survival break backdrop root northern agency friend active chirp watch thousand reminisce hazard decry experience violate saba remains blaze tawk snowy tough united gathering coastal point neighbor celsius impoverish lack overtaken branch troop crop presslebanon protect support financial set grove herder long qannoubin particular area bible reach anymore forest olive damage wind national mountain scar majestic miracle resident initiative hidden leader struggle picture left due high visit beshara wreak keyrouz preserve part collect environmentalist work belongs fire unusual sacred pose rocky warmer uncommon father possibly bath degree mention parking lebanon symbol bcharre evergreen white leave iconic temperature state low move world potential transfiguration maronite told thirty humidity phosphorus pine equilibrium show wipe syria crowd rapidly crisis diaspora remote mismanagement christ measure colony community exacerbate electricity pest list relevant happen sleep hurt aramaic shade feast cedar reason century harsh thick weapon threatens invasive call clash priest popular charbel night altitude condition unesco stunt climate foot instal faith longer religion soar study time history hymn stood throe increase dozen capability mountainous future impact nearby similar heat gather light threaten side grow aphid kiosk nation center destination activist patriarch north hill podium worldwide top environmental atheist goat celebrate step change site lush unrelated intrude economic ten biodiversity local overlook small cypress sensor medieval opportunity cave scorch summer persecution arabic hezbollah town collection makhlouf israeli deadwood havoc rise tumultuous livestock reduce fresh urge possible combustible brought human city listen place fear past awareness effect contaminate landscape away church handful nature remove intention wooden freddy ecosystem water year heritage cherished beneficial bee expert fahrenheit child air bird christian family season greece university drank richest committee level variety shop tree shin reminds risk include government check outcropping burn pride development monastery rampant handle deep elisha spread militant farm israel mayor kadisha incendiary refuge jesus muslim shell lot threat yellow expand coffer courtyard recent bark perch conservation lebanese doubt saint sermon,0.27575,0.2694034637588198,10.720224246671336,0.4010627622696588,0,2023-12-05

ABC,'We are officially hostages.' How the Israeli kibbutz of Nir Oz embodied Hamas hostage strategy,2023-12-05 00:20:00,LORI HINNANT Associated Press and SAM MCNEIL Associated Press,"NIR OZ, Israel -- The engineer and his family cowered in the safe room, dark except for a red remote-control light because they feared the gunmen outside his door would notice anything brighter.Eyal Barad had just reconfigured the settings on a homemade traffic camera from his cell phone to monitor the Hamas attack unfolding outside his door in the kibbutz of Nir Oz. But his 6-year-old autistic daughter — hiding in the room with him, her mother and her two siblings — could not understand that their lives depended upon silence. Her cries were building into near-screams.Barad wrapped his arms around the girl, covered her mouth tightly, and looked over her head to his wife. His whispered, agonized question: Should he cut her airflow long enough to knock her unconscious, to keep everybody alive?But he couldn’t risk killing her. He resolved: “We all go, or we all survive.”Eight weeks into the Israel-Gaza war, the recent release of dozens of Israeli hostages – with as many still in captivity – is bringing new focus on what Hamas did on Oct. 7, the day its fighters rounded them up from communities across southern Israel. The kibbutz of Nir Oz is perhaps the best place to understand Hamas’ hostage strategy, an operation that was unprecedented both in scope and execution.For Israelis, Nir Oz stands out as the embodiment of their country’s vulnerability that day, with the absence of Israeli soldiers, the capture of unprotected civilians, their deaths and disappearance into Gaza, and their subsequent exchange for Palestinians. More than 100 Palestinian militants left Nir Oz with some 80 of its roughly 400 residents. That means people from the kibbutz made up a third of the 240 hostages taken in all and nearly half of the Israelis released, with more than 30 still believed to be in Gaza.Around 20 Nir Oz residents were killed on Oct. 7, and news of deaths in Gaza has started to trickle in.Those seized from the kibbutz ranged in age from 9 months to 85 years. All were civilians, and more than half were women and children. All 13 Israeli hostages released in the first exchange on Nov. 24 were from Nir Oz, and they bought the freedom of 39 Palestinian prisoners from Israel.A review of hundreds of messages among Nir Oz residents shared exclusively with The Associated Press, direct interviews with 17 and accounts from many more, security camera footage and Hamas’ own instructions manuals suggests that the group planned well ahead of time to target civilians. Four experts in hostage situations agreed that Hamas’ actions, both the day of the attack and afterwards, indicated a plan to seize civilians to prepare for the war to come.Danielle Gilbert, a political scientist at Northwestern University who researches hostage-taking, said Hamas and other armed groups generally use hostages as human shields or as currency to negotiate an exchange. But the difference here, she said, is that most armed groups take able-bodied adult men.“It is extremely rare for armed groups to kidnap children, to kidnap women, to kidnap the elderly and people who are otherwise vulnerable,” she said. “The hostage taker needs to make sure that their hostage can survive captivity.”Gilbert feared Hamas would see the strategy as as relatively successful, at least in the short term, and potentially worth repeating.“As much as I hate to say it,” she added, “hostage taking works.”Hamas has hinted at capturing hostages, but has been vague in public statements about whether it planned to kidnap a maximum of civilians.“We were shocked by this colossal collapse. We had expected, planned to win, enter the settlements and get what we wanted and take hostages for exchange. But this army was a paper tiger,” Ali Barakeh, a Hamas official in Beirut, told The Associated Press on Oct. 9.Deliberate intent is also laid out in a manual entitled “How to take Captives,” which the Israeli army said it found among dead Hamas militants in another kibbutz attacked on Oct. 7: “Separate and isolate (women and children/men). Kill the difficult ones and those who pose a threat.”Hamas’ attack on Nir Oz started a little after 6:30 a.m. and lasted 9 long hours.The first word that something was wrong came at 6:35 a.m. on the kibbutz chat app: “Heavy gunfire has been fired at the council’s communities and other communities throughout the country. Stay in protected spaces or the most protected there is until further notice.”Two cars then streamed past the Nir Oz security cameras into the kibbutz, followed by five gunmen, including one who fired a volley into the empty guard post, according to footage seen by AP. The footage is timestamped 6:49 a.m.Sagui Dekel-Chen was tinkering in the kibbutz machine shop when he saw the armed intruders and raced to a rooftop for a better look. His voice message to the community WhatsApp group was tense: “I believe there are gunshots inside the kibbutz. Everybody: Lock your doors and whoever has a weapon arm yourself.”Dekel-Chen, an Israeli-American, ran home, helped his pregnant wife and their two daughters into the safe room end rigged the door so it couldn’t be opened from the outside. Then the 35-year-old father borrowed a gun and prepared to defend the kibbutz with the rest of the community security volunteers, according to his father, Jonathan Dekel-Chen.By then, almost everyone was in their safe rooms. Nearly every Israeli household has one of these rooms, which are designed as shelters against Hamas rockets. But in communities near Gaza, like Nir Oz, they are stocked with particular care, often with beds, food, water and spare batteries, and residents use them routinely. Few have locks.Inside her darkened room with her adult daughter and dog, Irit Lahav was messaging with her brother, who was in his own saferoom in another kibbutz. He warned her to find a way to block her door as quickly as possible.A jewelry designer, Lahav has an eye for seeing the potential in unusual objects. She combined an oar, a vacuum cleaner hose and a long leather cord to block the handle, yanking on the cord from time to time if she saw slack. She watched messages, each one more fearful than the last, flash across her screen to the sound of gunshots outside.“I keep thinking that the army will come at any minute,” she said.Four hours passed. Five.A journalist who accompanied Hamas stood on the front lawn of Ada Sagi, the kibbutz Arabic teacher, and excitedly narrated as gunmen raced around him. A stream of Palestinian men, women and children followed, according to Hamas videos and witnesses. Many Palestinians in Gaza see the kibbutzim as illegal settlements on historic lands that they had never set foot in before that day.“After an hour or more of walking, we were able to enter a kibbutz; the most important kibbutz of the occupation,” he said, according to the video widely streamed on Palestinian news sites. “Here is a scene from the heart of the settlement.”The men who shot out the guard post were the first of about seven groups of armed fighters. In all, the Israeli military and kibbutz residents estimate as many as 150 men arrived in cars and pickups nearly simultaneously from different directions, armed to the teeth. The messages flew back and forth on the kibbutz chat and various residents’ WhatsApp groups.9:16 a.m. “How do you lock the safe room?????”10:15 a.m. “We are officially hostages.”10:19 a.m. “They are threatening to blow up the house if we don’t open up.”One by one, people dropped out of the flow of messages. Some would later appear in Hamas videos.One terrified mother clutches her two redheaded toddlers as they’re led away in a blanket, her eyes huge with fear. A boy is hauled away by his armpits. An elderly woman is pulled to her feet after tumbling off a motorcycle.The quality of images from Barad’s traffic camera was grainy, because it was intended originally just to capture speeding vehicles. A white pickup truck pulled in front of his house, and armed men jumped off and walked off-screen. For about half an hour, the screen filled with the movement of motorcycles, bicycles, stolen farm machinery and gunmen.Then one attacker emerged from the left, firmly pulling a clearly reluctant unarmed man by the hands. A few minutes later, a motorcycle drove past carrying three people. A cap covered the face of the person trapped in the middle, much smaller than the two others.From the house across the road, a gunman took position near the closed safe window. A second man yanked open the metal shutter and pulled out a woman. They covered her face and head with a white cloth.Barad recorded the images of the gunmen taking her, because it was the only thing he could do. He would replay the scene in his head for weeks.“It looked very rehearsed,” Barad said. “It looked like this was the plan.”As the Barad family’s safe room filled with smoke, two adolescent brothers were frantically messaging their mother in a nearby kibbutz. It was dawn after a rare night out for Renana Gome Yaacov, who trusted her 16-year-old son to be responsible for his 12-year-old brother.Her ex-husband and his girlfriend lived within a few hundred meters (yards), she reasoned, so the boys could get help if an emergency arose. Then the alarms sounded across the area.Around 8:10 a.m., one of the boys called in a whisper: The gunmen were in the house. A few minutes later, another call: Their father had been shot.Still on the open phone line, she heard the safe room door burst open, with voices shouting in Arabic, which she does not understand. Her younger son tried to reason with the men.“I could hear him say to them, ‘Don’t take me. I’m too young,’” she recalled. Then the line went dead.Yaacov was bitterly aware that in one cruel way she was lucky.“Some people will probably never know what happened to their dear ones,"" she said, reflecting on the overheard conversation. “I heard it live.”More messages followed between residents.12:07 p.m. “I have a gunshot wound in my leg. A bullet went through the door”12:09 p.m. “Press a cloth as hard as you can on the wound. Tie it”12:37 p.m. “Is there a chance they’re in the house while it’s burning? I do not know if I should remove my hand”12:38 p.m. “Do NOT remove your hand. Just switch hands every so often.Still no Israeli soldiers.A Hamas video shot under midafternoon light shows a relatively orderly procession of stolen cars, motorcycles and farm equipment headed across the fields back to Gaza. They carried with them one in every five residents of Nir Oz.Batsheva Yaalomi was captured along with her husband and their three children. They were separated, and she was placed on a motorcycle with her 10-year-old daughter and the baby. At some point, they managed to scramble off in the fields. She held the baby tight, and they crawled her way through the furrows until after nightfall and escaped.Finally, sometime around 3:30 p.m., Israeli soldiers arrived. All the Hamas fighters had already left Nir Oz. It took hours longer for the soldiers to confirm that none of the houses was booby-trapped and escort residents from their safe rooms.Yaalomi's son, 12-year-old son Eitan, was among those freed during the recent truce, as were both Yaacov boys. Also freed were Ada Sagi, the teacher whose front lawn took center stage in a militant propaganda video; and Yafa Adar, the 85-year-old grandmother who was among the first hostages released by Hamas.But the fathers of Eitan and the Yaacov brothers are still among the missing, as is Sagui Dekel-Chen, who sounded the first alarm.The two youngest hostages, the redheads from Nir Oz – a 4-year-old and his 10-month-old brother – also remain missing, along with their mother. Hamas has said they were killed.Jonathan Dekel-Chen, Sagui’s father and a historian by profession, has methodically gathered accounts from throughout the community to piece together what happened. The Israeli military said no dead Hamas militants were found.“This was not an attempt to conquer territory,” Dekel-Chen said. “This was not an attempt at any kind of liberation. This mission or massacre was extremely well-organized — it must have taken months if not years, cost a fortune.”Hamas went into the kibbutz knowing Judaism’s historical preoccupation with hostages, said Étienne Dignat, a French expert on international hostage situations. The Talmud, a set of commentaries on the Torah, specifically condones ransoming of hostages as a communal responsibility, and many ancient scholars considered being hostage a fate worse than death. But the scholars warned against paying too high a price to avoid endangering Jews in the future.“They knew they were going to have the opportunity to enter kibbutzim, which had never happened before,” Dignat said. “And obviously, afterwards, they knew the particular Israeli sensitivity to the fate of women and children.”In all, 240 Palestinian women and teenage prisoners were exchanged during the truce for 110 hostages — 85 Israelis and 25 foreigners.Israel has a long history of agreeing to lopsided exchanges. Hamas’ 2006 seizure of a sole young conscript, Gilad Shalit, consumed Israeli society for five years, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ultimately ordered the release of over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for his freedom. Netanyahu’s own brother, Yonatan, led an elite commando squad that successfully rescued 98 hostages from an airplane hijacking in Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976. Yonatan Netanyahu and four hostages were killed.One of the first hostages to be freed, Yocheved Lifshitz, told a news conference that their first destination was a large room, where about 25 captives were gathered. Then she and four others from Nir Oz, including an injured man, were taken to another room. A few days in – and in another sign of their significance – Hamas leader Yehya Sinwa met with the Nir Oz hostages, she later told Israeli media.

ABC,Brutal killings of women in Western Balkan countries trigger alarm and expose system,2023-12-05 00:09:00,"JOVANA GEC Associated Press, SABINA NIKSIC Associated Press, and ZANA CIMILI Associated Press","BELGRADE, Serbia -- A man in Bosnia killed his wife and streamed the murder live on Instagram. In neighboring Serbia, 27 women were killed in gender-based attacks this year, despite efforts to raise awareness and reverse the trend. Activists in Kosovo say violence against women there is a “national emergency.”Throughout the Western Balkans, women are harassed, raped, beaten and killed, often by their partners and after repeatedly reporting the violence to the authorities. The region is staunchly conservative, with a centuries-old tradition of male dominance, but the problem surged following the wars in the 1990s and the political, economic and social crises that have persisted since the conflicts ended.In response, women’s groups in the region have organized protests to draw public attention and demand action. They have set up help lines and shelters for women. But activists blame authorities for not acting more decisively to protect women and counter a culture of impunity.The public in Bosnia and in the wider region was brutally shaken into reality in August, when a woman in the northeastern Bosnian town of Gradacac was shot in the head by her former partner, in a live video on Instagram.The murder was “so gruesome and so tragic” that it was an “eye-opener,"" said Jadranka Milicevic, from the Cure (Girls) group.In the Western Balkans, most countries have passed laws and regulations to combat violence against women but implementation remains incoherent, activists say.Bosnia, for example, was among the first countries to ratify the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention on violence against women, but the problem has only grown since then, Milicevic said.“Violence against women and domestic violence are a global phenomenon. They exist everywhere, but it is the state response to the violence that is the key issue,” explained Vanja Macanovic, from the Autonomous Women's Center in Serbia. “Unfortunately, what we see here (in the Balkans) is that violence is approved. It is a model of behavior that is not sufficiently condemned in public.""“We have signed all relevant international declarations, resolutions and conventions but their application is questionable,“ said Milicevic. ""Too many people still perceive (domestic) violence as a private issue, a private matter between two people. They do not understand that it is a social problem.”Observers cite Bosnia's lenient sentences for violence and killing of women as one of the key problems. A 2022 report by GREVIO, an expert body monitoring the implementation of the Istanbul Convention, said such court practices feed a “sentiment of impunity” that is felt strongly by both the perpetrators and their victims.Only once was a murderer sentenced to the 40-year maximum in a case where a woman was the victim, Milicevic said. A total of 65 women have been killed in the past 10 years and five have survived attempted murders in the country of 3.3 million people, local data shows.The situation is similar in Kosovo, another highly patriarchal and male-oriented Balkan society. There, the rape last year of an 11-year-old girl by five assailants triggered street protests demanding safety for women, which led to the resignation of the police chief.But protesters were out in the streets again later in 2022, angered by two killings in the capital Pristina. A 63-year-old geography teacher was killed by her axe-wielding husband, while a pregnant woman was tracked down outside a hospital by her husband, who killed her while she was waiting to give birth.A total of 66 women have been killed by partners or husbands since 2000 in Kosovo, a nation of 2 million, while only one perpetrator has been sentenced to life in prison, official statistics show.Serbian activist Macanovic believes part of the problem is that “institutions are not being held responsible"" and there is no consequence for mistakes in handling the cases. This discourages women from turning to the state for help, especially in smaller communities, she added.“We do not have a well-structured system of responsibility for every professional for wrongful action, or rather lack of action,” she said. It is rare for police officers, social services, prosecutors or court officials to be held to account if mistakes are made and a woman is later killed.Faced with a surge in violence and killings of women, in 2017 Serbia began implementing a special law to deepen cooperation between agencies, take immediate measures against attackers and set up local working groups on the prevention of violence.Bosnia, too, passed a law on the prevention of domestic violence several years ago. But in the societies that went through wars, where economies and institutions have crumbled, and where ethnic, political and social divisions are fuelled by authorities rather than countered, legal changes alone are not enough, say experts.Violence has persisted and will continue, believes Vesna Stanojevic, who runs a chain of safe houses for women in Serbia. “Sometimes we take in women who are beaten so hard that they cannot walk or move their head, who have come after being in a hospital, who are about to give birth, have stomach injuries,” she said.""Where did they (attackers) learn that? Who are role models for our children""?"" she asked. “We should educate and we (societies) obviously are not doing it.""Currently, more than 40 women and children are staying in the shelters run by her organization, she said. “In my 32 years of work, I haven't seen violence decline ... Sometimes there is more, sometimes less, but generally it is always there.""In one of the shelters, a 26-year-old woman said in an interview she decided to leave her partner when she noticed bruises also on their baby son. The woman, who wouldn't give her name for security reasons, said her partner repeatedly raped her, beat and choked her, and kept her and the baby locked in their flat for hours at a time.",5924,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/brutal-killings-women-western-balkan-countries-trigger-alarm-105378301,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c3db8126-ee29-44f0-af63-16428a465735/wirestory_d1496da277dafde5c43d06ef1c580f63_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,feed believe felt model report decide private draw chain august implement bruise teacher country responsible male impunity social gruesome organization law practice political hospital division rape learn murderer notice violence culture despite make cure turn regulation fuel decline stanojevic continue capital woman crumble declaration western survive tragic region harass serbia sign belgrade live global account lenient role lock mistake agency milicevic vesna dominance persist data security domestic official hard service remains especially reverse flat wrongful bosnia million neighbor lack run balkan protect set sentiment stay wife effort response discourages system maximum istanbul national conflict phenomenon consequence educate economy wait group authority police baby shelter approve tracked grevio part repeatedly situation work gradacac kill wider matter pristina girl partner key leave currently state beaten move safe total follow rap act jadranka surge observer ratify shot crisis conservative choked measure safety convention angered community institution relevant protester protest bosnian staunchly immediate pregnant reason resignation stomach reality former implementation killing give time explain cooperation action public husband sufficiently similar perceive international trend interview officer vanja trigger problem street nation head behavior center activist demand questionable autonomous council unfortunately attacker legal exist change hour issue deepen injury victim patriarchal macanovic economic local ago tradition grown condemn geography small held birth town incoherent monitoring walk prosecutor prevention brutally europe awareness past perpetrator prison sentence case line house statistic kosovo stream video beat understand generally decisively year begin assailant resolution court professional expert child attention raise attack highly shaken murder blame northeastern organize strongly body rare special life society lead handle combat attempt ethnic application responsibility counter pass instagram reporting,-0.9986,0.6076975016880485,9.835599639314696,0.343608342561831,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,"Israel’s Netanyahu is fighting two wars, and may not win either",2023-12-05 00:01:00,Ishaan Tharoor,"You’re reading an excerpt from the Today’s WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting two wars. He is at the head of a wartime cabinet, leading the operation against the militant group Hamas after its Oct. 7 rampage through southern Israel saw the bloodiest day for Jews since the Holocaust. But, after nearly two months of conflict and more than 15,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, Netanyahu has waded into another battle: Trial proceedings over long-standing corruption allegations involving the prime minister resumed Monday.The resumption came after Israel’s justice minister, Yariv Levin, declared the emergency situation at Israel’s courts over on Friday. Courts had stopped hearing nonurgent cases in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7 strike, but the long-ruling prime minister is now at least theoretically back in the dock. Netanyahu did not attend the hearing, but he will probably be called to testify during the defense case in the spring.“Netanyahu was charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in late 2019, making him the first Israeli prime minister to be indicted while in office. Netanyahu has denied all allegations and dismissed the claims as a ‘witch hunt,’” my colleagues reported. “He has been indicted in two other cases in Israel.”Netanyahu’s legal dramas have shadowed Israeli politics for close to half a decade. They are the subtext to the prime minister’s angry campaigns against the country’s judiciary and independent media. And they have probably motivated Netanyahu’s quest for continued power and potential immunity, leading him to engineer a return to office after elections in 2022 at the head of the most far-right coalition in Israel’s history. He can be forced to resign only if convicted, which could be years from now.In the wake of the Oct. 7 attack, Netanyahu’s position has grown all the more conspicuous. Angry and traumatized by Hamas’s bloody reach, which also saw the militants abduct more than 200 Israeli hostages, the Israeli public has clamored for tough action. But many Israelis also blame Netanyahu for presiding over the deadliest day in the history of the Jewish state and resent his attempts since to shift blame onto the Israeli defense establishment. The visible friction between Netanyahu’s cabinet and the grieving families of hostages has also struck a chord in Israeli society.In recent days, protesters have returned to picket Netanyahu’s residence, clamoring for his resignation. Polls show that a vast majority of Israelis want him out either immediately or as soon as hostilities cease. On Monday, opposition leader Yair Lapid called once more for the prime minister to quit. “He who failed cannot go on,” Lapid posted on social media. “He whose name is inscribed with disaster, lost the army’s confidence and the people’s trust, should do the one decent thing and go.”Lapid, who served briefly as prime minister in 2022 as part of an anti-Netanyahu coalition that ultimately collapsed, also told reporters that had the tables been turned and Netanyahu been out of office, he would be clamoring for Lapid’s “head on a platter.” Lapid has floated the possibility of entering a unity government led by Netanyahu’s Likud party, but absent Netanyahu himself. Former prime minister Ehud Barak has also joined the chorus, telling Britain’s Channel 4 that, “in a normal country, [Netanyahu] would resign on Oct. 8.”Now, in the middle of a staggering crisis, Netanyahu is fighting for what’s left of his political career, while also trying to satisfactorily defeat Hamas. The endgame on both fronts looks fraught for the prime minister. Experts struggle to see how Netanyahu can survive in office after the war — even the venerated prime minister Golda Meir had to bow out after the shock of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. And it may also prove difficult for Israel to clinch the sort of maximalist victory sought by Netanyahu’s far-right allies.After pummeling northern Gaza, Israel is pressing ahead with its campaign in the south of the beleaguered territory. The mounting death toll and wide-scale devastation have infuriated Arab governments and worried Israel’s Western allies. Over the weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron questioned whether the “total destruction of Hamas” is “possible” and said such a task would require war for a decade.U.S. officials hope Israel can rein in its operation in a matter of weeks. They have warned Netanyahu about restricting civilian casualties — to little concrete effect — and are privately working toward forging some kind of mediated postwar arrangement. On that front, Netanyahu has appeared at odds with the Biden administration, which wants the Palestinian Authority to return and govern Gaza. Netanyahu earlier ruled out that possibility, while his government has floated plans to U.S. lawmakers to force Arab governments to take in Gaza’s population.As battles rage, though, there’s no clear picture on what Israel actually wants once the dust settles. “Israelis say they don’t want to return to an occupation of Gaza. But they are discussing security enhancements such as a buffer zone along its border with Israel and access to the territory for Israeli forces during a transition period that would revoke some elements of autonomy from Gaza’s residents,” my colleagues reported. “The Biden administration hotly opposes any restrictions on how Gazans can use their land, and is eager for Israeli forces to turn over responsibility, possibly to international forces pledged by Arab nations, for the territory’s security.”Some of Netanyahu’s coalition allies see things rather differently and have openly called for Gaza’s depopulation of Palestinians. The prime minister hoped to pin his legacy on the normalization deals made between Israel and a clutch of Arab monarchies, but those governments may find it too toxic to deal closely with an Israel led by Netanyahu and his far-right allies.As my colleagues have reported, Netanyahu spent years tacitly tolerating Hamas’s existence in Gaza. The faction’s schism with the feckless leadership of the Palestinian Authority plunged the Palestinian national movement into an extended crisis and undermined what momentum there was for a two-state solution that no one on the Israeli right seems to want. Netanyahu helped support that status quo, allowing the transfer of Qatari funding to Gaza, among other measures to ease pressure on the Islamist group. Now, that arrangement may lead to his undoing.“The asymmetrical power relations between Israel, a formidable military power, and Hamas, a non-state terror organization, are evident,” observed Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general to New York. “For Hamas, a win can be declared if they stand on their feet and wave a single flag. For Israel, only a decisive military triumph that degrades Hamas militarily and renders it politically incapacitated will be enough. Netanyahu is well aware of that, which makes balancing the pressure from home and from the US an intractable task.”",7173,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/05/netanyahu-wars-win-lose-political-endgame-career/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,benjamin today continued report quo normalization ehud interest country opinion depopulation yair restriction social emergency week border buffer organization convict picket political deal rule press differently clutch probably make absent engineer toxic qatari conspicuous resumption turn poll earlier hostility weekend inscribed briefly ultimately mediate tacitly shift administration western survive visible sought jew plunge decade meir quest nonurgent residence shock sign pummel abduct opposition decisive fail postwar back northern restrict yariv period emmanuel military free majority wad immunity army palestinian security netanyahu official degrades theoretically bow eager tough hope general dust difficult holocaust shadow openly support election wake drama clinch float reporter bloodiest normal corruption opposes south bribery return motivate lawmaker reach terror confidence venerate status legacy monarchy national require conflict party force resident group leader authority rest bloody struggle picture resume left land stop prime coalition toll satisfactorily part territory schism work situation join kill matter deny arrangement endgame possibly vast position element observe govern state momentum justice potential defense total proceeding told hunt testify dock pressure resent news kippur show kind feckless islamist battle crisis strike enter intractable aware measure independent gaza formidable establishment middle wave revoke protester monday britain power attend half golda occupation alon maximalist win southern faction transition worldview witch angry movement globe enhancement civilian preside destruction resignation clear call plan biden former wartime mount trust foot office career history action public ally solution late international access front cease gazans infuriate colleague find nation home head evident lapid hamas devastation post ahead transfer defeat odds extend spent asymmetrical charge legal president friday arab stagger deadliest grown single possibility grieve cabinet hostage judiciary forge involve dismiss decent trial friction prove pinkas serve israeli death inbox settle month allegation resign minister question immediately excerpt rampage existence channel possible reading breach york undermined barak macron leadership funding closely newsletter effect quit incapacitate pin fraud hearing politically flag case claim discuss chorus disaster hop day year stand tolerate court campaign expert victory chord triumph attack close hotly declare family traumatize casualty politics militarily french blame beleaguer include collapse worried jewish concrete government table unity indict struck fight idea lead levin subtext privately attempt balance render militant task sort israel relation operation rein likud rage warn consul medium pledge zone responsibility ease autonomy recent lose yom fraught clamor,-0.9976,0.2091175240485152,10.048601503759397,0.410586124401914,0,2023-12-05
Reuters,"Senior US official visits India, discusses alleged plot to kill Sikh separatist",2023-12-04 23:34:00,Kanishka Singh,"WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer led a U.S. delegation to New Delhi on Monday where he noted the formation of an investigative panel by India to probe an unsuccessful plot to assassinate a Sikh separatist on U.S. soil.""Mr. Finer acknowledged India's establishment of a Committee of Enquiry to investigate lethal plotting in the United States and the importance of holding accountable anyone found responsible,"" the White House said in a statement on Monday.Last week, the U.S. Justice Department alleged that an Indian government official directed an unsuccessful plot to assassinate a Sikh separatist on U.S. soil, while it announced charges against a man accused of orchestrating the attempted murder.U.S. officials have named the target of the attempted murder as Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the United States and Canada.In response, India expressed concern about one of its government officials being linked to the plot, from which it dissociated itself, as being against government policy.India said last week it would formally investigate the concerns aired by the U.S., and take ""necessary follow-up action"" on the findings of a panel set up on Nov. 18.News of the incident came two months after Canada said there were ""credible"" allegations linking Indian agents to the June murder of another Sikh separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in a Vancouver suburb, a contention India has rejected.U.S. President Joe Biden, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, CIA director Bill Burns and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have discussed this issue with their Indian counterparts in recent weeks.The issue is highly delicate for both India and the Biden administration as they try to build closer ties in the face of an ascendant China perceived as a threat for both democracies.The Indian government has long complained about the presence of Sikh separatist groups outside India. New Delhi views them as security threats. The groups have kept alive the movement for Khalistan, or the demand for an independent Sikh state to be carved out of India.Finer met Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. They also discussed developments in the Middle East, including the Israel-Hamas war, plans for a post-war Gaza and recent attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, the White House said on Monday.",2432,https://www.reuters.com/world/senior-us-official-visits-india-discusses-alleged-plot-kill-sikh-separatist-2023-12-04/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/WFAI6EYFFJKSFJEJNLOOTU5PEQ.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,sullivan incident canada movement link gurpatwant responsible dissociate biden complain alive east plan week announce counterpart finer action jake perceive allege indian agent concern express administration build view investigative secretary importance pannun ascendant tie department antony contention commercial demand charge president issue accountable washington security official suburb formation finding assassinate lethal formally united ajit credible blinken separatist month allegation minister vancouver set accuse dec nijjar soil long sikh response june dual delegation khalistan bill national china discuss house leader delicate group cia orchestrate acknowledge red attack citizen air highly target director india found delhi singh plot committee murder hold vessel include white government state presence burn mr justice development lead closer note attempt direct hardeep panel statement jon investigate enquiry adviser jaishankar independent threat deputy gaza doval establishment middle joe probe recent monday unsuccessful carve foreign reuters,-0.7121500000000001,0.1233552631578947,12.487541766109782,0.2844065656565657,0,2023-12-04
ABC,At least 6 people have died as heavy rains from Tropical Cyclone Michaung hit India's coasts,2023-12-04 23:10:00,The Associated Press,"NEW DELHI -- Torrential rains and strong winds lashing India's southern and eastern coasts have killed at least six people, officials said, as states there braced for a powerful storm expected to make landfall later Tuesday.The southern states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, as well as Odisha in the east, experienced heavy downpours Monday as authorities issued warnings for Tropical Cyclone Michaung, which is likely to hit the southern coast with maximum sustained winds of 90-100 kph (56-62 mph) and gusts up to 110 kph (68 mph), the Indian Meteorological Department said.A deep depression over the Bay of Bengal intensified into a tropical storm Monday as it inched towards Bapatla, a coastal district in Andhra Pradesh state.On Monday night, authorities in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, said six people in the city had died as the impending storm unleashed rains that caused trees to topple and walls to collapse, and submerged roads and cars in knee-deep waters.Videos showed water streaming onto the city's airport tarmac, forcing authorities to shut it down and divert more than 30 flights while around 70 were canceled, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.Schools were shut in Andhra Pradesh, where the storm might make landfall, and officials evacuated nearly 2,000 people from coastal and low-lying villages with instructions to move over 7,000 more to safer areas, local media reported.Tamil Nadu authorities have set up nearly 5,000 relief camps in coastal areas. In Chennai, rescuers used boats to evacuate hundreds of people stranded on the roads and inside homes that had filled with floodwaters. Chief Minister M.K.

CNN,Oxford’s word of the year 2023 is just brimming with charisma,2023-12-04 23:08:00,Hafsa Khalil,"Language experts choosing the Oxford word of the year 2023 were dazzled by a bright young thing, selecting a relative newcomer, “rizz,” for the top spot.Derived from the word “charisma,” “rizz” refers to a person’s ability to attract a romantic partner through “style, charm or attractiveness,” dictionary publisher Oxford University Press (OUP) said in its announcement Monday. The word received more than 32,000 votes from the public, OUP added.“Rizz” soared in popularity earlier this year, after Spider-Man actor Tom Holland was asked by Buzzfeed what the secret to his rizz was. His answer? “I have no rizz whatsoever. I have limited rizz.”The publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary added that the word can also be used as a verb, in the phrase “rizz up,” meaning to attract or chat up a person.While word of the year contenders do not need to be new words, they must have a significance to the year in question. OUP said its 2023 shortlist was chosen to “reflect the mood, ethos, or preoccupations of the year.”So, how did “rizz” fight off its rivals?OUP’s experts shortlisted eight words, which were put into competing pairs for the public to vote on. From the resulting four finalists, the experts did one last analysis, before picking “rizz” as the winner.The other finalists were “prompt,” the instruction given to an artificial intelligence program that influences the content it creates; “situationship,” which means a romantic partnership that is not considered to be formal or established; and lastly, “Swiftie” - the name given to an avid fan of singer Taylor Swift.In 2022, Oxford’s word of the year was “goblin mode,” a colloquial term for behavior that is unapologetically lazy in a way that rejects social norms.",1735,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/world/oxford-word-of-the-year-2023-intl-scli-gbr/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204092751-tom-holland-112923.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,result ability charm pair taylor chat oxford social shortlist romantic press soar give situationship actor public influence popularity chosen earlier verb rival consider swiftie reflect announcement relative behavior style instruction partnership top limited select content newcomer receive meaning dictionary charisma choose bright mood finalist artificial singer holland language add preoccupation goblin attractiveness question phrase avid whatsoever establish dazzle rizz prompt formal secret colloquial year expert compete contender english tom norm university intelligence ethos analysis word partner program fight lazy refers oup pick young answer significance attract term reject lastly creates publisher buzzfeed vote monday unapologetically put person,0.9613,0.1729106628242074,7.600449438202247,0.4145588538445681,0,2023-12-04
ABC,Mexico halts deportations and migrant transfers citing lack of funds,2023-12-04 22:48:00,MARÍA VERZA Associated Press,"MEXICO CITY -- The head of Mexico’s immigration agency has ordered the suspension of migrant deportations and transfers due to a lack of funds amid a record-setting year for migration through the country’s territory.The suspensions were outlined in an agency memo dated Dec. 1 from director Francisco Garduño, whose authenticity was confirmed to the Associated Press by an agency official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.Mexico’s finance ministry suspended payments to the National Immigration Institute in November due to end-of-year budget adjustments, according to the memo.Citing budget constraints “and the lack of liquidity to cover commitments,” Garduño ordered a halt to various agency activities, most notably the “assisted returns,” a government euphemism to describe deportations, and “ground transportation for transfer of irregular migrants.”Mexico's government had been frequently moving migrants from points north near the U.S. border to locations in the south in part to relieve pressure on border cities, but also to exhaust migrants, according to advocates.Mexico has recorded nearly 590,000 undocumented migrants in its territory this year, a significant increase compared to 440,000 in all of last year and fewer than 310,000 in 2021, according to government data.Mexico has already deported far fewer migrants this year than in recent years. From January to October, the government deported 51,000 migrants, compared to nearly 122,000 in all of last year and more than 130,000 in 2021.Deportations had precipitously dropped in April following a fire at a migrant detention center in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas.The fire killed 40 migrants and injured 27 more. The tragedy threw the immigration agency into chaos and it temporarily closed dozens of its detention centers. Garduño and seven other officials face criminal charges related to the deadly fire. Six of them were charged with homicide.Deportations had just picked up again in October, when Mexico began sending migrants back to their countries, including flights to Cuba and Venezuela.With the halt to funding, “Mexico is likely to rely more heavily on National Guard soldiers for migration management, a mission that they are barely prepared to fulfill,” said Adam Isacson, an immigration analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America.“The result is likely to be a sharp decline in Mexico’s migrant apprehensions during December, and migrants may have a modestly easier time than usual reaching the U.S. border.”____",2567,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-halts-deportations-migrant-transfers-citing-lack-funds-105377030,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9ff396d6-e7a6-45d2-ab9d-455c30424e18/wirestory_17615ace23d0677bb443d8386e254fbc_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,apprehension result fund deport related october authorize amid tragedy country migrant date border payment discus outline temporarily criminal office press ministry analyst modestly juarez guard confirm time drop rely frequently increase associate commitment migration dozen barely decline december immigration easy mission management sharp head compare center chaos transfer irregular north isacson threw authenticity back charge agency april record washington institute relieve official suspend usual picked point lack deadly detention request cuba mexico south injured latin return reach january city accord funding memo describe national halt paso activity significant location finance assist fulfill year begin due ciudad exhaust deportation part territory close fire director kill ground order soldier constraint include heavily government francisco suspension move liquidity follow pressure anonymity prepared transportation euphemism precipitously garduño flight send adam cover recent undocumented november budget notably adjustment,-0.9805,0.2337358784573431,13.327356321839076,0.442156862745098,0,2023-12-04
ABC,Thousands protest Indigenous policies of New Zealand government as lawmakers are sworn in,2023-12-04 22:36:00,The Associated Press,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Thousands of protesters rallied against the New Zealand government’s Indigenous policies on Tuesday as the Parliament convened for the first time since October elections.Demonstrations in the capital, Wellington, and in about a dozen other New Zealand cities and towns were organized by the minor Maori Party, which advocates for the rights of Indigenous New Zealanders who are known as Maori.Protesters demonstrated peacefully outside Parliament against what they described as the “anti-Maori” policies of the newly elected conservative-led coalition government.Maori Party co-leader Rawiri Waititi said the new policies of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s administration would take New Zealand “back to the 1800s.”“Our protest this morning was an activation of our people,” Waititi said.The National Party-led government promises to review the Treaty of Waitangi and implement potential changes to how that foundation document signed by British colonists and Maori chiefs in 1840 affects modern laws.The government has also foreshadowed changes to the Maori Health Authority, a statutory agency responsible for ensuring that the New Zealand health system meets Maori needs.Luxon said his government was “deeply committed to improving outcomes for Maori and non-Maori.”“Maori have done very well in National-led governments in the past, and they’re going to continue to do well,” Luxon said.Lawmakers were sworn in on Tuesday after elections on Oct. 14 ousted the center-left Labour Party government that had ruled since 2017.The Maori Party won six of the 123 seats in the 54th Parliament.Party lawmaker Takuta Ferris wore a Maori headdress and performed a haka, a traditional dance or challenge accompanied by a chant, as he crossed the chamber to make an affirmation that confirmed his place in the Parliament.Other Maori Party lawmakers sang traditional Indigenous songs.Some Green Party lawmakers wore the Arab headdress known as the keffiyeh over their shoulders in a sign of support for Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war.Luxon’s National Party won 38% of the vote — the largest proportion of any party. He took almost six weeks after the election to reach a coalition agreement with another two parties: the populist New Zealand First party and the libertarian ACT Party.ACT Party leader David Seymour described the Maori Party protests as “divisive theatrics” that showed disrespect for the election result.“New Zealanders elected a government that will treat people equally, regardless of their race,” Seymour said.",2557,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/thousands-protest-indigenous-policies-new-zealand-government-lawmakers-105377025,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/64958851-f9a2-4f68-b580-47f50b0e30db/wirestory_f2911ce5167d8b0758b5c1a2fc1c6884_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,green foreshadow maori sworn october implement responsible treaty week large rule modern outcome activation time confirm minor wellington deeply ferris make advocate dozen continue capital administration proportion commit sign accompany meet chant headdress back seymour agreement agency morning change thousand newly arab perform palestinian equally tuesday divisive improve peacefully parliament luxon david town treat haka affirmation disrespect support election minister populist british theatrics statutory document lawmaker system christopher described reach colonist city ensure place demonstrate past shoulder keffiyeh chief national seat cross affect party rawiri challenge health leader authority rally prime coalition indigenous convene zealander waititi wore oust policy promise race organize zealand government takuta potential act show traditional libertarian labour foundation waitangi dance vote protester protest chamber review elect,0.98315,0.0,14.307990543735222,0.4173971861471862,0,2023-12-04
CNN,"Boston woman paddleboarding near Bahamas resort killed in shark attack, police say",2023-12-04 22:34:00,not specified,"A 44-year-old American visiting the Bahamas from Boston was killed in a shark attack while paddleboarding near a beach resort Monday, according to local authorities.The woman had traveled to the Bahamas with a male relative, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a news release.“Preliminary reports indicate that the victim, along with a male relative, was paddle boarding away from the shoreline in waters at the rear of a resort in western New Providence when she was bitten by a shark,” the release said.A lifeguard at the resort noticed the attack and went into the water on a boat to try and rescue the victim along with the relative.The lifeguard administered CPR to the woman, police said.“The victim suffered significant trauma to the right side of her body. She was examined on scene by emergency medical technicians, who concluded that she showed no vital signs of life,” the police said in a release.The woman died shortly after 11 a.m. local time, police told CNN.Authorities haven’t released the woman’s identity.CNN has reached out to the US Embassy in the Bahamas for additional information.The incident comes days after a woman was killed in an apparent shark attack at a Mexican resort. The woman was found dead by emergency services at the scene in Melaque Bay in the Cihuatlán municipality.Shark attacks, particularly fatal ones, are rare: On average, sharks kill five people per year in unprovoked attacks, CNN previously reported. The odds of getting fatally attacked by one of the carnivorous fish are less than 1 in 4 million, according to the International Shark Attack File. Experts attribute many shark bites to cases of mistaken identity, particularly in waters with low visibility.Despite their rarity, the attacks still happen on occasion. Last year, a cruise ship passenger was killed by a shark while snorkeling in the Bahamas. And in 2019, an American woman was also killed while snorkeling in the Bahamas after three different sharks attacked her.",1981,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/americas/bahamas-shark-attack-boston-woman/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204204927-01-woman-killed-shark-attack-120423.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,rear emergency apparent dead administer side mistaken expert medical fish indicate suffer attribute case beach relative body attack found ship time average monday rarity happen bay service million additional vital rescue release particularly shoreline international scene embassy told year cnn providence odds news passenger occasion water accord low local woman force bite unprovoked report incident paddle boston victim bahamas life snorkel shortly file significant different fatal resort bitten technician american conclude royal mexican melaque shark lifeguard paddleboarding notice away previously western carnivorous cihuatlán travel day fatally boarding reach kill cruise rare sign trauma preliminary male cpr visit boat show police examine identity,-0.98975,0.757193336698637,10.795320334261838,0.2089709839709839,0,2023-12-04
ABC,"'It’s worse than before the truce': Strikes in Gaza resume at intensified pace, Palestinians say",2023-12-04 21:00:00,Camilla Alcini,"After seven days without bombardments, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip woke up to the familiar sound of airstrikes in the early morning of Dec. 1.""The war is back,"" Shaimaa Ahmed, a 20-year-old engineering student, told ABC News.""We woke up to the sound of gunfire. Ship fire. Tank fire. They're firing from everywhere. It's continuous and strong,"" Ahmed, who had already fled her house on Oct. 31 following the orders of Israel to evacuate northern Gaza, said. ""I feel like I'm being suffocated again.""Israel resumed its retaliatory military operations in Gaza last week after the collapse of a temporary cease-fire as part of a broader hostage-prisoner exchange with Hamas. With thousands forced to flee again, some Palestinians told ABC News the war has resumed at an unprecedented pace and intensity.New evacuation orders on Sunday left thousands to face another displacement in a desperate search for safety. ""The roads leading south towards Rafah [on the border with Egypt] are clogged with cars and donkey carts packed with people and their meager possessions,"" the Director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency Affairs Thomas White wrote on X.Almost two months in, the Israel-Hamas war has left at least 15,899 killed and 42,000 wounded in the Gaza Strip, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run Ministry of Health. In Israel, at least 1,200 have been killed and 6,900 injured, with 136 Israeli hostages still in Gaza, according to the Israel Defense Forces.As the IDF moves forward with a ground operation in southern Gaza in what Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari defined ""a new phase in our war against Hamas,"" Palestinians said there is nowhere to go for safety. Some 1.9 million are currently displaced and moving across the Strip, according to UNRWA.""What's the next step? Is it Sinai or is it heaven? I have no idea,"" 21-year-old Tala Herzallah told ABC News as she prepared to flee again on Saturday, after having evacuated her home in Gaza City a few weeks ago.The IDF leaflets dropped in the Khan Younis during the weekend that warned people to leave the area and a QR code map showed the zones designated as safe by the IDF.“We want civilians not to be in the area where we are fighting,” Israeli Lt. Col Jonathan Conricus told ABC News Monday. “We want to focus our firepower on Hamas and Hamas only.”""Where to go after Khan Younis? There is only one place and it's Rafah and it cannot include 2 million people,"" 24-year-old Younes El-Hallaq told ABC News. ""And more importantly, Rafah itself is being targeted.""In the four days following the end of the cease-fire, 746 have been killed in the strikes, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, with victims in Rafah, too.""Even in Rafah where people are being forced to flee the sound of airstrikes punctuate the day,"" White wrote on X Monday.While many have relocated over the weekend, others have decided to stay where they are either by choice or forced to do so by illnesses, disabilities or lack of accommodation and transport options.""Since the beginning of the war, I have been displaced three times, and now I may go to another place,"" Rasmiya Rabie, 51, from the town of Al-Qarara, north of Khan Yunis, told ABC News.Rabie said her family received many calls from the Israeli army telling them to move to different areas. ""We are a large number and we cannot displace again,"" she said.Then, two days ago, a night of severe bombardment changed their mind.""It was very difficult and that's why we thought about moving for the third time. Now I am trying to find a place to go to,"" Rabie said.With a 75-year-old father and a 72-year-old mother, as well as two young children to care for, Nima Ashour, 43, said she could not leave even if she wanted to. Her family is also out of fuel and money, having evacuated from Al Rantisi Pediatric hospital two weeks ago. Ashour was in the hospital caring for cancer patients from newborns to 12 years old as a pediatric coordinator.""What will we do? We will not do anything. My family has decided to stay at our place,"" Ashour told ABC News.""Even if you move, we do not believe that we are going to be safe. It's the same situation we have faced in Gaza and now in Khan Younis. And for sure if we move anywhere, we'll have the same destruction, the same bombing, the same targeting. At last, we have to face our destiny,"" Ashour said.With the reprisal of the bombing, a sense of fear and defeat has spread widely across the strip, where a severe humanitarian crisis is worsening by the day, representatives of Amnesty International, Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders told ABC News.The aftermath of the end of the cease-fire also saw the first anti-government protest held in Tel Aviv since Oct. 7, shortly after the publication of a report by The New York Times claiming Israel partially knew about the plans for Hamas' Oct. 7 assault more than a year before the terror attack but dismissed it as aspirational.""For the last 57 days, we saw that the government has been doing exactly the opposite of what they need to do,"" the organizer of the protest against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Moshe Radman, told ABC News.""We understand this will be a long war, so we have to do it now, because every week that we are not protesting, Israel is becoming less and less attractive to its citizens,"" he added.",5348,https://abcnews.go.com/International/worse-truce-strikes-gaza-resume-intensified-pace-palestinians/story?id=105364222,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/07645b74-0e64-4862-b6f7-a520fa05a43f/israel-gaza-16-gty-gmh-231204_1701702478324_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,benjamin believe sunday severe younis report decide relocate humanitarian airstrikes rear strip week border large code shortly sound hospital ministry nima aviv fuel weekend worsen desperate pace donkey save punctuate organizer number continuous back idf northern agency morning receive attractive military egypt thousand army evacuate palestinian retaliatory netanyahu evacuation mother unrwa united illness define clog million lack difficult suffocate destiny wound shaimaa stay long south injured area pediatric terror daniel aspirational abc knew force health prime tank resume left conricus part situation work target fire early kill ground rantisi father firepower white leave currently unprecedented move younes safe follow defense told mind accommodation news hagari show write heaven crisis strike road rabie importantly safety woke tala disability cart gaza monday protest student ship meager assault qr southern civilian destruction ahmed call engineering plan radman cancer night focus exchange time yunis different drop khan x sinai option international doctor find nation home hamas strong transport bombing north moshe defeat coordinator jonathan herzallah representative car packed step familiar change victim money ago newborn displacement hostage add dismiss choice held admiral partially town rasmiya aftermath israeli month minister amnesty dec flee york publication city place fear accord designate broader affair search claim house understand ashour year day begin rafah child tel attack citizen family director leaflet order phase include collapse feel widely government thomas bombardment temporary idea fight lead patient forward spread prepared young warn israel operation gunfire map zone possession displace opposite saturday relief reprisal,-0.989,0.3365744203440539,7.398560885608855,0.3473719882810792,0,2023-12-04
CNN,More than 300 killed as heavy rains wreak havoc across East Africa,2023-12-04 16:24:00,Bethlehem Feleke,"Torrential rains and flash floods have ripped through parts of East Africa for several weeks, killing more than 350 people and displacing over 1 million across Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania.In Kenya, at least 136 have died and nearly half a million have been displaced, according to the Interior Ministry. Persistent rains since October have affected 38 out of 47 counties across the country, which have been hit by flash floods, general flooding, and mudslides, President William Ruto revealed in an emergency cabinet meeting last week.The northeastern parts and the eastern coast of the country have been the worst-hit areas with severe damage to homes and infrastructure, including disruptions to cargo rail services from the port of Mombasa last month.The unusually heavy rains are largely caused by the El Niño weather phenomenon and are forecast to continue into the new year by the Kenya Meteorological Department.El Niño is a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and impacts weather all over the world. This phenomenon has been associated with severe flooding in eastern Africa, resulting in landslides, elevated waterborne diseases, and food shortages. Meanwhile, the northern and southern regions of the continent often endure prolonged periods of severe drought during El Niño events.But the Horn of Africa is also one of the world’s most vulnerable regions to climate change. While the overall amount of rain annually is expected to fall in the region the more the Earth warms, the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events are projected to increase. That means the Horn of Africa may experience more drought as well as floods from heavy rain.President Ruto has activated the National Disaster Operation Center to carry out emergency response. On Thursday, the Interior Ministry announced a decrease of rainfall in northern Kenya is expected this week.Speaking at COP28 in Dubai on Friday, Ruto captured the immediate reality and devastation of climate change as witnessed by the catastrophic rains.“The situation in our Horn of Africa region, like many other developing countries, lays bare the harsh reality of climate change,” he said.The extreme flooding comes just months after the region suffered its worst drought in four decades.“Some months back, we were affected by severe drought and now we are complaining about too much water. People are always feeling the stress of these two impacts,” Director of Communication for the Somali Red Crescent Society Abdulkadir Afi told CNN.“Whether there’s less water or too much water, either way, people suffer,” Afi added.According to the United Nation’s humanitarian agency (OCHA), the death toll from flooding has risen to 110 in Somalia and 57 in Ethiopia.In northern Tanzania, authorities said 49 people were killed by floods accompanied by mudslides following heavy rains in the country’s Manyara province.Up to 85 people were reported injured, Manyara governor Queen Sendiga said Monday, according to state media.Tanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan directed response agencies “to help rescue and prevent more disasters from happening.”In eastern Kenya, the deluge has wreaked havoc on the Dadaab Refugee Camp, which is home to some 300,000 refugees. The camp has experienced a significant number of new arrivals over the last three years — some of them fleeing food insecurity and drought conditions in Somalia.In November, in Hagadera, a camp inside the Dadaab complex, three out of the 15 blocks of homes were submerged, leaving around 20,000 people — about 13% of the camp — displaced and sheltering in schools and places of worship, according to the International Rescue Committee (IRC).Aid agencies have reported surges of water-borne diseases like cholera and acute watery diarrhea due to damaged latrines and lack of access to safe drinking water.Relief efforts to reach those in the hardest-hit areas of the camp with food, clean water and medical aid have been hindered by damaged and impassable roads, according to the IRC.“It’s a poignant reminder of its disproportionate impact and a call to action for all of us to mobilize rapidly to address this imbalance with urgency, solidarity, and inclusivity.”",4234,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/africa/east-africa-floods-more-than-300-killed-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210701213958-nimi-princewill-profile-photo-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,impassable severe mombasa report food humanitarian country watery complain latrine mudslide emergency week ripped complex ministry expect associate prolong amount continue earth rain extreme prevent region annually cargo number thursday back flood northern somalia disease period agency shortage infrastructure frequency experience service united torrential decrease solidarity suluhu aid million general tanzania lack medical stress horn inside effort queen response injured area reach damage ethiopia drought diarrhea rail national rainfall phenomenon eastern significant somali hassan school interior county weather authority shelter arrival submerge due toll wreak red part drinking irc situation camp capture urgency kill william niño elevate experienced leave state safe world develop follow told direct surge rapidly pattern kenya forecast road vulnerable meeting mobilize worship acute carry africa monday persistent ocha half immediate southern result dadaab lay abdulkadir october harsh governor hit warms call east reality announce condition climate imbalance affected originates action increase impact deluge meteorological international access crescent heavy nation home center devastation accompany unusually cholera insecurity intensity waterborne address president change dubai friday continent pacific hagadera clean inclusivity disproportionate cabinet catastrophic endure largely death havoc month refugee equator ruto ocean event port communication flee accord place samia reveal disaster reminder poignant afi water year manyara director committee northeastern include feel sendiga landslide society witness hinder project activate block risen operation suffer rescue flash displace coast fall november disruption,-0.99225,0.2834199338686821,12.072258064516124,0.3619199134199135,0,2023-12-04
CNN,"Netanyahu corruption trial resumes, as war rages on",2023-12-04 16:09:00,Stephanie Halasz,"The corruption trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu restarted Monday after a two month pause that followed the state of emergency declared after the October 7 Hamas attacks.Israeli Minister of Justice Yaris Levin lifted the state of emergency effective December 1.Netanyahu’s corruption trial first began in January 2020, making him the first sitting Israeli prime minister to appear in court as a defendant, on trial for charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery. He denies any wrongdoing.The prime minister faces charges in three separate cases.In Case 1000, he is charged with fraud and breach of trust in connection with allegations that he received gifts like cigars and champagne from overseas businessmen.In Case 2000, he is also charged with fraud and breach of trust and is accused of seeking favorable coverage in one of Israel’s top newspapers in exchange for limiting the circulation of one of the paper’s main rivals.In the most serious case, Case 4000, he is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust for allegedly advancing regulatory benefits worth the equivalent of more than $250 million at the time to his friend Shaul Elovitch, who was the controlling shareholder for the telecommunications company Bezeq.In return, the prosecution says, Elovitch ensured positive coverage of the Prime Minister in an online news site he owned called Walla! News. Elovitch has denied the charges.Israeli Minister of Regional Cooperation David Amsalem criticized the resumption of the trial in a time of war.“War? Kidnapped? Evacuees? Economics? No and no… What is most important now is to renew Netanyahu’s trial, and to engage the Prime Minister of Israel with the unfounded testimonies and delusional trifles,” Amsalem, who is also a minister in the Ministry of Justice, said on X.Netanyahu has called the indictments a “stitch-up” and an effort by Israel’s liberal and media elites to topple him and his right-wing bloc. Under Israeli law, he is not required to step down from office unless he is convicted and that conviction is upheld throughout the appeals process.Earlier this year, his government pushed through a law effectively stripping the country’s courts of the power to declare a prime minister unfit for office.

USA TODAY,40 men died in the Juárez detention center fire this year. 5 came from one Guatemala community,2023-12-04 15:17:46,Lauren Villagran,"LA CEIBA, Guatemala — Marcos Abdon Tziquin Cuc chopped wood for his 71-year-old mother and left it neatly stacked by her cook fire before he left his rural village for the U.S. border. The last of Juana Cuc's nine children, 20-year-old Tziquin Cuc wanted to ease his mother's burden. Later, maybe she wouldn't need kindling at all once he had a job in the United States and could buy her glass windows, wood doors and a stovetop like the homes built with U.S. dollars, peppered throughout the lush green forest of his homeland. He never had the chance. ""The only thing I still have of him is the wood outside, because it was Marcos who brought it to me,” Cuc said. “Whenever I go for the wood, I cry.” Tziquin Cuc and 39 other men died in a fire inside a migrant detention center in Juárez, México, on March 27. They burned alive or were suffocated by smoke after the guards – for reasons that are still being investigated – failed to unlock their cell door. The fire came in the middle of a record year for migrant deaths at the El Paso-Juárez border. Their deaths inside a locked cell were an international tragedy – the result, advocates say, of inhumane U.S. and Mexico policies at what the United Nations has deemed the deadliest border in the world. Tziquin Cuc called his mother when Mexican authorities detained his bus on the outskirts of Juárez in March. Rather than worry, Cuc said she and her husband felt relieved. Her son’s journey to the United States was over and he would come home safe, she thought. They would celebrate his 21st birthday in the summer and go to church together again on Sundays. He felt his religion deeply, spent most of his free time at the church volunteering as a missionary. In a photograph, Tziquin Cuc stood between the pews with a rosary around his neck, smiling with the face of a young man who had yet to shed his boyish cheeks. Neighbors came to give her the news. “Many times I believed it, and sometimes I didn’t believe it was true,” she said as she pressed the photo to her chest and cried, her head hanging, gray-and-black braids tied up like a crown. Her husband sat beside her, his eyes focused on the bare concrete floor. At the El Paso-Juárez border, her son and the others are remembered by little more than their names on a government list and the images of their lifeless bodies that night, laid in a parking lot under aluminum blankets in the cold. Cuc keeps the memory of her son warm on a small altar illuminated by candlelight. Nineteen of the fire victims – nearly half the dead – were from Guatemala. No community bore a heavier toll than the Mayan K'iche villages in the country's Sololá state. “The news hit hard, because we had never heard of something happening like this,” said Antonio Chox, an elementary school teacher and community journalist in La Ceiba. Chox lives in La Ceiba, the aldea town that anchors a dozen villages sprinkled along the forested skirt of the volcano Pecul. The volcano rises like a church steeple through the clouds. Banana plants grow two stories tall, and rivers crisscross lush mountain villages linked by their Mayan culture, K'iche language and names. “What caught my attention were the last names,” Chox said. “We are Mayan, and every community has a particular last name. I knew the ones on the list would be our brothers and cousins.” News of the deaths trickled down to La Ceiba, as the hours and days after the middle-of-the-night fire were filled with confusion. On March 29, two days after the fire, Chox put his audio gear in his SUV and headed north to the house of Francisco Tzaj Quemá and Catarina Tambriz Tambriz. He stood with the stoic couple and began to transmit live on Facebook. Hundreds of people began to connect online from the villages around La Ceiba. The community's diaspora – migrants living in Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta – began joining the live feed. “Earlier today, they called directly from Mexico, and as far as we understand it, the young man known as 25-year-old Diego Tzaj Ixtos is still alive,” Chox said to the camera, first in Spanish and then repeating everything in K'iche. “This is the good news we have for you today.” Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had called the blaze “an unfortunate accident” before later vowing that the perpetrators – including the migrant who lit the fire, the guards and his top-ranking immigration Cabinet minister – would be held to account. The Mexican government also reported some men as dead who were still alive. But the parents of Diego Tzaj Ixtos, given momentary hope, would soon learn their son, too, was dead. Sitting on her porch beside her husband in a torrential rainstorm, Tambriz Tambriz remembered how she begged her son not to go. “I told him, ‘I can’t tell you what to do,’” Tambriz Tambriz said in K'iche as Chox translated. “I told him, ‘If you want to stay and get married, I will support you.’ He said, ‘No mamá, I don’t want to get married right now. I want to go in search of a better life.’"" Like Cuc, Tambriz Tambriz had few physical memories of her son to hold on to. There was a single framed photograph of him standing tall in a soccer field, good-looking and strong. He ""was a good boy, humble,"" she said. If he dreamed of going north to the U.S., he never talked about it, she said. But a sign he harbored an American dream was still standing in the corner of his dirt-floor room: a cabinet he had painted red, white and blue like the U.S. flag. The abundant natural beauty of La Ceiba exists alongside poverty like poles of a magnet: the pull of home, the push of hunger. Work is scarce; jobs that pay more than a subsistence wage, nonexistent. The need to help the family survive drove Tziquin Cuc, Tzaj Ixtos and the other young men to quit school early, their parents said, and help their fathers in the fields, harvesting corn or bananas. The nearest health clinic is nearly an hour away. If municipal or state governments reach the villages at all, they don't pick up the trash. Picturesque forest trails are littered with garbage: plastic soda bottles and chip bags, candy wrappers and foam cups. Along the volcano's slopes, people build their houses of block and wood planks, single story, with outhouses and wide porches to keep the rain from blowing in the entrances. The men chop wood, and the women cook over an open fire. Migration can be measured in houses, Chox said: Those with glass windows and front doors, tiled floors and second stories are almost always built with U.S. dollars sent home. A home next door to Cuc's cottage – the one with the gray stucco facade and fancy doorknob – stood like a lighthouse on a shore, a beacon of what is possible for those who survive the journey to the United States. When the young men of La Ceiba decided to head north, the U.S. was facing historically high levels of migration at the Southwest border. Tens of thousands of people were lawfully turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents, to seek asylum or refuge, at the Southwest border every week while others were attempting to sneak in illegally. Juárez in March was as diverse as a New York City neighborhood: People from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti and Cuba were filling up shelters and encampments, looking for day jobs or begging on street corners, awaiting their chance to seek asylum at the U.S. border fence in El Paso. U.S. Border Patrol recorded more than 250,000 migrant encounters in March, including more than 40,000 in the El Paso-Juárez corridor. The Biden administration’s behind-the-scenes pressure on Mexico to slow the flow of migrants north intensified. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had ordered National Guard soldiers to unfurl coils of razor wire in the river bed, adding to the tension. The El Paso mayor had declared a state of emergency amid the humanitarian crisis, while the Juárez mayor was instructing police to dismantle migrant encampments. Those actions led to a more fortified border, and migrants were marked as targets, advocates said. In this context, Mexico's National Migration Institute, known as INAMI, and national guard increased its operations at the northern border. The authorities stopped charter buses at a military checkpoint about 20 miles south of the U.S. border, in the desert outskirts of Juárez. On the last weekend in March, Mexico’s National Migration Institute coordinated a surprise roundup of migrants in Juárez, arresting — the agency uses the word ""rescuing"" — dozens of people on street corners and at the military checkpoint. Tziquin Cuc, Tzaj Ixtos and at least three other young men from Sololá were taken to a detention center. The cells were hidden out of sight behind immigration offices at the foot of the Stanton-Lerdo international bridge connecting El Paso and Juárez. The Guatemalans were padlocked in a cell: 68 men in total. Only 28 men would survive. Magdalena Tziquin Cuc lives across a cobblestoned street from her mother, Juana Cuc. When her little brother left for the U.S., so did her own youngest son, 20-year-old Gaspar Josué Cuc Tziquin. They made the trip together. The night of the fire, neighbors visited Magdalena Tziquin Cuc, too: Her son was dead. Months later, she won’t speak of his death. He came home to her like the others did, by airplane in a casket. She refused to attend his burial. She won't visit his grave or the grave of her youngest brother, laid to rest beside her son. She tends a candlelit altar in her son's old room at home. Their graves face one another, in a cemetery a five-minute walk from the young men's homes. Cuc Tziquin's grave is tiled in gray and marked with a passage from the Bible: ""He who believes in Me, though he may die, shall live."" Marcos Abdon Tziquin Cuc's grave is tiled in black and white. Overgrown brush 6 feet tall swallows their tombs. Cuc visits her son's grave. ""My son told me, 'Mamá, I want to go to the United States. I'm grown and my whole life is ahead of me,'"" Cuc said, her voice cracking through tears that became sobs. ""I remember he told me, 'When I get there, I can send you some money and give you a home. It's my turn to give to you.'""",10161,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/12/04/cd-juarez-fire-killed-five-la-ceiba-guatemala/71799574007/,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2023/11/11/PTX1/71539636007-marcos-family-gautemala-12538.jpg?crop=5114,3838,x315,y0?width=320&height=240",International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,today patrol believe sunday feed living ceiba stucco flow lighthouse link village tragedy country plant emergency week border crisscross anchor culture marked make clinic smile advocate angeles earlier talk weekend seek agent rain administration asylum wood chop image manuel worry live account trickle volcano magdalena fail inhumane passage northern fence colombia bed brush military thousand room institute andrés shore camera sight hard blaze await dream mother photo candlelight torrential quemá soccer overgrown neighbor nonexistent bore razor lit inside honduras birthday dismantle mexico online diego reach entrance eye neatly nineteen translate school boy authority police memory hidden rest left high intensified stovetop red illegally work join fire policy outhouse father hold hundred roundup state francisco slow safe world told coordinate exists shed news gear humble diaspora paint measure remember middle coil list charter put attend half hunger illuminate result encampment texas cold fortify garbage mamá hit harvest tomb harbor migrant call photograph biden foot give crack context married beacon tension husband migration immigration international front cobblestone venezuela grow cuc nation street home head center volunteer doorknob strong chip spent drove hour grave aldea bag ten money guatemalan corn sprinkle single grown slope add held town catarina open juárez death chopped atlanta month minister rainstorm walk méxico possible salvador chox brought parent pole perpetrator quit march search ecuador flag house caught brother year stand marcos audio subsistence skirt neighborhood declare family order level bridge concrete government journalist life momentary lead attempt fill pick young mayor operation unfurl pew send pecul dead laid transmit green detain glass felt blue hang report trash braid deem decide tall humanitarian cook bottle teacher lifeless couple alive juana homeland press learn cup guard refuse deeply cottage cry turn mayan woman elementary cell survive river build sign american tie chance pull missionary sob tear lock agency guatemala swallow free corridor inami picturesque instruct bus language united rural lópez hope soda speak suffocate casket support push stoic altar cuba stay neck south particular antonio bible forest plank beg mountain paso knew national trip kindle window cemetery heard health shelter stop burial unlock visit toll foam heavier target early vow surprise greg parking word field white floor crown journey gray total encounter pressure scarce pay haiti frame crisis trail buy unfortunate community ixtos checkpoint southwest outskirt happen abdon gov airplane reason mexican obrador chest amid alongside wire night story padlocked focus aluminum office beauty candlelit religion time poverty historically action stood warm increase dozen plastic directly lawfully connect stack repeat banana voice ahead north candy tziquin cheek black blowing celebrate president record sneak lush victim deadliest porch magnet relieve cabinet suv small summer gaspar built detention tambriz mile rise facebook rosary arrest municipal wage york abundant city blanket litter confusion sat spanish away church diverse understand day begin desert burden corner dollar physical pepper child josué attention cloud graf sololá abbott fancy soldier boyish body include wrapper smoke burn job block natural refuge investigate wide lot rescue ease accident tzaj steeple facade,-0.39655,0.1771479185119575,6.7266795366795336,0.369264911014911,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Israel’s military pushes into southern Gaza as danger for civilians mounts,2023-12-04 14:51:00,"Kareem Fahim, Miriam Berger","AMMAN, Jordan — Dozens of Israeli military vehicles have crossed into southern Gaza, new satellite imagery showed Monday, signaling the long-expected beginning of a new phase of Israel’s war against Hamas in the densely populated enclave.Witnesses said that Israel established a new checkpoint outside the key city of Khan Younis as residents scrambled to stay clear of the advancing army, and a territory-wide communications blackout hampered the humanitarian response.A focal point of the operations Monday was Gaza’s Salah al-Din Road, which Israel had previously designated as an evacuation route for civilians fleeing from the north to the south. The Israel Defense Forces, for the first time, announced Monday that a segment of the road, north of Khan Younis, was a “battlefield” and that residents should no longer approach it.The IDF identified “bypass” roads it said residents should travel on instead, adding to the thicket of evacuation orders Israel has issued in recent days that it says are aimed at reducing civilian casualties. But aid groups have warned the directives are becoming impossible to navigate, while Palestinians in Gaza say the guidance is of little use in a place where most everywhere is filled with peril.Late on Monday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said that it had lost contact with its medical teams in Gaza, after the main telephone and internet provider, Paltel, said all telecommunications services were cut.“The level of human suffering is intolerable,” Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said in a statement Monday as she visited Gaza. “It is unacceptable that civilians have no safe place to go in Gaza, and with a military siege in place there is also no adequate humanitarian response currently possible.”Since a week-long humanitarian pause ended Friday, with Hamas and Israel blaming each other for its collapse, Israel has “entered a new phase in our war against Hamas,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said Monday.“We pursued them in northern Gaza; we are now pursuing them in southern Gaza, too,” Hagari said in a recorded press statement. “We will operate in maximum force against Hamas terrorists and infrastructure while minimizing harm to the civilians that Hamas places around them as shields.”Separately, the Israeli army announced in a statement Monday that it had targeted hundreds of locations in Gaza by ground, air and sea, including a weapons storage facility and a vehicle containing mortar shells, missiles and other weapons. The statement did not say when the strikes occurred.Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since Friday, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which said Monday that at least 15,899 people had been killed since Oct. 7, when Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel that killed at least 1,200 people.Despite the growing death toll, the White House said Monday that it was “too soon” to judge whether Israel was doing enough to limit civilian casualties as its forces pushed into southern Gaza.“Over the course of the weekend, we’ve seen basically 48 to 72 hours of activity. So it’s too soon for me to sit here and tell you that I’m going to pass some comprehensive judgment,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at a briefing Monday.But as the fighting intensified across Gaza, the dangers for civilians accumulated, including along Salah al-Din Road, the main thoroughfare linking the northern and southern parts of the enclave.Intense shelling in the area started Friday, soon after the pause ended, according to Hani Abu Mustafa, 39, who lives near the road north of Khan Younis. “We were being bombed in such a devastating and frightening way by F-16 planes that we thought it would be our last night,” he said.By Saturday morning, large numbers of residents were fleeing, after the Israeli military dropped leaflets warning them to evacuate, he said.Abu Mustafa’s family had been loath to leave. They stayed in their house throughout the last few weeks, wary of the “bitterness” that awaited them in evacuation shelters, he said. They only left their home, he added, when he saw Israeli tanks with his own eyes on Saturday morning.“We did not have time to carry any of our personal belongings,” he said. On Sunday, he said, “We received news from neighbors who live near our house that the army had turned it into a military barracks, and was shooting at passersby on Salah al-Din Street.”Witnesses said Monday that Israel had established a checkpoint at the intersection of Al-Matahen and Salah al-Din streets. Israeli forces previously operated a checkpoint in the same area when they occupied Gaza before withdrawing in 2005.Satellite images, taken Sunday by Planet Labs, show vehicle tracks beginning at the Gaza-Israel border and continuing about 2.5 miles west into the Strip. The tracks end shortly after cutting Salah al-Din Road.The vehicles are parked about 1.7 miles north of the municipal boundary of Khan Younis, the largest city in Gaza’s south and now home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by Israel’s invasion in the north.Sondos Daloul, 25, who is staying in a school with her family on Salah al-Din Road in the Deir al-Balah area, said tanks had taken up positions in the area over the last few days. Artillery shelling had wounded people sheltering there, she said.More than 80 percent of Gaza’s population has already been displaced, according to figures released Monday by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. Overcrowded homes, hospitals, shelters and tent camps have also helped spread disease and conditions such as diarrhea and skin infections, the United Nations says.Israeli forces “have actually taken the quite unusual step for a modern military and identified precisely the area that they intend to have ground maneuver,” Sullivan said of the evacuation notices. “And they have asked the people in that area to move out.”But the instructions issued Monday did not give specific directions for civilians heading south from Gaza City and northern Gaza, areas that Israeli forces largely cut off since launching ground operations in late October.Nir Dinar, an IDF spokesman, said Monday that “there is still an open corridor from the north to the south” along Gaza’s coastal road, west of Salah al-Din, which he said was open Monday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.He said civilians were notified of the route through recordings, leaflets and text messages, but added that no recordings were issued Monday and did not immediately respond to a request for copies of text messages and leaflets.Muhammad al-Natour, 42, a displaced Gazan who is staying north of Khan Younis near Salah al-Din Road, said he received Israeli evacuation notices: a call to the owner of the house where he was staying, demanding they leave, and leaflets dropped from planes, telling them to go to Rafah, on the border with Egypt.His family complied with the evacuation orders, moving west, away from the army. “If military operations extend to this area, we may suddenly be displaced for a third time,” he said.",7164,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/04/israel-gaza-war-south-khan-younis/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,mirjana sunday sullivan younis deir link owner humanitarian rear strip week border large shortly team hospital ministry modern press missile thicket notice cut facility operate contact turn occupy weekend continue hani satellite telecommunication park image instruction wary live number battlefield signal pursue briefing suddenly idf northern disease agency respond morning receive military corridor thousand infrastructure army spokesman evacuate message palestinian security evacuation service await separately unrwa united approach coastal passersby aid point specific neighbor medical tent mortar push wound reporter internet gazan stay abu maneuver response south area siege maximum daniel eye populate diarrhea national activity cross thoroughfare force paltel school resident health group shelter track tank left skin intensified visit daloul toll red part release shoot camp target unusual kill accumulate intolerable ground position loath key hundred white leave currently move previously safe defense told guidance copy news hagari show dinar bombed statement enter strike road travel invasion intersection gaza start checkpoint danger figure carry monday launch unacceptable southern judgment focal frighten civilian provider hamper weapon clear call comply devastate night advance announce condition amman terrorist longer give time salah drop khan dozen judge notify basically jake late international palestine crescent blackout grow contain mustafa comprehensive adequate street home directive nation head hamas imagery scramble barrack artillery north demand extend belonging densely recording president step plane hour issue record friday navigate personal telephone boundary add spoljaric largely open planet israeli death deadly refugee infection mile request immediately reduce municipal communication bitterness establish flee human city designate place accord egger away percent west jordan house location limit storage day lab pause begin rafah precisely segment attack air family harm casualty leaflet overcrowd stayed order committee level blame phase identify include direction collapse instead life text society fight bypass witness vehicle spread fill course aim warn israel operation suffer shell adviser population displace saturday recent lose impossible intend minimize route withdraw,-0.9963,0.2931323283082077,10.55068078668684,0.3460405448210327,0,2023-12-04
Reuters,Israel investigates possible trading knowledge ahead of Oct 7 Hamas attack,2023-12-04 14:14:00,Steven Scheer,"JERUSALEM, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Israeli authorities are investigating claims by U.S. researchers that some investors may have known in advance of a Hamas plan to attack Israel on Oct. 7 and used that information to profit from Israeli securities.Research by law professors Robert Jackson Jr from New York University and Joshua Mitts of Columbia University found significant short-selling of shares leading up to the attacks, which triggered a war nearly two months old.""Days before the attack, traders appeared to anticipate the events to come,"" they wrote, citing short interest in the MSCI Israel Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that ""suddenly, and significantly, spiked"" on Oct. 2 based on data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).""And just before the attack, short selling of Israeli securities on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) increased dramatically,"" they wrote in their 66-page report.In response, the TASE referred Reuters to the Israel Securities Authority, which said: ""The matter is known to the authority and is under investigation by all the relevant parties.""A spokeswoman for the securities regulator did not elaborate, and Israeli police did not immediately comment.The researchers said short-selling, in which investors expect the share price to fall, allowing it to be bought back at a lower price at a profit, prior to Oct. 7 ""exceeded the short- selling that occurred during numerous other periods of crisis.""That includes the recession following the financial crisis in 2008, the 2014 Israel-Gaza war, and the COVID-19 pandemic.They wrote that for Leumi (LUMI.TA), Israel's largest bank, 4.43 million new shares sold short over the Sept. 14 to Oct. 5 period yielded profits of 3.2 billion shekels ($862 million) on that additional short-selling.""Although we see no aggregate increase in shorting of Israeli companies on U.S. exchanges, we do identify a sharp and unusual increase, just before the attacks, in trading in risky short-dated options on these companies expiring just after the attacks,"" they said.""Our findings suggest that traders informed about the coming attacks profited from these tragic events, and consistent with prior literature we show that trading of this kind occurs in gaps in U.S. and international enforcement of legal prohibitions on informed trading.""The professors referred to patterns in early April when it was reported that Hamas was initially planning its attack on Israel. ""Short volume in EIS (the MSCI Israel ETF) peaked on April 3 at levels very similar to those observed on Oct. 2, and was far higher by an order of magnitude than other days prior to April 3,"" they said.",2649,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-investigates-possible-trading-knowledge-ahead-oct-7-hamas-attack-2023-12-04/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/F5YQTNALEZIRHCOO4R5A46VSJA.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,joshua exchange prior base hamas trigger large trade anticipate literature profit regulator jerusalem additional aggregate april relevant sharp yield unusual exceed trader consistent bought stock authority refer robert security crisis share similar fund significantly expire write back response event planning finra advance eis lead prohibition recession israel regulatory suggest suddenly sell police early option expect law kind identify pattern shekel high elaborate israeli inform international investor report msci occur jackson data industry bank gap significant low dramatically investigate immediately party company volume jr trading fall magnitude plan observe peaked price aviv information tase matter reuters researcher york tragic short day million month spike show occurs tel dec finding initially investigation enforcement spokeswoman follow financial university numerous include professor level columbia increase attack risky order legal found claim period etf billion leumi interest,-0.1032,0.3397508493771234,10.60244399185336,0.4077525252525252,0,2023-12-04
USA TODAY,'Nowhere safe to go': Israel ground forces poised to strike in south Gaza: Live updates,2023-12-04 14:03:39,"John Bacon, Jorge L. Ortiz","Israeli ground forces brought their pursuit of Hamas militants into southern Gaza on Monday, as civilians already unnerved by repeated airstrikes were left with diminishing options for finding safety. Tanks, armored vehicles and troops were posted just outside the southern city of Khan Younis, whose outskirts were subjected to heavy bombardment earlier in the day. Israel had told Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, to head south toward the border town of Rafah to avoid getting caught in the anticipated combat. That led to massive displacement, in many cases of the same people who had fled the battered north, further deteriorating the enclave’s humanitarian crisis. The evacuation area represented about one-fifth of Khan Younis, whose pre-war population of 117,000 has swelled during the conflict. ""For people ordered to evacuate, there is nowhere safe to go and very little to survive on,"" U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Thomas White, director of the U.N. agency for Palestinian aid known as UNRWA, described roads heading south jammed with people carrying what little they have in cars and carts pulled by donkeys. “Even in Rafah where people are being forced to flee the sound of airstrikes punctuates the day,” White said in a post on the X platform. “People are pleading for advice on where to find safety. We have nothing to tell them.” The Israeli military said its aircraft struck about 200 Hamas targets in Gaza overnight, and ground troops were operating in parallel. Reuters reported an airstrike in Rafah left a crater the size of a basketball court, killing a toddler. “We were asleep and safe,” said Salah al-Arja, one of the homeowners whose house was destroyed. “They tell you it is a safe area, but there is no safe area in all of the Gaza Strip.” Bombing resumes: Israel expands ground offensive in Gaza Developments: ∎ Phone and internet service was again down across Gaza on Monday evening, Palestinian telecom provider PalTel reported, keeping residents largely incommunicado from the outside world. ∎ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet Tuesday with families of hostages held in Gaza, who are seeking more information about efforts to free their loved ones after negotiations for further releases of captives broke down. ∎ Netanyahu's corruption trial, which began in 2020 and was put on hold after the Oct. 7 attacks, resumed Monday. He faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. ∎ CNN said at least nine family members of its producer Ibrahim Dahman were killed by an Israeli airstrike on his aunt’s northern Gaza house Sunday. Dahman, 36, had evacuated his young family to Egypt but his childhood home in Gaza City was destroyed by another strike the same day. ∎ Thousands of Israelis attended the funeral for Col. Asaf Hamami, 41, the commander of the Gaza Division’s Southern Brigade, even though his remains are being held by Hamas in Gaza. Hamami was killed during the Oct. 7 Hamas assault on Israel. The White House said again Monday that a weeklong cease-fire between Israel and Hamas ended because the Palestinian militant group failed to deliver hostages who should have been released. “Hamas is refusing to release civilian women who should have been part of the agreement,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. “And it is that refusal by Hamas that has caused the end of the hostage agreement, and therefore the end of the pause in hostilities.” Israel resumed its assault on the Gaza Strip on Friday after the release of more than 100 hostages held by Hamas, in exchange for Israel freeing 240 prisoners. Israel said Hamas ""violated"" the cease-fire and fired toward Israel. Hamas officials blamed the Israelis, saying they turned down offers to release elderly captives as well as the bodies of hostages. − Michael Collins Evidence aimed at proving Hamas committed crimes of sexual violence during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel was presented at a U.N. meeting hosted Monday by the Israeli ambassador to the global body. Gilad Erdan said the U.N. and its organizations ""completely ignored for almost 60 days and still cast doubt"" on the assaults. The evidence includes reports from first responders at the sites where militants struck and from military reservists who worked to identify the bodies of those killed, Erdan said. Hamas issued a statement denying its militants committed sexual assaults, dismissing the claims as an effort to distort the Palestinian resistance and the ""humane and moral dealings with detainees"" militants have shown. ""The world has to decide who to believe,"" said Sheryl Sandberg, former Meta CEO and founder of the nonprofit group Lean In. ""Do we believe the Hamas spokesperson who said rape is forbidden, therefore it couldn't possibly have happened on Oct. 7? Or do we believe the women whose bodies tell us how they spent the last minutes of their lives?"" Sandberg told the gathering that ""rape should never be used as an act of war"" and that ""silence is complicity."" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said last week that the reports of sexual assault ""must be vigorously investigated."" The Israeli military tacitly confirmed Monday the Gaza Health Ministry's death tally, which has been questioned by many including President Joe Biden, by saying at least 15,000 Palestinians in Gaza have died during the war. The ministry's updated figure Monday was 15,899, not far from the estimate by Israel, which says 5,000 of the fatalities involved Hamas militants. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Its spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said women and children account for 70% of those killed. Though the ministry is under Hamas rule, its death tolls from previous wars have stood up to scrutiny, and humanitarian agencies regard them as reliable. But as the fatality count in Gaza rose to alarming levels, the numbers were questioned by Israeli officials and even Biden, who on Oct. 25 said, ""I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.” Hamas may have profited from stock deals that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in profits for traders who short-sold some Israeli issues in advance of Hamas's brutal Oct. 7 attack. ""Trading on Terror?"" a study led by two American researchers, says the traders may have known the attack was coming and would drive some Israeli stocks sharply lower. The report, published in the SSRN journal by Robert Jackson Jr. from New York University and Joshua Mitts of Columbia, does not mention Hamas but found that some traders with advance knowledge may have made hundreds of millions of dollars. ""Our findings suggest that traders informed about the coming attacks profited from these tragic events,"" the study says. ""We do identify a sharp and unusual increase, just before the attacks, in trading in risky short-dated options on these companies."" Shorting a stock involves investing with the expectation a stock will decline in value. The Israel Securities Authority told Reuters the issue ""is known to the authority and is under investigation by all the relevant parties."" The USS Carney responded to attacks against commercial ships and shot down three drones over the Red Sea on Sunday, but the warship may not have been a target of the hostilities, the Pentagon says. The Carney was on patrol in the Red Sea when it responded to distress calls, the Pentagon said in a statement issued late Sunday. The warship detected an anti-ship ballistic missile attack fired from Houthi controlled areas of Yemen toward Unity Explorer, a Bahamas-flagged, U.K.-owned and operated bulk cargo ship crewed by sailors from two nations. The Carney shot down a drone launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen that appeared headed toward the warship ""although its specific target is not clear,'' the Pentagon said. ""We cannot assess at this time whether the Carney was a target of the UAVs."" The incident comes after Israel resumed bombardment of the Gaza Strip following a weeklong truce with Hamas, whose vicious Oct. 7 border attack on Israeli communities sparked the war. Israeli forces, which had been pounding northern Gaza, are now intensifying their efforts in southern Gaza as well. ""We are determined to continue to fight, dismantle Hamas, and bring all the hostages home,"" said Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. There was no damage or injuries reported on the Carney, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The Pentagon initially described the incident as an attack on the Carney before providing more details. The Houthis claimed responsibility for assaults on commercial ships they believed were linked to Israel but made no mention of the U.S. warship.

Reuters,European countries tighten borders,2023-12-04 13:47:00,not specified,"Dec 4 (Reuters) - The European Union is dealing with an increase in legal and illegal arrivals by migrants, prompting some member states to temporarily re-introduce border controls within what is normally a zone of free movement.The bloc's Schengen rules allow such action ""as a last resort"" in cases that are deemed serious threats to internal security or public policy.These countries have reinstated stricter checks:* Austria introduced checks at its border with the Czech Republic in October, set to last until Dec. 6.As of November, it extended border controls with Slovenia and Hungary until May 2024, citing pressure on the asylum reception system, threats of arms trafficking, criminal networks linked to the war in Ukraine, and people smuggling.* Denmark in August tightened border control for arrivals, including those from Schengen countries, at Copenhagen airport to boost security after incidents of Koran burnings.It has prolonged checks on the Danish-German land border and in ports with ferry connections to Germany until May 2024, according to an EU commission report.The government said it was responding to an increase in irregular migration, and cited threats posed by terrorism and organised crime, foreign intelligence espionage and the war in Ukraine.* France as of November reintroduced controls on its borders with Schengen countries, citing what it called terrorism threats. The controls should last until April 30, 2024.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin had announced reinforced security in October at the Belgian border after the killing of two people by an assailant in Brussels.* Germany announced controls in September on its land borders with Poland, the Czech Republic and Switzerland, set to stay in place until Dec. 4. Berlin said it needed to respond to an immigration surge and high levels of smuggling.Germany, which has Europe's biggest economy, has seen a sharp increase of first-time asylum requests this year.Berlin has also extended land border checks with Austria until May 2024, saying this was in response to what it called a strain on its asylum reception system, security threats linked to Middle East terrorism, and the war in Ukraine.* Italy reinstated police checks at its northeast land border with Slovenia as of Oct. 21, saying some migrants in transit on the Balkan route could be terrorists.The controls will be in place at least until Dec. 9. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said in October they would likely be extended into next year.* Norway, which belongs to the Schengen arrangement but is not an EU member, reinstated border controls in its ports with ferry connections to the Schengen area as of Nov. 12. It pointed to threats to its on-shore and off-shore infrastructure, and from foreign intelligence services.These controls should last until May 5, 2024.* Poland has extended temporary controls on its border with Slovakia until Dec. 3, pointing to migrants' efforts to illegally enter from there.The government was rocked by a ""visas for cash"" scandal earlier this year, when the opposition accused it of being complicit in a system where people received visas at an accelerated pace without proper checks after paying intermediaries.* Slovakia on Nov. 20 approved keeping temporary controls on its border with Hungary until Dec. 23. The government is seeking to limit the number of illegal arrivals, having said in November that it detained roughly 500% more migrants who arrived illegally this year compared to 2022.* Slovenia on Nov. 17 extended border controls with Schengen members until Dec. 9. The government cited armed conflict in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa, and elevated threats from organised crime and terrorism.It also plans to re-introduce controls on those borders for six months, from Dec. 22.In October, Slovenia had deployed police on border crossings with Croatia and Hungary.* Sweden strengthened checks on its borders in August, giving border police more power including body searches and increased use of electronic surveillance.The same month, the government raised Sweden's terrorism threat level, saying it had thwarted attacks after Koran burnings triggered threats from Islamist militants.As of November, it extended the border checks until May 2024.* Finland on Nov. 30 closed its entire border with Russia to travellers until Dec. 13, after more than 900 asylum seekers arrived at different border stations throughout November.",4437,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/european-countries-tighten-borders-2023-11-24/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/OZ2F5QCFU5NHHOHBKNLHDZMTRQ.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,economy middle incident traffic terrorism denmark asylum control organise request visa trigger enter hungary action temporarily boost ferry poland april port big body stay state crime sharp number accuse arm airport august africa public northeast different koran foreign criminal place slovenia seek security accelerate introduce cash bloc october commission call switzerland prompt response czech slovakia extend illegally rock receive berlin pay austria migration power croatia raise seeker year rule police opposition approve pressure member immigration islamist irregular tighten temporary conflict germany high surge italy search union area elevate intermediary interior case roughly earlier proper compare schengen country reception thwart ukraine norway deal announce give close russia detain finland resort infrastructure electronic copenhagen european strain smuggle plan connection point gerald reinforce burning link land transit pace illegal set entire kill border minister reuters september republic system network europe brussels sweden reinstate complicit month check arrive prolong government arrival respond dec route threat assailant piantedosi france november arrangement traveller balkan deem belgian migrant internal effort zone station intelligence stricter include pose increase level reintroduce east attack espionage legal darmanin matteo strengthen accord belongs crossing limit free deployed scandal,-0.9845,0.3380662609871535,12.315306388526729,0.3429729729729729,0,2023-12-04

Reuters,First empty lorries pass through new Ukraine crossing at Polish border,2023-12-04 12:38:00,Pavel Polityuk,"KYIV, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The first 30 empty lorries drove through a newly opened Uhryniv-Dolhobychuv crossing on the Ukrainian-Polish border, which Kyiv hopes will offer relief as Polish driver protests blocked other land corridors, Ukraine's border service said on Monday.Those protests, over what Polish truckers see as unfair competition from their Ukrainian peers, started on Nov. 6, with four border crossings now under blockade.Polish hauliers' main demand is to stop Ukrainian truckers having permit-free access to the European Union, something that Kyiv and Brussels say is impossible.Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Monday that Warsaw would ""strongly and unequivocally"" demand that the European Union restore permits for Ukrainian truckers.He was speaking to reporters ahead of an EU ministers' meeting in Brussels set for Monday.Poland, Slovakia and Hungary said their delegations would inform the EU about the impact of the EU-Ukraine agreement to remove permits on the road freight sector.The permits were abolished after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. Polish drivers have been joined by Polish farmers, and later also Slovakian truckers.Ukraine said last week it had agreed some measures with Poland that could ease the pressure at the blockaded border crossings, but that the main demands of the protests had not been discussed.Free passage of empty Polish lorries across the border was one of the demands that Ukraine can meet.""As of the morning of December 4, border guards cleared 30 heavy vehicles with a total permissible weight of more than 7.5 (metric) tons for departure from Ukraine at the Uhryniv checkpoint,"" the service said on Telegram messaging app.The crossing was opened at 1.00 a.m. (midnight GMT) on Monday for empty trucks.""The ultimate goal of the work is to unblock the border, which has been blocked for a month on the Polish side and has critical consequences for the economies of both countries and the European market,"", Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on the X social media platform on Sunday.A senior Ukrainian official last week said protests on the border could cost Kyiv one percentage point of GDP growth if they drag on.",2217,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/first-lorries-pass-through-new-ukraine-crossing-polish-border-2023-12-04/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QX2KL3RELRN4DCZ5JAIJNH47NQ.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,economy competition checkpoint measure prime medium stop kubrakov hungary social delegation poland cost morning newly vehicle invasion meeting goal restore reporter x unblock permit demand heavy polish oleksandr consequence lorry ukrainian ahead impact ultimate telegram slovakia official growth empty farmer drove message meet year platform percentage service offer pressure warsaw agreement unequivocally access union gdp strongly inform block abolish total midnight country ukraine senior freight monday side russia gmt clear permissible ease critical relief european point road guard land week metric slovakian set border minister reuters corridor brussels month start speak hope haulier kyiv dec deputy agree departure peer uhryniv december market trucker join weight work open driver protest mateusz truck remove unfair drag passage crossing morawiecki blockade cross,-0.0317999999999999,0.0,12.559376623376622,0.3729324494949495,0,2023-12-04

Reuters,"With UK climate credentials in doubt, Starmer in demand at COP28",2023-12-04 12:16:00,"Elizabeth Piper, Kate Abnett","DUBAI, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Britain's opposition leader Keir Starmer was in his element as he rubbed shoulders with world leaders at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, almost as if in rehearsal for the role of prime minister he hopes will soon be his.During a two-day visit to the Gulf, the Labour Party leader held meetings on climate change and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza with leaders including the Emir of Qatar, the King of Jordan and the president of Brazil. He had chats with U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.Attending a roundtable of investors with more than $2 trillion of assets under management, Starmer also took the chance to discuss his growth plans for Britain, his office said.It is not unusual for opposition leaders to receive summit invitations, but COP28 is particularly resonant. Before a British election expected next year, politicians are balancing the importance of tackling climate change, with the enormous investments associated with shifting to a greener economy.The tensions found a flashpoint in attempts to reduce vehicle emissions in London and in September, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak weakened some domestic CO2-cutting policies.Starmer, who is 20-points ahead in the opinion polls, outlasted Sunak by a day at COP28, where he pledged to make Britain ""stand tall in the world"" and undo the dithering and climate damage he said the government had inflicted.""While the Conservatives use it (net zero) to appease their party and sow political division, my Labour government will harness it in the national interest, to turbocharge growth,"" he said in a statement.Sunak meanwhile found himself asked at a news conference whether other leaders at COP28 had questioned his decision to water down domestic green measures, such as the ban on sales of new petrol cars.""Not a single leader that I've spoken to today has spoken about that. Do you know why? Because most of their targets are less ambitious than the UK's,"" Sunak said.The response was at odds with comments from some governments.Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said his government was ""somewhat worried"" by the UK's move, and hoped it was only ""a flirt with populist sentiments"".""To think that you're doing your public a favour by moving away from strict climate goals is actually wrong,"" he said, citing growing demand for low-emissions products and the opportunity for job creation.Ireland's climate minister, Eamon Ryan, hailed Britain's climate leadership, but also said Sunak's reset of some measures had not gone down well when the news was reported while he was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly.Britain's development minister Andrew Mitchell, at COP28, told Reuters what Sunak did ""was very good government"".""He was saying, we're going to hit these (net zero) targets anyway, and therefore we can rein back a bit on the costs for ordinary people. I think that's extremely honourable.""Sunak has also drawn criticism from Labour and some in his own party after his cancellation last week of a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis over ownership of the Parthenon sculptures.Sunak's team said the Greek leader had broken a promise not to use the meeting to advocate for the return of the sculptures, known in Britain as the Elgin Marbles, from the British Museum.But the Conservatives' former finance minister George Osborne questioned whether Sunak had been angered that Kitsotakis had met Starmer before him.""Is it just petulance? Is it just having a bit of a hissy fit?"" he asked on his podcast.",3564,https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/with-uk-climate-credentials-doubt-starmer-demand-cop28-2023-12-04/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/W3GPMTPSCJOYXANQX4MQTNICKM.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,sentiment flirt element reduce net national prime water dither john cost visit emission target unusual stand strict change meeting populist goal return public comment foreign held uk turbocharge rubbed attempt grow secretary domestic hit back ban make ryan rein odds leader growth wrong greek kyriakos political single espen conservative expect podcast shoulder product sunak petulance pledge advocate kerry greener role barth eide roundtable criticism plan week green leadership mitsotakis emir cancellation minister elgin summit york hissy day management jordan government today office bit president eamon general outlast news world ambitious harness gulf king kitsotakis mitchell found sculpture measure car question brazil conference damage worried vehicle associate angered weaken enormous rishi away andrew opportunity investment demand inflict division envoy ahead development british response rehearsal labour tall receive dubai gaza zero ownership broken year opposition undo extremely finance move drawn importance team politician investor discus report asset reset spoken party resonant job ordinary particularly chance promise chat invitation poll sow decision opinion parthenon marble qatar reuters september petrol osborne hope flashpoint tension appease dec antonio climate hail trillion honourable keir hop britain fit include told starmer former election favour shift tackle george london balance interest,0.8443499999999999,0.0841750841750841,10.252247360482649,0.3741544698687556,0,2023-12-04

CNN,CNN Gaza reporter’s relatives killed and childhood home destroyed in two separate strikes,2023-12-04 11:40:00,Helen Regan,"For weeks, CNN producer Ibrahim Dahman reported from Gaza as Israeli airstrikes brought devastation and despair to the besieged strip in the wake of the Hamas terror attacks of October 7.Dahman, 36, escaped to Egypt with his young family after nearly a month, but on Sunday he heard news that at least nine relatives trapped in northern Gaza had been killed in a strike on his aunt’s house.His childhood home in Gaza City was obliterated in a separate strike on an adjacent building the same day.“I will never be able to forget every stone and corner of the house in which I was born and raised and in which my children were born,” he said.Sunday will forever be remembered as a dark day for the Dahman family, after messages began pouring in on their messaging group that an Israeli strike had directly hit the building where his relatives were living in Beit Lahia, killing his uncle, and the uncle’s wife, daughter and two grandchildren, as well as his aunt, her husband and two children. At least two other relatives are in critical condition, and still others are still buried under the rubble.“They were extremely peaceful and simple people, and their entire lives were devoted solely to work and raising their sons and daughters,” Dahman said. “They have no affiliation with any organization or group… Pray to God to have mercy on them all.”Video posted on social media shows the aftermath of the blast that killed Dahman’s relatives. Smoke can be seen rising from the destroyed building, which has been reduced to a pile of concrete slabs and twisted metal. Debris is strewn across the street.Just two days ago, Dahman’s uncle, who used to work in Israel, relocated with his family to his sister’s house from their home in the Sheik Zayed area of northern Gaza, after the bombing intensified there. Dahman’s aunt was suffering from chronic cancer at the time.Just before learning of the devastating deaths of his family, Dahman’s brother had called to tell him that his home in Gaza City, which he was born and grew up in, was in ruins.Dahman had finished renovating the apartment, in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood of Gaza City, just three months before October 7, and no one was there when the bombardment began.He has happy memories from a life lived there, of celebrating his sons’ birthdays with cake and candles surrounded by family.“Unfortunately, I left all my memories, my belongings, and the gifts that my bosses sent me at work in this house, all of which were lost under the rubble now.”Dahman’s story is a reminder that no one in Gaza has been left untouched by the war.Israel’s bombing and military campaign in Gaza came following Hamas’ deadly October 7 terror attack which killed some 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilian, and saw more than 240 hostages seized.Since then Israeli has turned much of the strip into a wasteland. The airstrikes have reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and about 1.8 million people – 80% of Gaza’s population – have been forced to flee their homes, according to the UN.In almost two months of war, most people in Gaza have been just trying to survive, focusing on the basics of finding shelter, fleeing the fighting, and getting access to food and water.Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed about 15,200 Palestinians, including 6,000 children, since October 7, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which draws its figures from the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza.The seven-day pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas — which saw the release of some hostages from Hamas captivity and the release of 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails — gave many Gazans a brief respite from the constant bombing and time to buy supplies, if any were to be found.Almost immediately after truce broke down on Friday, the Israeli military restarted its aerial bombardment of Gaza, and on Sunday announced it was expanding its ground operations to the whole of the strip.Renewed strikes also hit the Jabalya refugee camp, in northern Gaza on Sunday, as seen in verified videos from the scene as well as in reporting by the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa.The Israeli military told civilians to leave large swaths of the strip, including number of neighborhoods in southern parts of the enclave, after it resumed its military offensive there.Dahman had previously detailed his desperate flight south to Khan Younis with his wife and two young sons, from their home in Gaza City in October. He described their ordeal of waking up to the sound of explosions for days, of being forced to move from place to place to keep his family safe from the strikes, and the struggles trying to find potable water to drink and food to eat for his young children and pregnant wife.Throughout it all he continued to report and film — to tell the world what was happening in Gaza.He described finally being able to cross the Rafah border to Egypt last month and the relief of settling in Cairo with his family. Though anxiety and worry continue to plague him as his parents and siblings remain trapped in Gaza.In the early days after his escape, Dahman had said he realized that “peace remains distant.”“I’ve covered many wars through the years. Nothing compares to the current conflict. Entire quarters in Gaza have been eviscerated, thousands of women, children and elderly have perished. What have civilians done to deserve this?” he said.“I am also haunted by our unknown fate: Where will we go from here? What is our future?”",5490,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/middleeast/gaza-cnn-producer-family-home-israel-airstrike-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190202234024-hamdi-alkhshali-profile-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,continued sunday living younis report relocate current draw solely food airstrikes strip daughter cnn trap social week border large organization sound ministry learn respite extremely entire detailed turn anxiety continue explosion desperate woman forever renovate survive sheik cairo remain god worry live number cake chronic eviscerate northern agency military ramallah egypt debris thousand message palestinian truce official dark boss realize remains million elderly verify slab wake radwan pile birthday sister captivity wife surround restart south despair area described terror quarter finally untouched cross conflict force critical swath heard zayed health group escape memory struggle shelter resume left perish intensified jail strewn part release devote camp work happy simple broke building aunt kill adjacent ordeal early ground candle wasteland aerial fate leave move previously safe world follow told news show strike rubble twist destroyed peace childhood buy gaza remember cover supply figure happen blast southern mercy pregnant civilian october bury forget hit call constant pray drink devastate cancer story announce focus peaceful condition besiege give time khan husband directly future access stone gazans grow finish eat find relative home compare hamas film post devastation bombing belonging basic unfortunately metal celebrate dahman friday ago apartment affiliation grandchild hostage lahia held aftermath israeli death deadly settle month refugee jabalya offensive rise immediately reduce sibling enclave ibrahim brought flee parent city place accord separate house video reminder obliterate brother water year day pause begin rafah unknown sheikh corner plague campaign child raise attack neighborhood beit family include haunt concrete smoke life bombardment potable fight producer deserve young gift israel operation suffer born medium flight uncle population expand scene lose reporting relief,-0.9939,0.4371584699453552,9.531072796934865,0.3691344246031745,0,2023-12-04
Reuters,India finds quality issues with cough syrup linked to Cameroon deaths - sources,2023-12-04 11:16:00,Shivam Patel,"BHOPAL, India, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Indian tests of a cough syrup linked to the deaths of at least six children in Cameroon have found unidentified quality issues in at least one of the five samples picked up by authorities, two people familiar with the investigation told Reuters.Riemann Labs is one of three Indian drugmakers whose cough syrups have been linked to the deaths of at least 141 children in Gambia, Uzbekistan and Cameroon since the middle of last year. That has cast a shadow on the quality of exports from India, often dubbed the ""world's pharmacy"" due to its supply of life-saving drugs at low prices to countries that most need them.The World Health Organization (WHO) said in July that a sample picked up from Cameroon of Naturcold syrup, whose maker India has identified as Riemann, contained as much 28.6% of the toxin of diethylene glycol, compared with an acceptable limit of no more than 0.10%.Indian authorities said they had suspended Riemann's production soon after the WHO alert, citing violations of good manufacturing practices.They also sent five Naturcold samples for tests, one of which has been found to be ""not of standard"" quality, said the sources who did not want to be named citing the sensitivity of the matter.They declined to say what were the issues with the sample before the company could respond to a notice sent to it.Riemann Labs and the drug regulator of Madhya Pradesh state, where the company is based, did not respond to queries from Reuters.An inspection at Riemann's factory by state and federal regulators in June had found violations including improper ventilation, raising the risk of cross contamination, the sources said.",1678,https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-finds-quality-issues-with-cough-syrup-linked-cameroon-deaths-sources-2023-12-04/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/GCT5PKTBXNLXHJSIZIGFSYYSDU.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,middle death base glycol issue export quality drugmakers regulator uzbekistan state inspection health bhopal maker improper june authority madhya acceptable alert standard supply india july sensitivity organization toxin cast cough raise shadow year indian contain identify manufacturing query compare country familiar low company syrup cameroon riemann notice link price risk dubbed picked reuters ventilation source unidentified contamination naturcold gambia respond dec pradesh investigation factory cross violation decline sample lab federal test world include told due diethylene suspend production found child pharmacy limit,-0.8383499999999999,0.0,10.744336569579286,0.3029761904761905,0,2023-12-04
MSNBC,A report that Israel knew about Hamas' plans adds pressure to Netanyahu,2023-12-04 11:00:00,Zeeshan Aleem,"The New York Times published a bombshell article Thursday that says Israeli military and intelligence officials had obtained a detailed blueprint for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks more than a year before the group carried them out. While it’s unclear if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was aware of the blueprint before the attack, the report is still the kind of revelation that’s likely to deal another blow to Netanyahu’s credibility as a defender of Israel — and further endanger his already precarious political future. According to the Times, the Hamas battle plan that Israel obtained in 2022 is outlined in a 40-page document that describes in great detail many of the strategies and tactics Hamas deployed on Oct. 7. The document includes plans for an initial burst of rockets to overwhelm and distract Israeli security forces, drone attacks on security cameras and automated border guns, incursions into Israel by motorcycle, paraglider and on foot, and plans to target and take over specific military bases. Hamas carried out all of those plans. The Israeli military and the Israeli Security Agency declined to comment on the matter to the Times; the Israeli military told the Associated Press that “Questions of this kind will be looked into in a later stage.” To put it lightly, this is all a bad look for the Israeli national security state. The document is even prefaced by a verse from the Quran that Hamas used in videos of the attack it released afterward. The Times also obtained emails showing that an Israeli intelligence analyst warned that a Hamas training exercise this summer indicated the militant group was preparing for the outlined attack — predicting, presciently, that it appeared “designed to start a war” — but that analysis was disregarded by a higher-up. To put it lightly, this is all a bad look for the Israeli national security state. Israeli defense officials had already conceded that they failed, catastrophically, in fulfilling their duty to protect Israeli citizens from attacks. But this new evidence underscores that Israel’s flat-footedness wasn’t an abject intelligence failure as much as it was a failure to appropriately assess the likelihood of a known attack plan — and taking tangible actions to guard against it. And it comes after a report that Israeli commanders repeatedly brushed aside lookouts’ warnings of suspicious activity in the weeks and the day before the attack, as well as reports that Egypt warned Israel that something was brewing. (Netanyahu has denied those allegations from Egyptian officials.) In light of all the warning signs, Israel’s defense establishment looks more hubristic than ignorant: “Underpinning all these failures was a single, fatally inaccurate belief that Hamas lacked the capability to attack and would not dare to do so,” the Times reports. Israel’s failure to prepare intensifies the sense of tragedy of about 1,200 people losing their lives to Hamas’ extraordinary war crimes (as well as over 240 being taken hostage). “Officials privately concede that, had the military taken these warnings seriously and redirected significant reinforcements to the south, where Hamas attacked, Israel could have blunted the attacks or possibly even prevented them,” the Times reports. It isn't yet known if Netanyahu was aware of the document outlining Hamas’ war plans. But a head of government will always be held accountable for national security failures, and that’s already been true for Netanyahu. Poll after poll indicates that an overwhelming majority of Israelis are unhappy with the prime minister and blame him for the security failures that allowed the attacks to happen. But that unhappiness isn’t just about Oct. 7. It’s also about Netanyahu’s policies that preceded it. Netanyahu’s critics point out that he played with fire when he reportedly tolerated and contained Hamas — including allowing foreign money to pass to the organization — as part of a strategy to divide Palestinians politically and kill a two-state solution. Some Israeli critics also say that Netanyahu’s fixation on defending illegal West Bank settlements resulted in his deploying battalions to defend those settlements when they could have otherwise been deployed to the southern border of Israel. In the heat of war, Netanyahu likely has some degree of short-term political security; the focus now is on a military operation in Gaza and retrieving hostages. But polling shows that Netanyahu is already vulnerable to challenges from political rivals, including former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who is polling well above Netanyahu and could, at any moment, leave the unity war Cabinet he agreed to form with Netanyahu. It’s also in the realm of possibility that Netanyahu’s opposition could win enough defectors from his coalition in the Knesset to set in motion a no-confidence vote. Netanyahu can’t be happy about any of this. He faces a growing body of evidence that his government and security forces could have taken steps to protect the country from attacks, and intensifying questions surrounding Israel’s decision-making may lead to greater international scrutiny of his military operation. An introspective leader might be humbled by this experience and reconsider the extreme policies and values that led to this crisis. Netanyahu, however, is not that kind of leader.

Politico,"Divers have found wreckage, 5 remains from Osprey aircraft that crashed off Japan, US Air Force says",2023-12-04 09:38:00,Associated Press,"TOKYO — U.S. and Japanese divers have discovered wreckage and the remains of five crew members from a U.S. Air Force Osprey aircraft that crashed last week off southwestern Japan, the Air Force announced Monday.The CV-22 Osprey carrying eight American personnel crashed last Wednesday off Yakushima island during a training mission. The body of one victim was recovered and identified earlier.The Air Force Special Operations Command said two of the five newly located remains have been recovered but their identities have yet to be determined. The joint U.S.-Japanese search operation is still working to recover the remains of three other crew members from the wreckage, it said.The search is continuing for the two people who are still missing, it said.“The main priority is bringing the Airmen home and taking care of their family members. Support to, and the privacy of, the families and loved ones impacted by this incident remains AFSOC’s top priority,” it said in a statement.The U.S. military identified the one confirmed victim as Air Force Staff Sgt. Jacob Galliher of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday.Japanese coast guard officials say the ocean is about 30 meters (100 feet) deep around the crash site.The U.S.-made Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much faster, like an airplane, during flight.Ospreys have had a number of crashes, including in Japan, where they are used at U.S. and Japanese military bases, and the latest accident has rekindled safety concerns.Japan has suspended all flights of its own fleet of 14 Ospreys. Japanese officials say they have asked the U.S. military to resume Osprey flights only after ensuring their safety. The Pentagon said no such formal request has been made and that the U.S. military is continuing to fly 24 MV-22s, the Marine version of Ospreys, deployed on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.On Sunday, pieces of wreckage that Japan’s coast guard and local fishing boats have collected were handed over to the U.S. military for examination, coast guard officials said. Japan’s military said debris it has collected would also be handed over to the U.S.Coast guard officials said the recovered pieces of wreckage include some parts of the aircraft and an inflatable life raft, but nothing related to the cause of the crash, such as an engine. Local witnesses reported seeing fire coming from one of the engines.Local fishing boats have helped in the search efforts, giving up their daily catch. Public broadcaster NHK said the Defense Ministry plans to cover their lost income and fuel.Under the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement, Japanese authorities are not given the right to seize or investigate U.S. military property unless the U.S. decides otherwise. That means it will be practically impossible for Japan to independently investigate the cause of the accident.The agreement has often made Japanese investigations difficult in criminal cases involving American service members on Okinawa and elsewhere. It has been criticized as unequal by rights activists and others, including Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki, who has called for a revision.",3200,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/04/divers-japan-osprey-crash-air-foce-00129875,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/6e0eaae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F23%2Ff0%2F8f6e5cf545eca0a526d2c66adc9b%2Fjapan-us-osprey-crash-49737.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,southern nhk sunday marine incident broadcaster report related fly crash meter rekindle plan call week version fishing announce criminal galliher piece foot tokyo ministry guard give confirm crew make public privacy impact late continue priority personnel unequal mission inflatable cruise decides japanese propeller bring home island american number activist top examination engine agreement training love military victim newly debris raft local revision jacob recover official suspend service remains identity involve massachusetts southwestern base tamaki investigation difficult support wreckage staff ocean request helicopter property determine effort boat pentagon ensure member afsoc status criticize search force yakushima case formal catch independently authority hand resume land aircraft wednesday osprey locate miss rotate deployed diver collect part air work fleet family fire okinawa denny japan sgt daily identify income body include special practically airman life seize defense deep witness forward operation crashed investigate hybrid flight safety joint faster pittsfield command cover coast carry accident lose impossible discover gov airplane,0.30945,0.0,11.934604316546764,0.3064135140222097,0,2023-12-04
New York Times,Israel-Hamas WarIsraeli Military’s Focus on Southern Gaza Could Signal Expanded War,2023-12-04 09:17:00,"Andrés R. Martínez, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Vivian Yee, Ameera Harouda, Peter Baker, Karoun Demirjian, Helene Cooper","Confusing evacuation orders leave Gazans to make painful decisions.The U.S. is pressing Israel and Hamas to return to talks, a White House official says.The U.S. shoots down 3 drones in the Red Sea as Iran-backed groups ramp up attacks.Israeli warplanes struck targets in southern Gaza on Monday as the military demanded that more civilians evacuate their homes in the area, signaling a possible expansion of its ground war in the battered Palestinian enclave.Days after a truce with Hamas collapsed, Israeli forces have turned their focus to southern Gaza, hitting areas where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter since the start of the war on Oct. 7. Israeli airstrikes targeted urban areas in the south, where photos on Monday showed smoke rising from flattened buildings in the city of Khan Younis and people carrying bodies swaddled in blankets away from scenes of destruction.Adding to speculation that Israel is preparing a ground invasion of the south, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said late Sunday that Israel “continues and expands its ground operations against Hamas strongholds all across the Gaza Strip,” although he did not elaborate.A senior official with Hamas, the armed group that controls much of Gaza, said late Sunday that Israeli ground troops had not entered the south. But Hamas’s military wing said that its fighters had targeted a tank and personnel carrier north of Khan Younis and several Israeli military vehicles in central Gaza. The claims could not be independently verified, and with communications networks disrupted, it was not possible to gain an independent assessment of the fighting.On Sunday, the Israeli military called on residents of parts of Khan Younis, the largest city in the south, to leave their homes, expanding an evacuation order that previously covered areas between the city and the Israeli border. The demands echoed similar orders Israel gave before sending troops into northern Gaza in late October, and the Israeli military has said they are intended to move civilians out of harm’s way.Oct. 13evacuationorderAreas underevacuationEvacuationzone boundaryMediterraneanSeaGAZASTRIPGAZASTRIPDeiral BalahISRAELAl QararaNewestevacuationorderEarlierevacuationordersBaniSuheilaAbasanKhanYounisKhuza’aRafahEGYPTRafahcrossingN1 mileOct. 13evacuationorderAreas underevacuationGAZASTRIPGAZASTRIPDeiral BalahISRAELNewestevacuationorderEarlierevacuationordersAl QararaBaniSuheilaAbasanKhanYounisKhuza’aRafahEGYPTRafahcrossingSource: Israeli military announcementsBy Lauren Leatherby/The New York TimesMany Gazans were left confused by the evacuation announcements, which were posted on social media in Arabic, accompanied by a map of Gaza that divided the territory into nearly 2,400 zones. The Israeli military advised residents to pay attention to Israeli announcements about whether their zone was being evacuated, but the United Nations said it was unclear whether many Gazans were able to see the online map, given disruptions in electricity and communications.After more than a month of fighting concentrated in northern Gaza — and a weeklong cease-fire that expired last Friday — Israel believes that the Hamas leaders who planned the Oct. 7 attacks that officials say left at least 1,200 people dead in Israel are hiding in the south. Israel’s military has responded to the attacks with nearly two months of airstrikes and a ground invasion of northern Gaza that have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health officials, and pushed an estimated 1.75 million Gazans south.Hundreds of people have been killed since hostilities resumed on Friday, according to Gazan health officials, who have warned that medical facilities remain desperately short of supplies, as Israel has sharply restricted the amount of humanitarian aid allowed to enter the enclave.Fighting has continued in other parts of Gaza. The Israeli military reported the deaths of three of its soldiers on Sunday, two in battles in northern Gaza and one in a battle in the central part of the strip.The Biden administration is pushing Israel and Hamas to resume negotiations that could lead to a new cease-fire. Under the previous truce, Hamas released scores of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for more than 200 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and Israel allowed more trucks carrying relief supplies into Gaza.U.S. officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, and international leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, have said that Israel must do more to protect civilians in Gaza. Mr. Macron is headed to Qatar, which mediated the original truce, in hopes of restarting talks.Vivian Yee, Iyad Abuheweila, Peter Baker and Karoun Demirjian contributed reporting.— Andrés R. MartínezThe city of Khan Younis, the largest in southern Gaza, was already densely populated before the war, and it became more crowded in recent weeks as people fled the north of the territory to escape Israel’s bombardment. Now Israel’s military has told residents of parts of the city itself to leave, or to take refuge at designated sites, intensifying the cycle of displacement.Israel is trying to eliminate Hamas, the Palestinian group that runs Gaza, and it says that some of the group’s leaders are hiding out in Khan Younis. The evacuation order issued on Sunday, it says, was for civilians’ safety. But the orders are particularly hard to follow in a place that has become packed with displaced people.In one example, 22,000 people have taken refuge at a training center in the city that is designed to shelter one-tenth of that number, according to the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Conditions are grim, with little access to running water or sanitation. People are sleeping in the open, and aid workers have largely stopped distributing water and flour because of the intensity of the fighting and Israeli bombardments, U.N. officials have said.Khan Younis had more than 200,000 residents before the war began on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.The city, whose history stretches back centuries, is now made up largely of apartment blocks set a couple of miles back from the sea. It is the site of a branch of Al-Quds Open University, a public institution that combines in-person and online learning.Before the conflict, nearly 90,000 people were registered at the Khan Younis refugee camp, one of eight run by the United Nations in Gaza. The camps were initially set up to receive many of the 750,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the Arab-Israeli war in 1948, which broke out when five Arab nations invaded after Israel declared independence.They have since become permanent dwellings, and the Khan Younis camp is in practice part of the wider metropolitan area.“Life for nearly all refugees in the camp has become increasingly difficult because of the blockade on Gaza, which has caused a dramatic deterioration of socioeconomic conditions, including ever-growing unemployment and poverty rates,” the U.N. agency that operates in Gaza, UNRWA, said.The agency said that, even before the conflict, “basic hygiene is another big concern with 90 percent of the camp’s water supply being unfit for human consumption.”— Matthew Mpoke BiggHalf of all buildings in northern Gaza are damaged or destroyed, according to satellite analysis estimates.Palestinians trying to make sense of a new, confusing round of Israeli evacuation orders were left to make painful decisions on Sunday, as the Israeli military appeared to be setting the stage for a ground invasion in southern Gaza.Abu Yousef, 42, and his family were among those who left the city of Khan Younis on Saturday night and headed to Al-Mawasi, a narrow agricultural area near the coast. They had seen on social media that the neighborhood where they were staying — their second temporary shelter after leaving their home in northern Gaza — might be marked for evacuation, but were not certain.Scanning a map that the Israeli military had provided, he could not tell whether they should go. Then they got a recorded call from the Israeli military ordering them to leave.“You can’t imagine the tough situation,” he said. “Your mind will stop working, because you have children, you have elderly that you have to move.”He wondered: What should they take with them? Water? Batteries? Mattresses?“It’s a lot of thinking,” he said. “And you don’t know where to go.”Other neighbors, clinging to the hope that their homes did not fall under the evacuation orders, decided to stay, he said.Mr. Yousef said his family had already moved twice, from the northernmost part of Gaza to Gaza City and then to Khan Younis, before packing up again for their third displacement on Saturday night. Every time they thought they had found a solution, he said, “you evacuate again.”In Al-Mawasi, Mr. Yousef said his family was staying under a nylon tarp stretched over some wood and sharing one bathroom at a relative’s house nearby. Asked how he planned to get food for his family, he responded: “I don’t know. I don’t have an answer.”Oct. 13evacuationorderAreas underevacuationEvacuationzone boundaryMediterraneanSeaGAZASTRIPGAZASTRIPDeiral BalahISRAELAl QararaNewestevacuationorderEarlierevacuationordersBaniSuheilaAbasanKhanYounisKhuza’aAl-MawasiRafahEGYPTRafahcrossingN1 mileOct. 13evacuationorderAreas underevacuationGAZASTRIPGAZASTRIPDeiral BalahISRAELNewestevacuationorderEarlierevacuationordersAl QararaBaniSuheilaAbasanKhanYounisKhuza’aAl-MawasiRafahEGYPTRafahcrossingSource: Israeli military announcementsBy Lauren Leatherby/The New York TimesOn Sunday afternoon, a spokesman for the Gazan health ministry, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, said 316 people had been killed in Israeli strikes “in the past hours.” He said that more than 15,500 people had been killed since Oct. 7, when the war began.Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency, reported on Sunday that 60 people had been killed in airstrikes on the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, along with dozens more in Jabaliya, a long-established camp, and Beit Lahia, a town in northern Gaza. It said dozens of others were also killed in Al-Zaytoun and Al-Shuja’iya, both neighborhoods in Gaza City.There was little safety to be found in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops have resumed ground operations following a weeklong pause. The aid group Doctors Without Borders said Israeli tanks had destroyed some of its marked vehicles outside of its clinic in Gaza City on Sunday and started a fire that consumed trees and electrical wiring nearby.“My colleagues were in the clinic, and I was afraid the fire could reach them,” an unidentified staff member who filmed the attack said in a video the group shared on social media.“It was a horrible scene,” he added.Iyad Abuheweila contributed reporting.— Vivian Yee and Ameera HaroudaThe U.S. government is making an intense effort to persuade Israel and Hamas to resume negotiations so they can once again pause hostilities and exchange more prisoners for hostages, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.“We are still working it really hard, hour by hour, to see if we can get the sides back to the table and see if we can get something moving,” John F. Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the White House National Security Council, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “We would like that to happen today. But honestly, I just don’t know.”In appearances on several Sunday talk shows, Mr. Kirby emphasized that Hamas was to blame for the breakdown in talks, saying that it had not lived up to the terms of its original agreement to begin handing over captives held in Gaza.He said Hamas had failed to produce a list of women and children who could be released in addition to the 105 hostages who were freed during the original pause in fighting. Among those still held are eight or nine Americans. Osama Hamdan, a representative for Hamas in Lebanon, said on Sunday that negotiations over the hostages would not resume until the Israeli assault stopped.Israel has since resumed its attacks on Hamas, and Mr. Kirby urged it to avoid civilian casualties, while crediting its forces with making efforts to do so. He said Israeli authorities had been open to U.S. advice about how to make their assault more precise.“We believe that they have been receptive to our messages here in terms of trying to minimize civilian casualties,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” He noted that Israel had published a map directing civilians to what it said were safe zones.“There’s not a whole lot of modern militaries that would do that, I mean, that is, to telegraph their punches in that way,” he said. “So they are making an effort.”President Biden and his administration have sought to straddle a careful line nearly two months after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack in which Hamas killed an estimated 1,200 people in Israel and took about 240 more hostage. While supporting Israel’s right to defend itself, the administration has also sought to restrain Israel from what it believes would be going too far in its response.That led to criticism from both the left and the right on Sunday, as some Republicans complained that Mr. Biden’s team was trying to hold Israel back, while some liberal Democrats complained that it was not doing that enough.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, singled out Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III. In a speech on Saturday, Mr. Austin warned that Israel should protect civilians in Gaza and prevent violence against Palestinians by Jewish settlers in the West Bank, because otherwise “you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Mr. Graham castigated Mr. Austin, a retired four-star general who fought in Iraq. “He’s so naïve; I mean I just lost all confidence in this guy,” Mr. Graham said.“If we were attacked like this, which we were on 9/11, if somebody called for us within two months to have a cease-fire against Al Qaeda, we’d have laughed them out of town, we’d have run them out of town,” Mr. Graham added. “Secretary Austin is telling Israel things that are impossible to achieve.”Mr. Graham said his solution to the hostage impasse would be to threaten Iran, the sponsor of Hamas. “I would go to Iran and say listen, you need to tell Hamas to let these hostages go,” he said. “If you don’t, you’re going to start paying a heavier price.”On the other side of the ideological spectrum, Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, said on the same program that the Biden administration had a responsibility to stop Israel from killing so many civilians.“The United States cannot be backers of this kind of indiscriminate bombing — that is my firm belief,” she said. “We should have conditions on military aid in the same way that we do for every other country.”While the White House blamed Hamas for the breakdown in hostage talks, Ms. Jayapal faulted Israel.“Qatar has said that Hamas is still at the table,” she said, referring to the Persian Gulf emirate that has served as the intermediary for the talks. “Israel should still be at the table. In fact, some of the Israeli hostages are saying that Israel should still be at the table, because this is complex negotiation and it doesn’t happen unless both sides are willing to come to some kind of an agreement.”Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.— Peter Baker and Karoun Demirjian Reporting from WashingtonA U.S. Navy destroyer shot down three drones during a sustained attack in the Red Sea on Sunday, the Pentagon said, in what could signal another escalation in the tit-for-tat attacks between the American military and Iranian-backed militants.A Pentagon official said the U.S.S. Carney shot down the drones as several commercial ships nearby came under fire as part of an attack that began at 9:15 a.m. and lasted for several hours on Sunday. The destroyer intercepted three drones during the attack, United States Central Command said in a statement, including one that was headed in the direction of the Carney. The Pentagon said there were no injuries onboard the destroyer and that the ship was not damaged.In the statement, Central Command said the attacks originated from areas in Yemen that are controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia. Since the Oct. 7 incursion into Israel led by Hamas, the Houthis based in Yemen have launched a series of attacks — including with drones and missiles — on Israeli and American targets in the Red Sea.A Houthi military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, said in a statement on Sunday that the militia had targeted two Israeli ships in the area of the Bab al-Mandeb strait off southern Yemen, but did not mention the American naval vessel. The group fired a missile at one ship and targeted a second with a drone, he said, adding that the Houthis would continue to prevent Israeli ships from sailing in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until Israel’s military “stops its aggression” in Gaza.In October, the Carney shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched from Yemen that the Pentagon said might have been headed toward Israel.One of the drones on Sunday “was headed toward Carney, although its specific target is not clear,” Central Command said in the statement, adding, “we cannot assess at this time whether the Carney was a target” of the drones.After Hamas attacked Israel, the Biden administration rushed two aircraft carriers and additional troops to the eastern Mediterranean near Israel to deter Iran and its proxies in the region from expanding the war.Sunday’s attack underscored the risks that the fight in Gaza could spiral into a wider conflict. For more than a month, Iranian-backed militias have conducted drone and rocket attacks against the 2,500 American troops based in Iraq and the 900 troops in Syria.In its statement, Central Command said “we have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran. The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international allies and partners.”Shuaib Almosawa contributed reporting.— Helene

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has become increasingly isolated following a crackdown on political opponents and his support for ally Russia in its war on Ukraine.But the heavily state-controlled economy of Belarus has dimmed possibilities for major economic cooperation with China.China “opposes external interference in Belarus’ internal affairs,” Xi was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying, a reflection of China’s unofficial alliance with authoritarian states from Cuba to Russia in opposition to the U.S.-led liberal democratic global order.Xinhua said Xi and Lukashenko “also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis,"" but the news agency did not give details of their discussion about the conflict.Russia used Belarus as a staging ground for troops and equipment before Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",1258,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chinas-xi-welcomes-president-alexander-lukashenko-belarus-beijing-105354838,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/edeec49d-efd8-4d23-b3f3-9bf1f8d1cb4d/wirestory_da1b089345967637a2047099264d36c6_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,increasingly economy opposes exchange country ukraine interference build russia give belarusian reflection isolated coordination nation crackdown xinhua economic infrastructure stag dim european state russian greece ally support initiative road invasion xi authoritarian external global quote jinping equipment detail liberal vladimir putin chinese affair view lukashenko spoke troop alexander crisis president possibility mutual make follow leader official opponent political cooperation news internal opposition china heavily unofficial member major alliance ground beijing core belarus cuba agency strengthen malaysia accord trust sought international belt democratic discussion,0.10025,0.2384737678855326,14.745365853658534,0.123076923076923,0,2023-12-04
ABC,Spanish newspaper association files multimillion-euro suit against Meta over advertising practices,2023-12-04 08:33:00,CIARÁN GILES Associated Press,"MADRID -- A Spanish association representing more than 80 newspapers has filed a lawsuit against Facebook parent Meta accusing it of unfair competition in online advertising by allegedly ignoring European Union rules on data protection.In a statement, the Information Media Association said it is demanding 550 million euros ($600 million) from the social media giant. The association represents dozens of newspapers including Spain’s principal dailies El País, El Mundo, ABC and La Vanguardia.The association accuses Meta of “systematic and massive non-compliance” with EU data protection regulations between May 2018, when they took force, and July 2023.It said Meta has repeatedly ignored the requirement that citizens give their consent to the use of their data for advertising profiling.The company declined to comment, saying it hadn't seen the legal papers.Meta’s Facebook and Instagram platforms have long used behavioral advertising to make money. The practice involves tracking individual online behavior such as web browsing habits, mouse clicks and app usage, then using that data to build profiles for targeting ads to users.But court rulings have eroded Meta's ability to justify its methods under the EU's data privacy regulations. In July, the EU's top court ruled the company can't force users in the 27-nation bloc to agree to personalized ads, saying users need to freely give their consent. Meta responded by offering ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram for European users for a monthly fee.The Spanish association said the use of personal data of users of Meta platforms, tracked without their consent, allowed the U.S. company to offer advertising space based on an “illegitimately obtained competitive advantage,” indirectly threatening the livelihood of Spanish media.It called on advertisers in the public and private sectors “to entrust their advertising campaigns to safe, reliable and responsible media, respectful of the rights of citizens and committed to promoting democratic quality in Spain.”“The time has come to put an end to the behavior of technology companies that can afford to pay million-dollar penalties to continue failing to comply with regulations, destroying the market in which we operate and making the illegitimately obtained income their own,” said Irene Lanzaco, director general of the association.The case was filed at Madrid's mercantile courts.___",2409,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/spanish-newspaper-association-files-multimillion-euro-suit-meta-105354759,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/0d6d4407-513e-40f8-b234-4a2081431986/wirestory_515bccf08cbcbf045be82144a42f7bee_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,responsible competition newspaper base lanzaco medium spain social quality lawsuit involves indirectly destroy advantage method target accuse freely campaign requirement behavior privacy offering operate statement public comment tracked consent browsing director allegedly citizen monthly put systematic obtain ability instagram demand repeatedly spanish top money mercantile individual protection ignore court july bloc facebook call app make pay madrid continue meta rule platform income regulation offer euro dozen association represent private behavioral union commit illegitimately technology usage personalize version case force advertising ruling profile sector data build safe país give space company online mundo european personal threaten livelihood massive long information giant respectful practice entrust million click afford web respond parent habit agree irene comply abc mouse advertiser market general time reliable principal decline competitive erode include justify unfair promote penalty legal accuses user fail daily track file democratic,0.20315,0.12453300124533,13.583012345679013,0.4022435897435897,0,2023-12-04
ABC,UN warns that 2 boats adrift on Andaman Sea with 400 Rohingya aboard desperately need rescue,2023-12-04 08:09:00,GRANT PECK Associated Press,"BANGKOK -- The U.N. refugee agency on Monday sounded the alarm for about 400 Rohingya Muslims believed to be aboard two boats reported to be out of supplies and adrift on the Andaman Sea.The agency, also called UNHCR, worries that all aboard could die without efforts to rescue them, said Babar Baloch, its Bangkok-based regional spokesperson.“There are about 400 children, women and men looking death in the eye if there are no moves to save these desperate souls,” he told The Associated Press. He said the boats that apparently embarked from Bangladesh are reported to have been at sea for about two weeks.The captain of one boat, contacted by the AP on Saturday, said he had 180 to 190 people on board, they were out of food and water and the engine was damaged.“They are worried they are all going to die,”″ said the captain, who gave his name as Maan Nokim.On Sunday, Nokim said the boat was 320 kilometers (200 miles) from Thailand's west coast. A Thai navy spokesperson, contacted Monday, said he had not received any information about the boats.The location is about the same distance from Indonesia’s northernmost province of Aceh on the island of Sumatra, where another boat with 139 people landed Saturday, UNHCR’s Baloch said. He said they included 58 children, 45 women and 36 men, reflecting the typical balance of those making the sea journey. Hundreds more arrived in Aceh last month.There is a seasonal exodus of Rohingyas, usually coming from overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.About 740,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to the camps in Bangladesh since August 2017 after a brutal counterinsurgency campaign tore through their communities. Myanmar security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and the burning of thousands of Rohingya homes.International courts are considering whether their actions constituted genocide.Most of the refugees leaving the camps by sea attempt to reach Muslim-dominated Malaysia, where they seek work. Thailand, reached by some boats, turns them away or detains them. Indonesia, another Muslim-dominated country where many end up, also puts them in detention.Baloch with UNHCR said if the two adrift boats are not given assistance, the world “may witness another tragedy such as in December 2022 when a boat with 180 aboard went missing in one of the darkest such incidents in the region.”___",2383,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/warns-2-boats-adrift-andaman-sea-400-rohingya-105353642,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,sound seasonal death rohingyas exodus incident water action bangladesh province babar kilometer muslim rape worried accuse alarm thailand associate thai woman campaign august coast away put seek location security refugee turn supply soul consider thousand court board believe attempt hundred call make spokesperson regional receive mile boat miss typical assistance tragedy contact save move adrift reach island baloch leave myanmar force report country distance worry saturday monday rescue give reflect press sunday navy bangkok counterinsurgency constitute witness burning land overcrowd engine information camp mass rohingya andaman desperate detains arrive embark indonesia december darkest eye killing unhcr aboard west effort world apparently sumatra work include told food flee captain community northernmost nokim agency malaysia journey child brutal aceh tore balance,-0.9862,0.1258917331095258,10.751152073732715,0.4451388888888889,0,2023-12-04
NPR,Divers find wreckage and remains from Osprey aircraft that crashed off Japan,2023-12-04 08:05:00,The Associated Press,"TOKYO â€” U.S. and Japanese divers have discovered wreckage and remains of crew members from a U.S. Air Force Osprey aircraft that crashed last week off southwestern Japan, the Air Force announced Monday. The CV-22 Osprey carrying eight American personnel crashed last Wednesday off Yakushima island during a training mission. The body of one victim was recovered and identified earlier, while seven others remained missing. The Air Force Special Operations Command said the remains were being recovered and their identities have yet to be determined. ""The main priority is bringing the Airmen home and taking care of their family members. Support to, and the privacy of, the families and loved ones impacted by this incident remains AFSOC's top priority,"" it said in a statement. The U.S. military identified the one confirmed victim as Air Force Staff Sgt. Jacob Galliher of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday. On Monday, divers from the Japanese navy and U.S. military spotted what appeared to be the front section of the Osprey, along with possibly five of the missing crew members, Japan's NHK public television and other media reported. Japanese navy officials declined to confirm the reports, saying they could not release details without consent from the U.S. The U.S.-made Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much faster, like an airplane, during flight. Ospreys have had a number of crashes, including in Japan, where they are used at U.S. and Japanese military bases, and the latest accident rekindled safety concerns. Japan has suspended all flights of its own fleet of 14 Ospreys. Japanese officials say they have asked the U.S. military to resume Osprey flights only after ensuring their safety. The Pentagon said no such formal request has been made and that the U.S. military is continuing to fly 24 MV-22s, the Marine version of Ospreys, deployed on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa. On Sunday, pieces of wreckage that Japan's coast guard and local fishing boats have collected were handed over to the U.S. military for examination, coast guard officials said. Japan's military said debris it has collected would also be handed over to the U.S. Coast guard officials said the recovered pieces of wreckage include parts of the aircraft and an inflatable life raft but nothing related to the cause of the crash, such as an engine. Local witnesses reported seeing fire coming from one of the engines. Under the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement, Japanese authorities are not given the right to seize or investigate U.S. military property unless the U.S. decides otherwise. That means it will be practically impossible for Japan to independently investigate the cause of the accident. The agreement has often made Japanese investigations difficult in criminal cases involving American service members on Okinawa and elsewhere, and has been criticized as unequal by rights activists and others, including Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki, who has called for a revision.",3073,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216945245/osprey-japan-wreckage-air-force,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/11/29/gettyimages-175372884_sq-75d0e18588a8b78177097c817e8bc0486ef223f9-s100-c15.jpg,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,confirm incident fishing base accident wreckage concern japan request criticize medium television faster local decides body bring release number debris ensure revision massachusetts property yakushima resume privacy statement public consent coast criminal crashed carry airplane independently authority examination command piece airman determine top american mission marine impact call recover home front make involve official formal miss boat gov continue family air staff crash rekindle service member collect spot agreement victim galliher difficult island identify diver impossible status fire southwestern cruise fleet love version case force identity report earlier special pittsfield rotate saturday monday announce give unequal related sunday investigate navy fly raft denny witness forward support guard week land remains engine tamaki flight life detail inflatable military safety wednesday training discover crew okinawa remain southern hybrid investigation tokyo afsoc priority activist section practically decline late nhk jacob osprey aircraft include personnel hand operation part seize propeller suspend helicopter possibly sgt japanese deployed pentagon,-0.23475,0.0,10.732212065813528,0.3038872691933916,0,2023-12-04
New York Times,5 Bodies Found After Days of Searching for U.S. Military Aircraft in Japan,2023-12-04 08:03:00,"Hikari Hida, John Yoon","Hikari Hida reported from Tokyo, and John Yoon from Seoul.The U.S. Air Force said on Monday that the bodies of five crew members had been found alongside the wreckage of a CV-22 Osprey that went down during a routine training exercise last week in southern Japan.Two crew members remain unaccounted for, and the remains of one had been discovered on Wednesday, the day of the crash. Over the weekend, the Air Force identified that airman as Staff Sgt. Jacob M. Galliher, 24. The body of Sergeant Galliher, a young father who went by the first name Jake, had been found by the Japan Coast Guard.Pieces of the fallen aircraft had been located on the ocean floor on Wednesday less than a mile from the Japanese island of Yakushima, according to the Japan Coast Guard. The U.S. Air Force said that a breakthrough in the five-day search came on Monday, when a combined Japanese and American team found the Osprey’s fuselage.On Friday, Japan’s defense minister, Minoru Kihara, said he had met with Lt. Gen. Ricky Rupp, the commander of United States Forces Japan, and asked that all Osprey flights not related to search and rescue activities be suspended until the aircraft’s safety could be confirmed.Advertisement“The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to make various appeals to the U.S. side to ensure the safety of the Osprey,” Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said at a news conference on Friday.For now, the United States is continuing to operate the Ospreys in Japan while search and rescue operations and an investigation continue, the Pentagon’s deputy press secretary, Sabrina Singh, said at a news conference on Thursday.The CV-22s, operated mainly by the Air Force, have been stationed in Japan since 2018. The aircraft that crashed on Wednesday was based at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo and assigned to the Air Force’s 353rd Special Operations Wing, the Pentagon said. Six CV-22s are based at Yokota.The Osprey, made by the American aerospace companies Bell Textron and Boeing, is a uniquely complex aircraft. With two rotor blades above extended wings, it can take off and land vertically and can glide like a fixed-wing aircraft, which means pilots need mastery of flying both helicopters and airplanes.AdvertisementThe aircraft’s history of accidents has prompted concerns about its safety. As of the beginning of November, 53 deaths had been linked to Osprey accidents since the Marine Corps began using the aircraft in the early 1990s, according to the Aviation Safety Network of the Flight Safety Foundation. Three months ago, three U.S. Marines died in an Osprey accident during a training exercise in Australia.In the first major accident in Japan involving the aircraft, an Osprey crash-landed in the sea off the southern island of Okinawa in December 2016, prompting the U.S. military to ground its entire fleet of Ospreys for about a week. When flights resumed, local residents and the governor of Okinawa were angered, and Japan’s defense minister urged the U.S. military to take preventive measures.The last deadly U.S. military aircraft accident in Japan was in December 2018, when a KC-130 Hercules and an F/A-18 Hornet crashed, killing at least five Marines.Hikari Hida reports from the Tokyo bureau, where she covers news and features in Japan.

TEL AVIV, Israel — The plight of Palestinian refugees, hemmed in and cut off by Israeli combat operations in Gaza, is becoming more acute as infrastructure is destroyed and civilian deaths rise in the wake of a cease-fire that ended last week, aid officials said Monday. ""People have lost everything and they need everything,"" UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency that aids Palestinian, said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). ""Gaza's population will soon begin dying from diseases as well as Israeli bombardment."" More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. That figure includes more than 6,000 children and 4,000 women. The Gaza health ministry also says more than 300 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded since the fighting resumed four days ago. Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, arrived in Gaza on Monday, where she said ""people's suffering is intolerable."" ""I repeat our urgent call for civilians to be protected in line with the laws of war and for aid to enter unimpeded,"" she posted on X. The heightened concerns come as video posted to social media appears to show Israeli tanks and soldiers pushing farther south in pursuit of Hamas. NPR has not been able to independently verify these videos. On Oct. 7, the Palestinian Islamist militant group launched a surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, Israel says. Israel responded with massive airstrikes and a ground invasion of Gaza. Over the weekend, Israel's military robocalled Palestinians in and around Gaza's second-largest city of Khan Younis, directing them to move to ""safer zones"" to avoid intensified combat operations. It was unclear how many Palestinians in Gaza received the calls on their cell phones or were able to make sense of the information. On Friday, Israel's military directed residents in Gaza to refer to an online map to find areas free of fighting. However, many found the map confusing or had trouble accessing it because of connectivity issues. The map also directed people into increasingly overcrowded areas, potentially exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Ashraf Al Nahal, 43, took refuge in Khan Younis two weeks ago but says it's no longer safe there. ""They are bombing the area,"" he told NPR. He has since left, heading south near the border with Egypt. ""They are bombing houses,"" he said. ""We took the women and children and fled to Rafah."" However, Israel was also carrying out airstrikes in areas of Rafah and the humanitarian situation was far from good, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In its latest update, OCHA said the Rafah governorate ""was the one [area] in Gaza where limited aid distributions, primarily of flour and water, took place"" on Sunday.

""In the adjacent Khan Younis governorate, aid distribution largely stopped due to the intensity of hostilities,"" it said. UNRWA said that 1.1 million internally displaced people — half of Gaza's total population — were registered in 156 U.N. facilities across Gaza. ""Another 191,000 [internally displaced persons] are estimated to be staying in 124 public schools and hospitals, as well as in other venues such as wedding halls, offices, and community centers."" The agency warned that it has witnessed ""significant increases in some communicable diseases and conditions such as diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, skin infections and hygiene-related conditions like lice. There are also initial reports of disease outbreaks, including hepatitis A."" In the first weeks of the war, Israeli forces concentrated combat operations on the north of the Gaza Strip, warning people living there to flee south. However, since the cease-fire collapsed on Friday, the focus of combat operations has increasingly shifted south. The effect has been to force civilians into an ever-smaller area of Gaza. On Sunday, Israel's military said it had destroyed more than 60% of the 800 Hamas tunnel shafts that it has identified since the start of the war. ""The tunnel shafts were located in civilian areas, many of which were near or inside civilian buildings and structures, such as schools, kindergartens, mosques and playgrounds,"" the military said. ""IDF soldiers located large quantities of weapons inside some of the shafts. These findings are further proof of how Hamas deliberately uses the civilian population and infrastructure as a cover for its terrorist activity inside Gaza.""",5130,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216813827/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages-ceasefire-airstrikes,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/12/04/ap23337319371447_wide-d946056cb1a54f111276137bb69f9c01b255b393-s1100-c50.jpg,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hamas concern water center collapse large medium suffer enter social south invasion population woman public figure carry x independently refugee crisis call push make heighten official focus wake israel air video flour concentrate combat aid effect half strip law access avoid situation shaft primarily acute fire force head rise weekend urgent left cut photo image coordination bombardment infrastructure hatem initial rafah massive robocalled week potentially militant plight adjacent egypt displace school million day affair ashraf person arrive start office begin president hide inside living bombing formerly disease warn register largely venue terrorist hospital ago late idf zone ministry civilian hepatitis increase attack condition unimpeded community surprise agency repeat helicopter committee accord found wedding egger khan free resident cross increasingly post cover death caption issue stop building locate palestinian nation tunnel stay distribution city npr red protect group health resume line unrwa respiratory nahal getty place spoljaric jack kindergarten airstrikes refer facility exacerbate younis hundred safer receive fight gaza phone daniel soldier activity islamist internally outbreak move identify conflict pursuit proof humanitarian cell israeli north area international missile confuse total diarrhea communicable report connectivity safe unclear significant monday map hall sunday deliberately estrin structure relief limited online direct witness destroyed playground overcrowd governorate refuge aviv tank skin information survivor kill border farther longer military estimate lose show tel wound respond mosque find finding intensity southern intensified verify infection mirjana twitter united weapon quantity hostility launch house include told flee trouble ground ocha due operation intolerable shift louse friday child update,-0.99335,0.3508771929824562,9.604054336468128,0.373015873015873,0,2023-12-04

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., demanded an investigation into allegations that a controversial United Nations agency's employee detained one of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.""The United States will not be complicit in propping up Hamas' terrorism, and this report further proves why deep change is necessary within UNRWA before we even consider providing another dollar to the agency,"" Blackburn wrote in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital and addressed to U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield and United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini.""It is deeply concerning that, despite the prevalence of these reports, the United Nations has seemingly done nothing to investigate or prevent the siphoning of UNRWA funding by terrorists, and UNRWA continues to double down on its claims that each subsequent, documented report is ‘unsubstantiated.’""Blackburn has requested a response by Dec. 18 that addresses a report from Israeli reporter Almog Boker about a UNRWA employee who allegedly detained a hostage in their house for 50 days and details of any investigation into the report, as well as an explanation of UNRWA's ""process for ensuring its facilities are not used to support terrorist activities,"" among other points.UN ACCOUNT HIT FOR EXPLICITLY CONDEMNING HAMAS' ATTACK ON ISRAEL EIGHT WEEKS LATER: ‘TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH’Boker, a journalist with Israeli Channel 13, last week claimed on social media platform X that he had interviewed a recently released hostage who told him a UNRWA teacher held them hostage.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)""One of the abductees, held for nearly 50 days in an attic, reveals he was held by a [UNRWA] teacher – a father of ten children,"" Boker wrote. ""This teacher locked the victim away, barely provided food, and neglected medical needs … These are not isolated incidents; these civilians are terrorists,"" Boker wrote. ""Present at the Saturday massacre, they're now revealed as integral to holding hundreds captive, including women and children.""UNRWA pushed back on the claim, calling it ""unsubstantiated"" after Boker did not immediately respond to their requests for additional information, saying in an official statement, ""UNRWA and other entities in the United Nations have asked the journalist to provide more information on what we consider to be a very serious allegation. Despite repeated demands, the journalist has not responded.""US WARSHIP, MULTIPLE COMMERCIAL VESSELS REPORTEDLY ATTACKED IN RED SEAThe UNRWA has faced several allegations, including corruption and directly helping Hamas, as documented in an X community note. Reuters reported on a former headmaster at a UNRWA school who helped build rockets for Islamic Jihad while employed by the agency, as well as posts from several UNRWA teachers and administrators celebrating the Oct. 7 attack.The agency urged the journalist to provide ""immediate clarification"" on the claims and that ""in the absence of credible information to support this claim, UNRWA requests the journalist immediately delete the post.""Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, holds a press conference in Jerusalem on Oct. 27, 2023.

""We have known for years that this is an antisemitic organization.

(Mahmud Hams/AFP)""Teaching materials branded with the U.N. Agency logo created by UNRWA education departments as well as textbooks used in its schools in Gaza teach kids to glorify violence and promote terror for years,"" Sheff said. ""It is no surprise that a UNRWA teacher was involved in the hostage taking by Hamas given the daily indoctrination he is involved with every day.""""The U.S. must join Germany and other European countries reassessing and conditioning their aid to UNRWA until it uses an alternative curriculum that promotes peace and tolerance otherwise another Oct 7th will occur as Hamas leaders promise,"" Sheff demanded.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPInternational Red Cross vehicles reportedly carrying Israeli hostages released by Hamas cross the Rafah border point in Gaza on the way to Egypt from which they would be flown to Israel to be reunited with their families on Nov. 24, 2023.

The authorities were investigating Ms. Chow on suspicion of collusion with external elements, a vaguely defined political crime that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. She was later released on bail.Ms. Chow wrote in an Instagram post on Sunday that she had traveled to Canada in September to study at a university. She said she had decided not to return to Hong Kong in December to report to the police, as the authorities had requested. “Perhaps I will never go back again in my lifetime,” she wrote.Hong Kong’s national security department, without referring to Ms. Chow by name, condemned her expressed intention to “openly jump bail.” In a statement on Monday, the department urged Ms. Chow to “immediately turn back” to avoid being branded a fugitive for life. In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman who was asked about Ms. Chow’s statement said that no one was above the law and that illegal acts would be punished.AdvertisementMs. Chow, 27, rose to prominence as a teenage activist in 2012 protesting government plans to introduce “patriotic education” in Hong Kong’s schools, alongside Joshua Wong. She later became one of the more prominent young leaders of the pro-democracy movement in 2014. In 2020, she was imprisoned for her role in a protest outside the headquarters of the police during a wave of antigovernment demonstrations the previous summer; she was released early after serving nearly seven months.She was also separately arrested in 2020 on suspicion of a national security offense, and, as part of her bail conditions, her travel documents were confiscated, and she had to routinely check in with police, according to the police statement on Monday.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Tiffany May covers news from Asia.

""There is hope but I think it will be a mix of survivors and dead bodies.”Chingola District Commissioner Raphael Chumupi said at least 36 miners were buried in three separate tunnels while they were digging for copper ore illegally at the Seseli mine without the knowledge of the mine owner. Zambian government officials said more than 30 miners were trapped under the landslides but couldn't give an exact number.Police have said that all the miners are suspected to have died and named seven of them as confirmed fatalities. But no bodies have been retrieved and the Zambian government said it was premature to say how many had died.Zambian Vice President Mutale Nalumango said in a statement that rescuers were still removing debris and pumping water out of the tunnels in the hope of finding some survivors.“Their condition remains unknown,” Nalumango said of the miners. Rescue efforts were being hampered by more rain and one of the three sites where rescuers were working was completely waterlogged, she said.

I must tell the French people the truth that there are numerous cases like this,"" the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said Monday, adding that around one-third of suspected radicals under surveillance have psychiatric issues.Speaking to broadcaster BFMTV, the minister said French officials should be given greater powers to force people in such cases to seek psychiatric treatment.“There appears to have been a psychiatric failing because doctors on multiple occasions decided that he was better, that he was more normal and could live freely,” he said.A few weeks before the attack, the suspect's mother had told police that her son had stopped taking his medicines, but she was apparently too scared of him to ask that he be hospitalized, the minister said.",1491,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/french-investigation-fatal-attack-eiffel-tower-mental-illness-105351732,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/442d58be-f92c-4cea-a24b-a9601ea22325/wirestory_7cdfb808b7344a50a8ad2ae2d2725e90_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,death national question stop stab radical state decide freely murder fatal group health suspect tower live olympic seek charge security swore history custody eiffel islamic armand psychiatric official power raise police paris host allegiance hospitalize multiple truth mother add illness case interior force weekend saturday monday give doctor gérald mental night normal link week broadcaster scar great minister undeniably tourist french possible radicalization assailant investigation game medicine injure occasion islam numerous bfmtv apparently told surveillance attack fresh darmanin fail preliminary capital,-0.94225,0.0,12.839687499999997,0.343,0,2023-12-04

ABC,Dutch lawyers seek a civil court order to halt the export of F-35 fighter jet parts to Israel,2023-12-04 05:49:00,MIKE CORDER Associated Press,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Human rights lawyers went to court in the Netherlands on Monday to call for a halt to the export of fighter jet parts to Israel that could be used in attacks on Gaza.The organizations allege that delivery of parts for F-35 jets makes the Netherlands complicit in possible war crimes being committed by Israel in its war with Hamas.The civil case in The Hague opened as the Israeli military renewed calls for mass evacuations from the southern town of Khan Younis, where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge in recent weeks, as it widened its ground offensive and bombarded targets across the Gaza Strip.The rights lawyers want The Hague District Court to issue an injunction banning the exports of F-35 parts that are stored in a warehouse in the town of Woensdrecht.“The state must immediately stop the delivery of F-35 parts to Israel,” lawyer Liesbeth Zegveld told the court.Citing government documents, Zegveld said that Dutch customs asked the government if it wanted to continue exports after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas that triggered the Israel-Hamas war.“The warning that the fighter jets can contribute to serious breaches of the laws of war does not, for the (Dutch) state, outweigh its economic interests and diplomatic reputation.”Government lawyer Reimer Veldhuis urged the court's single judge to reject the injunction, saying that even if it were to uphold the rights lawyers' legal arguments and ban exports, “the United States would deliver these parts to Israel from another place.”He added that Israel has the right to self-defense.“Israel must be able to respond to threats from the region. That must, of course, happen within the framework of international law,” Veldhuis said.He added that the government “believes that a clear risk of serious breaches (of international law) through the use of F-35s cannot at the moment be established.”A ruling is expected within two weeks and can be appealed.___",1974,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/dutch-lawyers-seek-civil-court-order-halt-export-105351288,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/734e616a-1b4d-493c-896d-865a65c04728/wirestory_0285fa4d044d53ff4db9e885430e8a71_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,region hamas trigger reject allege issue stop export palestinian evacuation course state crime target halt renew hague argument uphold custom fighter diplomatic human breach younis widen court ten thousand believe call ban organization make dutch outweigh moment gaza single israel offensive continue bombard netherlands expect lawyer law deliver recent injunction commit israeli add sought international case ruling monday document immediately clear veldhuis economic framework week refuge zegveld risk urge contribute reimer mass displace town military complicit possible government respond happen threat southern warn store united district open told ground attack delivery jet legal warehouse liesbeth part civil judge khan interest,-0.95505,0.0,11.462197183098588,0.3338541666666667,0,2023-12-04
ABC,North Korea accuses US of double standards for letting South Korea launch spy satellite from US soil,2023-12-04 05:46:00,HYUNG-JIN KIM Associated Press,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Monday accused the United States of double standards, slamming it for letting rival South Korea launch a spy satellite from U.S. territory after condemning the North’s earlier satellite launch.Last Friday, South Korea launched its first domestically built spy satellite into space from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base. That came after North Korea put its own military spy satellite into orbit for the first time on Nov. 21.Unlike the South Korean launch, North Korea’s satellite liftoff drew immediate, strong rebukes from Washington, Seoul and their partners because it violated U.N. Security Council resolutions. The world body views any North Korean launch using ballistic technology as a cover for testing its missile technology. North Korea maintains it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles in the face of what it calls U.S.-led military threats.“It is a space-level tragicomedy that the U.S., going frantic with illegal denunciation and sanctions moves over the exercise of (North Korea’s) sovereignty, has shown behavior based on double standards by launching a spy satellite of (South Korea) in a shameless manner,” an unidentified spokesperson for the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a statement.The statement said if “the gangster-like logic of the U.S. … is connived and tolerated, global peace and stability will be exposed to an irrevocable grave danger.”North Korea has said its spy satellite transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t yet released any of those satellite photos. Many outside experts question whether it can send militarily useful high-resolution imagery.North Korea has said it’ll launch additional spy satellites to better monitor its rivals’ moves and enhance the precision-guided strike capability of its missiles.South Korea also plans to launch four more spy satellites by 2025 under a contract with SpaceX. The establishment of its own space-based surveillance network would ease its dependence on U.S. spy satellites to monitor strategic facilities in North Korea. Experts say launching a satellite aboard a SpaceX rocket is more economical and that South Korea also needs more tests to ensure the reliability of a launch rocket.Earlier Monday, South Korea conducted a third test flight for a solid-fuel rocket near its southern Jeju island, according to the South’s Defense Ministry. A ministry statement said the launch was successful and put a civilian commercial satellite into orbit.Solid-fuel rockets require shorter launch times and cheaper development and manufacturing costs than liquid-fuel rockets. Experts say solid-fuel rockets are used to launch smaller spy satellite because they have weaker thrust force than similar-sized liquid-fuel rockets. They say the development of solid-fuel rockets can help improve South Korea’s missile technology as well.After the North Korean satellite launch, South Korea said it would resume frontline aerial surveillance in response. South Korea said North Korea reacted by restoring border guard posts. Both North and South Korean steps would breach their earlier agreement to ease military tensions along their border.",3292,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/north-korea-accuses-us-double-standards-letting-south-105351287,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/84dbfb7c-3f26-4cd9-9529-39d79801ca46/wirestory_0592cc5a555a5ec28604da21581ffd83_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,cover washington national base tragicomedy spacex question site council resolution additional post body cost south release aerospace state accuse ensure sanction connive peace resume send behavior global slam statement successful restore satellite ballistic put facility view seoul security standard breach manner strategic call development response jeju spokesperson strong sovereignty orbit irrevocable double improve militarily capability territory rebuke partner strike reliability agreement move liftoff island california defense commercial manufacturing key monitor north technology missile react force grave earlier photo maintains monday require small conduct space rival economical ease drew contract establishment weaker plan guard rocket illegal violate expose flight white korea border shorter thrust built network cheaper military unidentified show aerial tension vandenberg southern dependence domestically condemn korean time administration tolerate step aboard united frontline test launch world house enhance spy immediate imagery ministry include surveillance transmit denunciation civilian stability shameless logic accord exercise frantic friday expert pentagon,0.7212000000000001,0.2733900364520048,13.297028985507245,0.4073660714285714,0,2023-12-04

The identities of the remains have yet to be determined, the Air Force Special Operations Command said in a statement.On Nov. 29, the U.S. Air Force CV-22B Osprey from Yokota Air Base in Japan crashed near Yakushima island in southern Japan.

It is known for speed and flexibility, but its safety record has come under scrutiny in the aftermath of several deadly crashes.The deployment of the Ospreys has become controversial in Japan, with local residents and critics of the U.S. military presence raising safety concerns. The U.S. military’s Ospreys are assigned to Yokota Air Base in the western suburbs of Tokyo.The day after the crash, Tokyo suspended flights of its Osprey aircraft and asked the U.S. military to ground all non-emergency flights of its Ospreys operating in Japan until the crash is investigated and their flight safety can be confirmed. But the United States has continued operating them.“The main priority is bringing the Airmen home and taking care of their family members,” the statement read. “Support to, and the privacy of, the families and loved ones impacted by this incident remains AFSOC’s top priority.”Some pieces of the wreckage were collected by Japanese Coast Guard and fishermen and were handed over to the U.S. military, Japanese news outlet Kyodo News reported.Galliher, the identified crash victim, joined the U.S. Air Force in 2017, the Air Force said, calling him a “consummate intelligence professional and dedicated academic.” Galliher was a linguist specializing in Mandarin, according to the statement.“Jacob was a beloved husband, father, son, and brother as well as a model Airman who will be forever remembered for his dedication to this great nation and his fellow warriors,” U.S. Air Force Maj.

ABC,South Africa intercepts buses carrying more than 400 unaccompanied kids from Zimbabwe,2023-12-04 05:09:00,MOGOMOTSI MAGOME Associated Press,"JOHANNESBURG -- Border officials in South Africa say they have intercepted dozens of buses carrying more than 400 young children from Zimbabwe without parents or legal guardians in an anti-trafficking operation.The officials say the children were being “trafficked” into South Africa, although an organization representing foreign nationals living in South Africa says it's likely the children were being sent to visit their parents, who are working in South Africa, for the end of year holidays. The buses were sent back to Zimbabwe.More than 1 million Zimbabweans live in South Africa, many of them illegally, having moved to their southern neighbor over the past 15 years to escape Zimbabwe's economic turmoil.South African Border Management Agency commissioner Mike Masiapato said Sunday that South African police stopped and searched 42 buses entering from Zimbabwe on Saturday night and found 443 children under the age of 8 traveling unaccompanied.“We denied them entry and activated the Zimbabwean officials to process them back into Zimbabwe,” Masiapato said.The buses were allowed through on the Zimbabwean side of the Beitbridge border post, South African border officials said.Ngqabutho Mabhena, chairperson of the Africa Diaspora Forum, which represents foreign nationals living in South Africa, said his organization believed the buses were carrying Zimbabwean children coming to South Africa to visit their parents, which is a regular phenomenon near the end of the year. He said it is common that children are sent over the border without proper documentation allowing them to travel as unaccompanied minors.“We always tell Zimbabwean parents living in South Africa that if they arrange for their children to come to South Africa, they must ... arrange all necessary documentation,"" Mabhena said. “It is irresponsible for parents to let children travel without passports and to travel with strangers. We have addressed this with parents.""Around 178,000 Zimbabweans live and work in South Africa legally under an exemption permit, but a 2022 South African census said there were more than a million Zimbabweans in the country. Some estimates say there may be as many as 3 million.South Africa, which is Africa's most advanced economy, launched a new border force in October to clamp down on illegal immigration from Zimbabwe and other countries.___",2363,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-africa-intercepts-buses-carrying-400-unaccompanied-children-105351009,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,economy trafficked national stop enter south deny visit past diaspora masiapato africa documentation advanced clamp foreign live carry census permit common guardian zimbabwe believe exemption october back organization official illegally bus neighbor year police immigration dozen move represent arrange chairperson search johannesburg force unaccompanied proper mike country commissioner saturday entry side sunday travel economic night address mabhena young intercept illegal phenomenon border beitbridge holiday stranger million regular management estimate african escape activate parent living southern passport irresponsible age forum process zimbabwean launch work legally legal agency found child post,-0.52235,0.2539145154464663,13.286231155778893,0.3271320430411339,0,2023-12-04
Politico,Trudeau plays the Trump card,2023-12-04 05:00:00,Kyle Duggan,"OTTAWA — One name could dominate Canada’s next election: Donald Trump.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Liberal lawmakers are shifting into full-on attack mode, trying to use former President Trump’s MAGA brand to bludgeon his popular rival, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, as a hard-right populist out of sync with Canadian values.Not yet the official Republican nominee, Trump still casts a polarizing shadow on the global political landscape. In Canada, his name is like a swear word for the center-left, but also a useful tool.A Trump reelection bid could influence the timing of Canada’s next election or deal a wild card to the race, with the odds currently stacked heavily against Trudeau.“A second Trump presidency almost certainly creates a situation where the next election won’t be about Pierre Poilievre or Justin Trudeau — it will be about Donald Trump and Canada’s relationship with an America that is led by an angry, vengeful creature,” said Scott Reid, who worked in former Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin’s office.“I don’t know if that might benefit Poilievre or if it may benefit Justin Trudeau, but I think it is the kind of event that has the force to reset the next election in Canada.”Poilievre, a career politician, has fashioned himself as an outsider to the country’s political elite. When he won the party leadership in 2022, the Liberals did not bother to try to define him or launch a major ad campaign to slow his momentum — strange to many Canadian political insiders.These days, Trudeau’s Liberals keep repeating that Poilievre is “not worth the risk.” They say he’s “reckless” and “unhinged” with moves “straight out of the Republican playbook” in efforts to link him to the Trump arm of the party.They recently mashed up Trump and Poilievre clips in a compare-contrast video, showing both politicians attacking the press as fake news and going after woke censorship and political correctness.Reid says they are a year late to the punch. “If it’s a deliberate, conscious strategy — if they could pay for that paid media and they’ve decided not to — well, then that’s mind boggling and in my view an egregious strategic error.”Trudeau can trigger an election any time before the fall of 2025, so the U.S.-Canada election calendars could sync in a way that would plaster Trump across Canadian media in 2024.Canadians got a sampling of what that might be like during the past week.One moment that left no doubt about the strategy occurred when Trudeau attributed a Conservative vote against the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement to the “the rise of a right-wing American, MAGA-influence thinking that has made Canadian Conservatives, who used to be among the strongest defenders of Ukraine … turn their backs on something Ukraine needs in its hour of need.”The Conservatives said they were opposed to a carbon tax clause in the document, but Trudeau accused the lawmakers of “starting to parrot Russian disinformation and misinformation and propaganda.”The rhetoric dialed up.Liberal lawmaker Adam van Koeverden said in Parliament this week that “Canada’s support for Ukraine should have been unanimous in this House, but, just like Donald Trump, the leader of the Conservatives is cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.”Another Liberal lawmaker, Ken Hardie, was forced to apologize for controversially linking Poilievre and hard-right rhetoric to a shooting in Winnipeg that left four dead — aiming to draw a link between the unintended consequences from escalated rhetoric.Conservatives have a word for this: desperation. And they think the gambit will backfire when voters look at Trudeau’s record.Kory Teneycke, former communications director in former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s office, said the Liberals making Trump a proxy is a bad play.“They’re flailing around for arguments and ways to try to pull their numbers up and pull Poilievre’s down,” he said, and it doesn’t ring true.“The Conservative Party is leading with female voters, with new Canadian voters. It’s a party that embraces those new Canadians as opposed to having undertones of nativism and xenophobia. That’s why it doesn’t work.”On top of that, at least one poll found Poilievre is Canadians’ preferred leader to deal with a Trump presidency.“You want to find things that people agree with you on, and then turn the lens on those,” he said. “This is not a winning strategy.”Teneycke suggested Poilievre is probably closer to a Paul Ryan figure, as a more conventional conservative campaigning on lower taxes and personal freedom with more of a “libertarian complexion to many of his arguments.”Poilievre may not be that same “pure heroin” source of entertainment, bombast and astonishment, but there is some “hard right, populist appeal,” Reid said. “There are at least elements of the MAGA movement present in his message and methods.”They are playing the same cards, he adds. “It is anti-institution. It is challenging the establishment, both in real terms and in mythically exaggerated, self-serving bullshit terms. And it’s fundamentally autocratic strongman politics.”Alex Marland, a political science professor at Acadia University who researches political branding in Canada, says this marks a major turning point for Trudeau, who has spent much of his political career trying to emit “Obama-esque” positive energy and messaging to voters.“Trudeau has absolutely avoided going negative,” he said, instead getting “other people to be the ones to say negative things.”No longer.“Something is changing,” he said. “It tells you that through research, they’ve determined that this is the best line attack, their best communications approach against an opponent who is beating them, frankly, in the polls.”In past elections, he said, what the Liberals have done with their opponents is focus on domestic policy: social issues, gun control, abortion.Past polling shows Canadians have a distaste for Trump, after his presidency upended Canada’s historically strong relationship with the U.S. — when Trump tore up NAFTA — and Trudeau could position himself as standing up for the country’s interests.Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel Garner wrote this week that the emerging “boogeyman narrative” is the early stages of a “Hail-Mary election play,” and it appears the Liberals need Trump. “A MAGA-messaging-reliant Liberal campaign narrative with Justin Trudeau still at the helm has only one optimal window for an election: the October before a Biden vs Trump presidential election day.”But Supriya Dwivedi, senior counsel at Enterprise Canada, dismisses the idea.“If interest rates start to come down, if particularly grocery prices start to come down and folks aren’t seeing like C$4 for a head of mini lettuce anymore, then a lot of the anger you’re seeing and the disaffection will start to subside,” she said.She said in trying to define Poilievre, Trudeau should simply point to what he is saying and doing: The “constant demonization” of the free press, calling the prime minister a Marxist and making references to radical gender ideology.The compare/contrast with MAGA messaging would also actually have to stick to work — and a lot of that would hinge on what their opponents say in the future.“If there’s a drumbeat of certain messaging and catchphrases coming out of Donald Trump supporters that are finding their way into Canadian politics and are being emanated by conservatives, then there’s no question the Liberals are going to draw upon that and try and create this connection,” Marland said.“But if there’s totally different language going on, it becomes very hard.”",7629,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/04/trudeau-plays-the-trump-card-00129689,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/23ada1e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x5504+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc6%2Ffb%2Fe6cd18364f87a455915813cc5ba4%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1246139321,International

ABC,North Korean leader calls for women to have more children to halt a fall in birthrate,2023-12-04 03:56:00,KIM TONG-HYUNG Associated Press and HYUNG-JIN KIM Associated Press,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said it is a duty of women to halt a fall in the country’s births in order to strengthen national power, state media said Monday, as his government steps up the call for the people to have more children.While getting a detailed read on North Korea’s population trends is extremely difficult because of the limited statistics it discloses, South Korea’s government assesses that the North’s fertility rate has declined steadily for the past 10 years. That is a concerning development for a country that depends on mobilized labor to help keep its broken, heavily sanctioned economy afloat.Kim's latest appeal for women to have more children was made Sunday during the country’s National Mothers Meeting, the first of its kind in 11 years.“Stopping the decline in birthrates and providing good child care and education are all our family affairs that we should solve together with our mothers,"" Kim said in his opening speech.According to South Korea’s government statistics agency, North Korea’s total fertility rate, or the average number of babies expected to be born to a woman over her lifetime, was at 1.79 in 2022, down from 1.88 in 2014. The decline is still slower than its wealthier rival South Korea, whose fertility rate last year was 0.78, down from 1.20 in 2014.South Korea's fertility rate, the lowest in the developed world, is believed to be due to a potent cocktail of reasons discouraging people from having babies, including a decaying job market, a brutally competitive school environment for children, traditionally weak child care assistance and a male-centered corporate culture where many women find it impossible to combine careers and family.While North Korea is one of the poorest nations in the world, the change in its demographic structure is similar to that of rich countries, some observers say.“Many families in North Korea also don't intend to have more than one child these days as they know they need lots of money to raise their kids, send them to school and help them get jobs,” said Ahn Kyung-su, head of DPRKHEALTH.ORG, a website focusing on health issues in North Korea.Ahn, who has interviewed many North Korean defectors, said the smuggling of a vast amount of South Korean TV dramas and movies in the past 20 years that showed an elevated social status for women has also likely influenced women in North Korea not to have many children.North Korea implemented birth control programs in the 1970-80s to slow a postwar population growth. The country’s fertility rate recorded a major decline following a famine in the mid-1990s that was estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands of people, the Seoul-based Hyundai Research Institute said in a report in August.“Given North Korea lacks resources and technological advancements, it could face difficulties to revive and develop its manufacturing industry if sufficient labor forces are not provided,” the institute report said.According to North Korean state media reports this year, the country has introduced a set of benefits for families with three or more children, including preferential free housing arrangements, state subsidies, free food, medicine and household goods and educational perks for children.South Korea’s statistics agency estimates the North’s population at 25.7 million. The Hyundai institute report said that North Korea was expected to experience a population shrink from 2034 and forecast its population would decrease to 23.7 million by 2070.Ahn, the website head, said that Kim Jong Un's repeated public appearances with his young daughter, Ju Ae, are also likely be efforts to encourage families. Other experts said the daughter's appearances were more likely an attempt to show she's her father's heir.",3786,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/north-korean-leader-calls-women-children-halt-fall-105350640,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a1004d20-d23b-4984-b6ac-7a2520194b1a/wirestory_72d59d0e2c685549ba8cd8734d8a7fe2_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,economy sufficient observer drama national concern control developed brutally medium read technological social steadily south number population past opening woman solve send potent change meeting public research influence advancement hyundai daughter encourage seoul money similar thousand attempt introduce call interviewed make household leader growth power focus lack heavily assistance kid perk expect kind difficult impossible baby status force head country tv industry detailed movie give rival reason young rate set korea school mobilize affair day million poorest record government shrink labor born famine korean step provide combine late world weak educational lot intend heir agency repeat fertility strengthen father resource expert free discloses education issue stop nation average career state statistic halt sanction implement health duty institute discourage corporate housing believe demographic vast hundred development family depends raise broken environment ahn year wealthier extremely slow revive benefit appearance major amount manufacturing mother north forecast appeal defector preferential elevate total report culture birth monday sunday low structure limited job fall smuggle cocktail decay develop lifetime experience kill website decrease estimate show rich find medicine follow market jong difficulty arrangement decline competitive trend effort subsidy include food traditionally order due postwar program ass ae child birthrate,-0.04385,0.0792393026941362,11.215393586005831,0.5063263125763127,0,2023-12-04
ABC,Live updates | Israel’s military calls for more evacuations in southern Gaza as it widens offensive,2023-12-04 03:40:00,The Associated Press,"Israel's military called for more evacuations in southern Gaza as it widened its offensive aimed at eliminating the territory's Hamas rulers. The war has already killed thousands of Palestinians and displaced over three-fourths of Gaza's 2.3 million residents, who are running out of safe places to go.The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said the death toll in the territory since Oct. 7 has surpassed 15,500, with more than 41,000 wounded. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but said 70% of the dead were women and children.Israel says it targets Hamas operatives and blames civilian casualties on the militants, accusing them of operating in residential neighborhoods. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Israel says at least 81 of its soldiers have died.Hopes for another temporary truce faded after Israel called its negotiators home over the weekend. Hamas said talks on releasing more of the scores of hostages seized by Palestinian militants on Oct. 7 must be tied to a permanent cease-fire.The United States, along with Qatar and Egypt, which mediated the earlier cease-fire, say they are working on a longer truce.Currently:— 3 commercial ships hit by missiles in Houthi attack in Red Sea, US warship downs 3 drones— Biden’s allies in Senate demand that Israel limit civilian deaths in Gaza as Congress debates U.S. aid— Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-warHere’s what’s happening in the war:GENEVA — The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross is visiting Gaza in an effort to ease the conflict's “intolerable"" toll on civilians, the organization said Monday.ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric “will call for the protection of civilians in Gaza and respect for the laws of war. She will also reiterate the ICRC’s call for the hostages to be immediately released,” it said in a statement.“The level of human suffering is intolerable,"" Spoljaric said. “It is unacceptable that civilians have no safe place to go in Gaza, and with a military siege in place there is also no adequate humanitarian response currently possible.”The ICRC has been providing supplies to health care facilities and livelihood support for displaced people, the statement said. ICRC medical teams are also helping conduct surgeries at Gaza's European Hospital.“We have urgently appealed for civilian life to be protected and respected on all sides, in line with international humanitarian law, and I reiterate that appeal today,” Spoljaric said.ISTANBUL -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be put on trial for alleged war crimes just like former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.A vocal critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza, Erdogan once again referred to Netanyahu as the “butcher of Gaza.”“Netanyahu, the butcher of Gaza, is not only a war criminal, but he will definitely be tried as the butcher of Gaza, just like Milosevic was tried,” Erdogan said in a speech at a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul.The Israeli prime minister would need to be indicted by an international tribunal in order to stand trial for alleged war crimes. Milosevic was put on trial by a U.N. tribunal in The Hague on charges of fomenting bloody conflicts as Yugoslavia crumbled in the early 1990s. He died in his cell before the court could reach a verdict.Erdogan also renewed his criticism of the United Nations system, accusing the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council of blocking efforts to end the violence.“On the one side, there are 121 countries that say ‘stop the war’ and ‘no more bloodshed,’ and on the other side, there are three or five countries that give carte blanche to Israel’s attacks,” Erdogan said.THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Human rights lawyers went to court in the Netherlands on Monday calling for a halt to the export of fighter jet parts to Israel that could be used in attacks on Gaza.The rights organizations say that delivery of parts for F-35 jets makes the Netherlands complicit in possible war crimes by Israel in its war with Hamas.The civil case in The Hague opened as the Israeli military renewed calls for mass evacuations from the southern town of Khan Younis, where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge in recent weeks, as it widened its ground offensive and bombarded targets across the Gaza Strip.The rights lawyers want The Hague District Court to issue an injunction banning exports of F-35 parts that are stored in a warehouse in the town of Woensdrecht.“The state must immediately stop its delivery of F-35 parts to Israel,” lawyer Liesbeth Zegveld told the court.She said Dutch customs officials asked the government if it wanted to continue exports after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas that triggered the Israel-Hamas war.“The warning that the fighter jets can contribute to serious breaches of the laws of war does not, for the (Dutch) state outweigh its economic interests and diplomatic reputation,” she said.Government lawyer Reimer Veldhuis urged the court’s single judge to reject the injunction, saying that even if it were to uphold the rights lawyers’ legal arguments and ban exports, “the United States would deliver these parts to Israel from another place.”A decision is expected within two weeks. It can be appealed.TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial has resumed after a hiatus prompted by the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and the war it set off.Netanyahu is on trial for alleged fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases involving powerful media moguls and wealthy associates. He denies any wrongdoing.In Monday's hearing, police investigators will be questioned over allegations that Netanyahu promoted regulatory benefits for a telecom company in exchange for favorable coverage from a news outlet it owned.Netanyahu’s lengthy trial, which began in 2020, was paused after the Hamas attack, when the country’s courts were put under emergency status and all but shut down. The last hearing took place at the end of September.TEL AVIV, Israel — The head of Israel’s domestic security agency, Shin Bet, says his organization is prepared to destroy Hamas “in every place,” including in other Middle Eastern countries.The remarks by Ronen Bar, aired late Sunday by Israel’s public broadcaster Kan, echoed similar comments by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister last month.“In every place, in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Turkey, in Qatar, everywhere,” Bar said in an audio recording. “It’ll take a few years but we will be there to do it.”Bar compared the mission to Israel’s operation to assassinate militants behind the 1972 killings of members of its Olympic team in Munich, Germany.Kan did not say when Bar made the remarks.Most of Hamas’ top leadership lives in exile, primarily in the Gulf state of Qatar, a key player in bringing about the recently expired truce between Israel and Hamas, and the Lebanese capital of Beirut.Israel’ Mossad spy agency has been accused of involvement in a series of assassinations overseas of Palestinian militants and Iranian nuclear scientists over the years.TEL AVIV, Israel — Freed from Hamas captivity, several young Israelis are doing what young people do and are posting to TikTok.Dancing, keeping up with trends or just thanking their followers, several young Israelis have begun appearing on social media just days after they were freed.Alma Or, 13, who was released after 50 days in captivity, posted a video in which she dances with a friend under the text “Roses are red this trend might be over but I’ve just been freed from Hamas captivity.”Sahar Kalderon, 16, posted a video of herself and a friend dancing to a beat-infused track in front of a mirror, under text reading “The sound that crossed though my head the moment I came home from captivity.”Another freed captive, Gali Tarshansky, 13, has posted at least two videos since being freed, with one captioned “Captives humor.”Under a now-expired truce deal, Hamas released 105 Israeli and foreign captives it snatched on Oct. 7. Most returned physically well but doctors have cautioned it will take time for them to heal emotionally from their weeks in captivity. Four other hostages were released before the truce and one was rescued.JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it has expanded its ground operation against the Hamas militant group to “every part” of the Gaza Strip.The army resumed its offensive on Friday after a weeklong cease-fire expired. After focusing its ground operation on the northern part of Gaza in recent weeks, it began carrying out airstrikes in southern Gaza as well. The vast majority of Gaza’s population has fled to the south in search of safety.Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said late Sunday that ground troops were also pushing into the south.“The Israeli army is continuing and expanding the ground operation against the Hamas presence in every part of the Gaza Strip,” he said.LONDON — The British government said its military plans to fly unarmed surveillance drones over the Gaza Strip in search of hostages taken by Hamas.The Ministry of Defense said the flights will not have a combat role and the only information passed on will be for the purpose of rescuing hostages still held since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.The fate of the hostages, including British nationals, has been a key concern as a weeklong cease-fire ended Friday and Israel began a new round of bombardments. During the break in fighting, Hamas released 110 hostages but another 137 remain captive, Israel said.“Having had around 100 hostages released, there are still many more who are being held captive by Hamas,” Health Secretary Victoria Atkins told Sky News on Sunday. “We want to do everything we can to help find those hostages and to secure their release.”Atkins said unmanned drones will be used to conduct the surveillance.ROME — An Italian naval ship, anchored off Egypt on Sunday, has received its first patient as part of the Italian government’s commitment to care for civilians needing medical assistance in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.The Italian defense ministry, in a post on social medium platform X, quoted Defense Minister Guido Crosetto as saying that a girl was the first person to receive treatment aboard the ship, Vulcano. No details were given about her medical condition.The ship’s facilities include operating rooms.VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has called the end of the truce in the Israel-Hamas “painful.”“That means death, destruction and misery,” the pontiff said on Sunday in remarks read for him by an aide because he has bronchitis.The pope, noting that many hostages are still held in Gaza, said “Let’s think of them, of their families, who had seen a light, a hope of embracing again their loved ones.”He also lamented the lack of basic necessities of life in Gaza. “I hope that all who are involved can reach as soon as possible a new accord for a cease-fire and find solutions that are different than weapons, trying to follow courageous paths of peace.”DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said Israel in its war with Hamas “must do more to protect innocent civilians.”The vice president noted in remarks to reporters at the United Nations climate conference that Israel is within its rights to defend itself after the brutal Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, yet the U.S. ally must do so in accordance with international law.",11622,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/live-updates-israels-military-calls-evacuations-southern-gaza-105350460,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/4bcb4284-7714-479d-b670-aa8c836f6dd7/wirestory_18750a62ef610f47f5937cc3c7b02a99_16x9.jpg?w=992,International

ABC,Magnitude 5.1 earthquake shakes northwest Turkey.

CNN,‘I wont return’: Hong Kong democracy activist Agnes Chow reveals she has moved to Canada and plans to skip bail,2023-12-04 02:54:00,Nectar Gan,"One of the most prominent faces of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement revealed Sunday that she is living in Canada and will not return to meet bail conditions as police investigate allegations she endangered national security.Agnes Chow, a former student activist and politician, broke more than two years of public silence in a social media post on her 27th birthday, announcing she had left Hong Kong for studies in Canada in September – and that she will not return to Hong Kong later this month to report to police as required.“Probably I won’t return for the rest of my life,” she said in a post on Instagram.Chow, who was sentenced to 10 months in prison in 2020 for taking part in Hong Kong’s mass anti-government protests the previous year, was bailed by police in a separate case upon her release in 2021 on suspicion of “colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security.”She had her passport confiscated, was ordered to regularly report to police and had kept a low profile since.In her Instagram post, Chow said she decided to flee after “considering the situation in Hong Kong, my personal safety, my physical and mental health,” adding that she had faced sustained pressure from authorities.She said her passport was only returned to her after she agreed to travel in August on a police-organized trip to mainland China to learn about the country’s development.Chow said she received permission from Hong Kong authorities to pursue her master’s degree in Canada, on the condition that she returned to Hong Kong to report to police during school breaks.In a statement Monday, Hong Kong police condemned Chow’s plans to skip bail as “irresponsible behaviors that blatantly challenge law and order.”“Police urge the relevant individual to step back from the brink, refrain from choosing the path of no return and carrying the label of ‘fugitive’ for the rest of her life,” the police statement said.Chow cofounded the pro-democracy Hong Kong political party Demosisto in 2016 with fellow activists Joshua Wong and Nathan Law when they were students. Demosisto was disbanded on June 30, 2020, the same day Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on the semi-autonomous city.Chow was among the first pro-democracy leaders to be detained under the law in Hong Kong. Wong is currently behind bars, while Law is in self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom.Critics say the law has wiped out opposition to the government and curtailed political freedoms in the once outspoken city. The Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied the legislation is suppressing freedoms and insisted the law has “restored stability” to the city following the 2019 protests.In her Instagram post, Chow said she was admitted by a university in Toronto earlier this year. But as a condition to get her passport back from police, she had to travel in August with authorities to the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong.Under the escort of five national security police officers, Chow said she was taken to an exhibition highlighting China’s achievements since its reform and opening in the late 1970s, and the headquarters of tech giant Tencent to understand “the motherland’s technological development” – where she was required to pose for photos, according to her post.“I felt as if I was under surveillance the whole time,” she wrote, citing whispers between police officers and staff members behind her back and requests for her to pose for photos.She also said she was required to write an appreciation letter to “thank the police” for organizing the trip and allowing her to “understand the great development of the motherland.”“To be honest, I have never denied China’s economic development. But such a powerful country is sending people who fight for democracy to prison, restricting their freedom of entering and leaving the country, and imposing visits to mainland China for patriotic exhibitions as an exchange for getting their passports back – isn’t this a show of vulnerability?” she wrote.The Hong Kong police statement on Chow confirmed they had returned her passport to allow her to study overseas and prolonged her bail. It did not address Chow’s account of the trip to Shenzhen.Chow also recounted the mental toll that strict bail conditions had taken on her over more than two years.Every three months, Chow had to sign a notice extending the confiscation of her passport. She was also ordered to report regularly to police about her income, work, family and personal relationships, Chow wrote on Instagram.“It was as if someone wanted to remind me every once in a while: you have not regained your freedom, you’re still under surveillance, don’t try to do anything,” she wrote.Chow said every time she reported to the police, she was fearful of being rearrested.She had been diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, she said, adding her mental and physical state reached a low point this year, prompting her to apply for graduate school in Canada.Chow said she gained permission to leave after providing the national security police details of her program and writing a requested “letter of repentance.” In the letter, she stated regretted her past political activities and pledged that she will never participate in politics or meet her fellow activists again.“Over the past few years, I have experienced first-hand how precious freedom from fear is,” Chow wrote. “Freedom is hard to come by. In my daily life of fear, I cherish all the people who have not forgotten me, who care about me and love me even more. Hope we can reunite in the near future and give each other a good embrace.”",5685,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/asia/agnes-chow-canada-skip-bail-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231026160351-nectar-gan-medium-shot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,detain sunday living felt canada report decide regularly confiscate august tech country overseas reunite strict appreciation detail social border mental powerful law political learn confirm notice probably democracy depression earlier prolong legislation anxiety previous confiscation bail embrace sign account disband opposition diagnose beijing pursue stability back restrict receive individual precious security hard sweep cherish skip surveillance photo united hope point escort freedom irresponsible stress birthday technological participate collude motherland june return reach impose member national require trip activity sustain agree regain party force relationship school giant health leader authority police rest left september visit toll part release repeatedly reform situation work broke deny pose degree refrain experienced leave currently state path low follow exile pressure chow show wipe write statement enter travel safety admit curtail forgotten mass bar carry monday relevant whisper student protest passport foreign achievement movement plan politician announce fugitive condition former exchange study give time label nathan public cofounded consider late future officer exhibition graduate demosisto behavior post meet activist extend permission restore tencent address step patriotic love fearful master kong economic choose opening personal condemn endanger joshua insist add month allegation staff request honest urge suspicion provide flee city accord fear past prompt reveal china regret separate highlight profile prominent prison sentence case challenge headquarters understand day year recount apply physical disorder silence remind blatantly family letter politics chinese university order hong shenzhen daily organize income program government life vulnerability development fight mainland fellow great medium investigate send pledge instagram brink toronto outspoken suppress,0.7517499999999999,0.4221635883905013,10.423605313092978,0.3764215942787372,0,2023-12-04
ABC,Israel orders evacuations as it widens offensive but Palestinians are running out of places to go,2023-12-04 02:49:00,WAFAA SHURAFA Associated Press and SAMY MAGDY Associated Press,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israel's military renewed calls Monday for mass evacuations from the southern town of Khan Younis, where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge in recent weeks, as it widened its ground offensive and bombarded targets across the Gaza Strip.The expanded operations, following the expiration of a weeklong cease-fire, are aimed at eliminating Gaza's Hamas rulers, whose Oct. 7 attack into Israel triggered the deadliest Israeli-Palestinian violence in decades. The war has already killed thousands of Palestinians and displaced over three-fourths of the territory's population of 2.3 million people, who are running out of safe places to go.Already under mounting pressure from its top ally, the United States, Israel appears to be racing to strike a death blow against Hamas — if that’s possible, given the group’s deep roots in Palestinian society — before any new cease-fire. But the mounting toll of the fighting, which Palestinian health officials say has killed several hundred civilians since the truce ended on Friday, is likely to further increase international pressure to return to the negotiating table.It could also render even larger parts of the isolated territory uninhabitable.Airstrikes and the ground offensive have transformed much of the north, including large areas in Gaza City, into a rubble-filled wasteland. Around 2 million people are now crowded into the 230 square kilometers (90 square miles) that make up Gaza’s south, where Israel’s focus is starting to shift.As Israel calls for more areas to be evacuated, it’s not clear where people can go. Already shelters are overwhelmed, and both Israel and neighboring Egypt have refused to accept any refugees.Residents said Monday they heard airstrikes and explosions in and around Khan Younis overnight after the military dropped leaflets warning people to relocate farther south toward the border with Egypt. The military has ordered the evacuation of nearly two dozen neighborhoods in and around the town.Later in the day, the military warned civilians to avoid the main north-south highway between Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah, saying the road had become a “battlefield” and was “extremely dangerous.” That indicated Israeli troops were approaching Khan Younis from the northeast, possibly with plans to cut central Gaza off from the south.Al-Jazeera television aired footage of medics rescuing people wounded by what appeared to have been a strike on a car on that stretch of highway. An Israeli tank could be seen just up the road.Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, said the army is pursuing Hamas with “maximum force” in the north and south, and said it was trying to minimize harm to civilians.He pointed to a map that divides southern Gaza into dozens of blocks in order to give “precise instructions” to residents on where to evacuate.Many Palestinians, however, have ignored past evacuation orders, saying they do not feel any safer in the areas where they are told to seek refuge — which have also been repeatedly bombed. The military has meanwhile barred those who fled the north from returning, even during the cease-fire.“The level of human suffering is intolerable,” Mirjana Spoljaric, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said during a rare visit to Gaza. She also called for the immediate release of scores of hostages captured by Palestinian militants during the Oct. 7 attack.“It is unacceptable that civilians have no safe place to go in Gaza, and with a military siege in place there is also no adequate humanitarian response currently possible.”The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said the death toll in the territory since Oct. 7 has surpassed 15,500, with more than 41,000 wounded. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but said 70% of the dead were women and children.A Health Ministry spokesman asserted that hundreds had been killed or wounded since the cease-fire ended early Friday. “The majority of victims are still under the rubble,” Ashraf al-Qidra said.The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received 32 bodies overnight after Israeli strikes across central Gaza, said Omar al-Darawi, an administrative employee. Associated Press footage showed women in tears, kneeling over the bodies of loved ones and kissing them.The military said aircraft struck some 200 Hamas targets overnight, with ground troops operating “in parallel,” without elaborating. It said troops in northern Gaza uncovered a militant hideout in a school after coming under attack. Inside, they found two tunnel shafts, one of which had been booby-trapped, as well as explosives and weapons, the military said.It is not possible to independently confirm battlefield reports from either side.Israel says it targets Hamas operatives, not civilians, and blames civilian casualties on the militants, accusing them of operating in residential neighborhoods.It adds that it takes measures to protect civilians. In addition to leaflets dropped over Gaza, the military has used phone calls and radio and TV broadcasts to urge people to move from specific areas.Israel claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Israel says at least 81 of its soldiers have been killed.The U.S. is pressing Israel to avoid more mass displacements and the killing of civilians, a message underscored by Vice President Kamala Harris during a visit to the region. She also said the U.S. would not allow the forced relocation of Palestinians out of Gaza or the occupied West Bank, or the redrawing of Gaza's borders.But it’s unclear how far the Biden administration is willing or able to go in pressing Israel to rein in the offensive, even as the White House faces growing pressure from its allies in Congress.The U.S. has pledged unwavering support to Israel since the Oct. 7 attack, which killed over 1,200 people, mostly civilians, including rushing munitions and other aid to Israel.Israel has rejected U.S. suggestions that control over postwar Gaza be handed over to the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority as part of renewed efforts to resolve the overall conflict by establishing a Palestinian state.Hopes for another temporary truce faded after Israel called its negotiators home over the weekend. Hamas said talks on releasing any more of the scores of hostages seized by Palestinian militants on Oct. 7 must be tied to a permanent cease-fire.The earlier truce facilitated the release of 105 of the roughly 240 Israeli and foreign hostages taken to Gaza during the Oct. 7 attack, and the release of 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Most of those released by both sides were women and children.___Magdy reported from Cairo.___",6800,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israel-orders-mass-evacuations-widens-offensive-palestinians-running-105350354,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/666b9dd8-6db3-43cf-8507-4825e964a09a/wirestory_ece85568ce36cb2315f26b10adda30fa_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,confirm central highway hamas transform broadcast control trigger large television explosive suffer isolated body south kilometer leaflet visit ally casualty target population past bombed renew assert woman adequate feel return mount stretch foreign independently human authority operative top tear widen thousand ten grow call deadliest make displacement rein official focus establish internationally mile israel deep neighbor air approach early relocate pressure aid dozen strip victim tie avoid fade blame indicate shaft underscored elaborate sought force earlier vice pledge weekend administrative tv kiss cut side give shelter pursue clear harm violence army plan point recognize week militant overnight surpass urge egypt displace mass run school million day siege ashraf biden troop possible start drop struck president inside resolve capture warn administration provide parallel radio hospital ministry talk aircraft level civilian increase battlefield attack hand explosion imprison spokesman differentiate part seize unwavering possibly committee found expand khan residential cross deir unacceptable munition resident death measure region car combatant northern rush reject hostage palestinian majority kneel evacuation tunnel accept release state specific city render accuse heard associate red protect group health northeast place wasteland spoljaric airstrikes seek repeatedly crowd evidence younis ruler operating ignore hundred society home aim root square safer response neighborhood negotiator blow receive expiration message fight harris gaza offensive race bombard phone daniel redrawing soldier extremely territory strike rubble move temporary conflict recent humanitarian israeli north area medic add omar block international love roughly maximum report safe score bank unclear monday rescue map press relocation negotiate currently rare weeklong support truce road refuge tank permanent white kill border bar facilitate overwhelmed town farther decade military refuse precise evacuate show wound martyr hideout southern toll follow mirjana footage united weapon west eliminate divide effort immediate house include told flee ground employee order kamala occupy instruction addition minimize hagari operation intolerable dead claim postwar friday uncovered suggestion,-0.9926,0.3970588235294118,12.37281223449448,0.3299755439365829,0,2023-12-04

NPR,11 bodies recovered after Indonesia volcanic eruption as 12 climbers remain missing,2023-12-04 02:38:00,The Associated Press,"PADANG, Indonesia â€” The bodies of 11 climbers were recovered Monday a day after a furious eruption of the Mount Marapi volcano as Indonesian rescuers searched for 12 apparently still missing. Marapi has stayed at the third highest of four alert levels since 2011, a level indicating above normal volcanic activity and prohibiting climbers or villagers within 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) of the peak, said Hendra Gunawan, the head of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation. ""This means that there should be no climbing to the peak,"" Gunawan said, adding that climbers were only allowed below the danger zone, ""but sometimes many of them broke the rules to fulfill their satisfaction to climb further."" About 75 climbers had started their way up the nearly 2,900-meter (9,480-foot) mountain on Saturday and became stranded. Eight of those rescued Sunday were rushed to hospitals with burns and one also had a broken limb, said Hari Agustian, an official at the local Search and Rescue Agency in Padang, the West Sumatra provincial capital. All of the climbers had registered at two command posts or online through West Sumatra's conservation agency before they climbed, Agustian said. It was possible others took illegal roads or local residents were active in the area, but it couldn't be confirmed, he said. Marapi spewed thick columns of ash as high as 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) in Sunday's eruption and hot ash clouds spread several miles (kilometers). Nearby villages and towns were blanketed by tons of volcanic debris. Volcanic dust and rain smeared the faces and hair of evacuated climbers, according to video on social media. Falling ash blanketed several villages and blocked sunlight, and authorities distributed masks and urged residents to wear eyeglasses to protect them from volcanic ash. About 1,400 people live on Marapi's slopes in Rubai and Gobah Cumantiang, the nearest villages about 5 to 6 kilometers (3.1 to 3.7 miles) from the peak. Gunawan said that Sunday's eruption was not preceded by a significant increase in volcanic earthquakes. Deep volcanic earthquakes were only recorded three times between Nov. 16 and on Sunday, while the deformation equipment or tiltmeter on the peak showed a horizontal pattern on the radial axis and a slight inflation on the tangential axis. ""This shows that the eruption process is taking place quickly and the center of pressure is very shallow, around the peak,"" he said. Marapi has been observed regularly erupting since 2004 with a gap of 2 to 4 years, Gunawan said. ""Marapi eruptions are always sudden and difficult to detect using equipment because the source is near the surface,"" Gunawan said, ""This eruption was not caused by the movement of magma."" West Sumatra's Search and Rescue Agency head Abdul Malik said rescuers found 11 bodies of climbers as they searched for those who still missing and rescued three others Monday morning. ""The evacuation process of the bodies and survivors are still ongoing,"" he said, adding that rescuers are still searching for 12 climbers reportedly still missing. Marapi has been active since a January eruption that caused no casualties. It is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.",3370,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216888001/11-bodies-recovered-after-indonesia-volcanic-eruption-as-12-climbers-remain-miss,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2022/08/17/gp_arm-15_sq-ce24f5ccde64ad06e7751452e6453ff099c71856-s100-c15.jpg,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,confirm seismic surface indonesian center rush spread medium social blanket resident local spew body prohibit inflation evacuation kilometer sunlight casualty padang debris morning fault meter protect line fulfill volcano equipment mount eyeglass place ongoing live gobah authority village command hendra alert smear villager location foot furious recover ash tiltmeter malik official mile agustian miss deep rubai detect video tangential broken year rule activity horizontal pressure geological provincial stayed difficult indicate pattern high precede mitigation search add area distribute arc block fire erupt abdul nearby axis climber head hot active gap saturday significant monday rescue shallow sunday earthquake prone online fall volcanology normal climb gunawan mask road observe climbed volcanic quickly illegal urge encircle survivor january town danger deformation day source strand pacific evacuate disaster record possible start show column wear cloud rescuer hair indonesia dust mountain upheaval register time slope basin process hospital west zone apparently broke sumatra radial ring satisfaction level increase due peak capital reportedly agency thick conservation slight eruption accord found regularly marapi burn rain cumantiang magma limb movement sudden post,-0.4628,0.1780415430267062,9.854888178913736,0.4250062539086929,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Why the Islamic State is surging in Africa,2023-12-04 02:00:00,Rachel Chason,"DAKAR, Senegal — An African branch of the Islamic State that for years was an afterthought for the main organization is surging in strength, expanding the ranks of its fighters and controlling more territory than at any point since its founding in 2015, researchers say, part of a shift by the Islamic State from its traditional strongholds in Iraq and Syria to Africa.Experts say the Islamic State-Sahel Province is ascendant in parts of Mali and Niger and, to a lesser extent, Burkina Faso, because of the security vacuum created by a drawdown of Western military assistance, most notably the departure of French soldiers — who were forced to end their missions by junta leaders — and the closing of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali this year.Another factor has been decisions made by the Islamic State’s rival group, the substantially larger al-Qaeda-affiliated Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), to focus its resources elsewhere after battlefield losses to the IS Sahel, essentially ceding vast tracts of land near the border between Mali and Niger.After earning a reputation for brutality and indiscriminate violence, the Islamic State branch is now focusing more on governance in the towns and villages it controls, analysts said, and committing fewer atrocities against civilians.“There is more organization in terms of indoctrination and recruitment,” said Guillaume Soto-Mayor, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute. “And there are some types of violence that they now appear reluctant to use. They are showing off as a governing force.”Soto-Mayor said that it is only recently that he has begun to hear of entire communities opting to join the Islamic State, some attracted by the imposition of strict sharia Islamic law in territories where governance is otherwise lacking and others because they lack the resources to move and rebuild their lives elsewhere. He said that as the group has grown, so too have its internal structures, including the number of schools where the next generation of soldiers are trained.Since the death of Islamic State emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019, the organization has increasingly focused on its African provinces, including its branches in Somalia, the Democratic of Republic of Congo, around Lake Chad and elsewhere in the Sahel region, which cuts across the continent below the Sahara Desert.Researchers say that the Islamic State Sahel Province — which counted just a few dozen combatants when the group’s founder Abu Walid al-Sahrawi pledged allegiance to Baghdadi in 2015 — has in the past few years begun to receive more attention from the Islamic State headquarters. Current estimates by researchers put the number of combatants at several thousand.The Islamic State is “definitely more active in the Sahel and pulling off more attacks — both low and high-profile ones” than in Iraq and Syria, said Caleb Weiss, a senior analyst with the Bridgeway Foundation who is focused on Islamic State affiliates in Africa, although he cautioned that much of the Islamic State’s activity in the Middle East is underreported by the group or carried out in the shadows.Weiss said that fighting between the Islamic State and JNIM, which is al-Qaeda affiliated, is the main factor constraining their growth. “It is a weird world — to counter the Islamic State, we rely on al-Qaeda,” said Weiss, adding that it is “JNIM who would provide the bulwark against any IS expansion, and vice versa.” And JNIM has other priorities, he noted, including in central Mali and pushing southward toward the coastal states of Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo and Ghana.In the past year, the Islamic State has “expanded significantly” in areas around Gao and Ménaka in Mali, where JNIM and other armed groups had been dominant, said Héni Nsaibia, a senior researcher with the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. Nsaibia said that battles between IS Sahel and JNIM have decreased since July, following successive conflicts in which IS Sahel came out victorious. “They realized that they faced common challenges and fighting was detrimental to each other,” he said, adding that the pause is probably temporary.",4162,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/01/islamic-state-sahel-africa/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,middle central control congo large earn weird walid essentially southward jamaat sahara number brutality past arm strict detrimental wei africa guillaume note carry dakar put extent reputation common nsaibia rebuild current push organization make event islamic leader growth focus bridgeway expansion attention western foundation jnim lack assistance constrain dozen allegiance law surge founder commit indoctrination peacekeeping dominant iraq force pledge vice governance cut senior govern rival rely violence point land counter emir imposition coastal entire drawdown life pull stronghold mali french school underreported afterthought probably successive atrocity affiliate begin headquarters grown departure lesser strength provide join world niger factor battlefield opt definitely attack community part found expand resource count increasingly sahel death region realize combatant sharia burkina analyst indiscriminate province branch state project continent recently group benin caleb togo coast institute fighter closing reluctant village location security ivory notably significantly july mission vast cede héni receive challenge fight term year lake soldier junta pause activity territory move temporary conflict vacuum add area abu ménaka senegal data active chad recruitment caution nonresident low victorious structure bulwark decision hear battle border scholar researcher create town republic military decrease estimate african show traditional syria somalia type generation priority follow baghdadi loss gao internal rank tract include bakr east substantially shift faso ascendant attract democratic nusrat,-0.8388500000000001,0.0,11.54815612382234,0.3550347222222222,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Police raid gay venues in Russia after top court bans ‘international LGBTQ movement’,2023-12-04 01:07:00,not specified,"Police carried out raids on gay venues in Russia late Friday, two online Russian news outlets reported, one day after the country’s top court ruled to ban the “international LGBTQ movement” and labelled it an extremist organization.Thursday’s landmark ruling by the Supreme Court sent a fresh shiver of fear through Russia’s LGBTQ community, who have already faced an intensifying crackdown in recent years, as President Vladimir Putin seeks to shore up his image as defender of traditional moral values against the liberal West.The raids took place in at least three entertainment venues in the capital Moscow, according to the two independent Russian Telegram news outlets, Ostorozhno Novosti and Sota.Police said they were conducting routine drug raids, the outlets added.Ostorozhno Moskva also reported that police photographed the passports of partygoers.“Eyewitnesses said that security forces entered the premises under the pretext of an anti-drug check and photographed visitors’ passports,” it said. “In the middle of the party, they stopped the music and (the police) started entering the halls.”The outlet also posted video of an eyewitness describing a fearful scene: “I was there. I honestly sh** myself when the music stopped and they said there was a police raid. I thought that was it, I would be imprisoned for 12 years. On the way out they took a photo of my passport (ID). So you understand, 300 of us stood naked, in only underwear, and waited for somebody to bring us clothes, and no one understood what was happening.”Independent Telegram news channel Sota, citing an employee of the gay club Central Station in Moscow, reported the raids happened at the Secret Club and the Mono Bar in Moscow, as well as at the popular pop-up Hunters Party.Sota also reported that the Central Station Club in St. Petersburg announced its closure on Friday, saying the club’s management said that they were denied further rental of the site due to the “new law.”Video posted by the two news outlets show a police van parked outside what appears to be one of the venues with flashing lights but no sirens. At least two people who appear to be police officers can be seen at the entrance of the venue.Well-known Russian transgender blogger and LGBTQ activist Milana Petrova – who is no longer living in the country – posted about the raids on her Telegram channel.She said the raids were on private LGBTQ parties, not nightclubs.“There were NO raids there yesterday. There were raids on individual LGBT parties for adults. There, people’s passports were photographed without their will, apparently for further repression,” Petrova posted on Sunday.“Let me remind you that the law came out the day before yesterday,” Petrova said. “Never in the history of the country have there been such cruel laws,” she added.The manager of the popular Mono gay club, who goes by the name Alexey Khoroshy, denied reports his club was raided. Khoroshy said only the pop-up party in Moscow was raided.“Yesterday was the only drug raid at Hunters Party. So, everything is calm as before - we are working! And remember that drugs are evil!” Khoroshy said.Another source with direct knowledge of the raid on the Hunters Party pop-up told CNN it was just a routine drug raid.However, people chatting on an online group linked to the Hunters Party expressed their fear.“No one will be at peace anymore, we are now balancing between propaganda and extremism,” posted one person directly linked to the Hunters Party on the group chat.Another person responded: “It is dangerous, I won’t go anymore.”Russian officials have not commented on the raids. There was no mention of routine drug or any other type of raids on state-run media.Russia’s LGBTQ community have already faced a host of new laws that specifically target them.Late last year Putin signed into law a bill that expands a ban on so-called LGBTQ “propaganda” in Russia, making it illegal for anyone to promote same-sex relationships or suggest that non-heterosexual orientations are “normal.”The ban was rubber-stamped by Putin just days after a harsh new “foreign agents” law came into effect, as the Kremlin cracks down on free speech and human rights as its military operation in Ukraine falters.The new laws significantly broaden the scope of a 2013 law which banned the dissemination of LGBTQ-related information to minors. The new iteration extends the ban on promoting such information to adults as well.It is now illegal in Russia to promote or “praise” LGBTQ relationships, publicly express non-heterosexual orientations or suggest that they are “normal.”",4605,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/europe/police-raid-gay-venues-russia-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204101957-lgbt-russia-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,living report clothes private link transgender country naked defender cnn type propaganda law rule central intensify make seek agent capital express management hunter iteration park image sign russia respond individual military free telegram ukraine shore security official closure photo specifically dissemination club extremist mono evil normal crackdown repression online sh anymore knowledge entrance liberal describe bill scope party force relationship wait secret employee blogger police stop group due ban work target imprison deny moskva mention illegal petrova routine praise told news information direct show raid broaden pretext shiver enter peace yesterday petersburg host alexey independent start community middle remember bar carry understood happen supreme passport foreign person visitor russian movement harsh calm source chat photograph popular announce station longer history crack novosti minor label stood directly late international light landmark ruling rental officer orientation bring extremism comment post id activist putin top value president cruel fearful site apparently friday dangerous promote manager entertainment gay conduct fresh channel human honestly accord place fear khoroshy effect video understand day lgbtq year siren court premise remind outlet moscow publicly suggest significantly eyewitness music ostorozhno kremlin check lgbt underwear expands venue balance milana vladimir traditional operation adult flash scene extends speech recent,0.0886499999999999,0.6514657980456025,10.082186046511628,0.4578780226507498,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Young Palestinian prisoners describe harsh treatment in Israeli jails,2023-12-04 01:00:00,Steve Hendrix,"JERUSALEM — On his 17th birthday, Noah Bseso got a surprise: He was taken from the cell he shared with eight other young Palestinians at Israel’s Damon Prison. Fingerprinted and photographed, he wondered if he was in for an unexpected transfer.He had heard nothing of the agreement to exchange Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages held in Gaza. He didn’t know that his father was on his way to meet him, or that his mother was hurriedly hanging the birthday streamers they hadn’t thought they’d need.Within hours, he was home, and free.Bseso sat in his family’s living room Thursday, still reeling from finding himself one of the 240 Palestinians released from Israeli custody during the seven-day pause in the Gaza war. Like the more than 100 Israeli hostages and foreign citizens freed by Hamas before fighting resumed Friday, the Palestinian detainees knew less than almost anyone about the diplomatic maneuvering in which they had been pawns.They have emerged to learn the details of the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel. They’ve learned of the Israeli military campaign that has killed more than 15,500 people and wounded more than 41,000 in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.Bseso, a skinny high school math whiz, was detained for three months. He spent some of his days in windowless solitary confinement.“I wasn’t aware of anything,” he said. “Sometimes I didn’t know whether it was daytime or nighttime.”The Palestinians released were women and teens. Some, like Bseso, were charged with offenses such as throwing rocks, fireworks or molotov cocktails at Israeli troops during raids on Palestinian towns. Almost half were boys ages 14 to 17. Several emerged with stories of deprivation and, in some cases, physical abuse.Several dozen of the prisoners were swept up in the surge of arrests in the West Bank that followed Oct. 7, though most had been held for longer. Israel has refused to release prisoners charged with murder or other major crimes.Palestinians in the West Bank are tried in Israeli military courts, where conviction rates approach 100 percent, according to the United Nations. The majority of those freed last week had never been convicted of a crime; many had never had a day in court. Israel’s practice of administrative detention allows Palestinian detainees to be held for months or years without trial or charge.Use of administrative detention, long criticized by rights groups, “dramatically increased” this year, according to Amnesty International, especially after Oct. 7.On his second morning of freedom, Bseso sat in the living room beneath a “17” balloon, noticeably thinner in life than in the photos that hung on the wall. He fingered a set of prayer beads. His gaze seldom left his mother and sister as they moved about the adjacent kitchen. His last contact with home had been a phone call from prison on Oct. 6.“I feel like I am trying to quench my eyes’ thirst to see my family,” he said.He was arrested in August after an informant said he had participated in a July demonstration at the entrance to the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Isawiya when Israeli forces entered. Young men were accused of throwing rocks and burning tires. Bseso denied that he was present. He was convicted and scheduled to be sentenced to a term that could have lasted seven years.Now he’s free and the charges have been withdrawn. He hopes to resume his final year of school and pursue a career in computer science.But normal still feels far away. When he arrived home late Tuesday, Israeli police were stationed outside his house to prevent public celebrations.“My instructions are clear: There are to be no expressions of joy,” Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir told police and prison chiefs last month before the prisoner exchange. “Expressions of joy are equivalent to backing terrorism, victory celebrations give backing to those human scum, for those Nazis.”Bseso’s mother, Mona, said that she prepared a favorite breakfast of hummus and kaak (Jerusalem pretzels) but that Bseso, remembering his former cellmates and their meager rations, teared up and ate little.“I still wake up every morning for the count,” Bseso said, referring to the pre-dawn prisoner roll call.Like others released last month, he described a dark turn in conditions after Oct. 7. Jailers took away the few comforts that prisoners were allowed in their crowded cells, including televisions, radios and personal belongings. Water was sometimes cut entirely. Food was sometimes nothing more than bread, and not much of that, he said.Bseso said he was moved repeatedly to an isolation cell so small the head of the cot was inches from the toilet. For how many days, he doesn’t know. His only glimpse of another human being was the hands that passed food through an opening. His only distraction was a Quran.“I recited the holy Quran three times through,” he said.Israeli and Palestinian civil rights advocates have petitioned the Supreme Court to halt what they say are recent systemic abuses in the prison system. Activists say Israel arrested nearly 3,000 Palestinians in the past eight weeks. Those arrested have included 120 women and more than 200 minors.Advocates allege that the surge has caused overcrowding, the rationing of food and water, and physical and psychological mistreatment, which they say amounts to collective punishment. The court has declined to intervene.“The conditions for young Palestinians have never been great, and we’ve seen a real deterioration since Oct. 7,” said Tal Steiner, head of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. “Holding young people in isolation can have very grave psychological effects.”Israeli prison authorities told The Washington Post that they were unaware of the specific claims of mistreatment made by Bseso and several other recently freed prisoners. They denied systematically denying the rights of incarcerated Palestinians or that conditions have changed since Oct. 7.“All prisoners are detained according to the provisions of the law,” the Israel Prison Service said in an emailed response to detailed questions. “We are not aware of the claims you described. Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined by official authorities.”Malek Debeh, who was freed Tuesday after turning 17 in prison, said he was the oldest of his eight cellmates. He was convicted of rioting against Israeli forces who were conducting a raid in the Shuafat refugee camp in the summer. He denies the charge.He was sentenced to 33 months. Incarceration was tolerable, he said, when he and his cellmates were allowed to pay a prisoner to cook Palestinian food for them. That ended after Oct. 7, when the food became mostly bread and undercooked rice, he said, and almost nothing on Saturdays, the Jewish sabbath. He lost 28 pounds.“I barely recognized him,” said his mother, Nihal Debeh, sitting with him Thursday.She had been waiting 10 hours outside the release center in Jerusalem when he was escorted out in handcuffs and a pair of borrowed slippers.Mother and son were not allowed to touch or talk in the back of the security car that drove them to a West Bank checkpoint. They were transferred to a patrol car that took them to the entrance of Shuafat, where his hands were finally freed.A helicopter hovered over the dark walk to the broken concrete stairs leading to their cramped house. Only there did they embrace. She led him down to family and his favorite meal: Beef in yogurt sauce.",7586,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/04/palestinian-prisoners-released-hostages-exchange/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQ276RAYDKTYLXT2OEGFC37JAE.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQ276RAYDKTYLXT2OEGFC37JAE.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQ276RAYDKTYLXT2OEGFC37JAE.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQ276RAYDKTYLXT2OEGFC37JAE.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQ276RAYDKTYLXT2OEGFC37JAE.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQ276RAYDKTYLXT2OEGFC37JAE.JPG&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,checkpoint birthday isolation washington national hamas terrorism knew water center inch television enter windowless offense conviction deprivation distraction fully physical room cramped deny provision unaware morning rioting past opening examine entirely woman feel change august complaint public email foreign finally withdrawn citizen diplomatic human spent hummus authority detainee held especially refugee borrow tear maneuvering beneath transfer share custody call back make breakfast damon official wake lead drove israel meet tuesday pretzel finger approach touch service informant celebration contact agreement dozen half firework law wonder backing swept quran noticeably surge high prepared molotov cellmates seldom percent comfort force head hold computer thirst entrance deterioration thursday administrative left cut photo detailed patrol advocate described give detain pursue small dramatically clear normal recognize burning week throw amnesty young boy long bseso denies escort camp set rate adjacent life gaze minister prayer school system thinner day holy abuse concrete nihal troop arrive learn fingerprint begin rice present living kaak wait ration equivalent eye time real radio freed sauce skinny handcuff late station dark itamar talk demonstration schedule increase attack condition hand unexpected detention surprise remember mistreatment civil helicopter committee accord father incarcerate count hurriedly expression meal free post shuafat punishment exchange car isawiya convict criticize question hostage allege walk palestinian nation kitchen majority jerusalem career favorite release crime specific accuse heard murder recently halt yogurt group campaign resume health petition sabbath incarceration sister away tire collective streamer refer mona joy prevent charge repeatedly security turn crowd sentence raid hang court reel july chief hover quench home debeh response neighborhood rock pay fight gaza pair family term systematically phone broken year police sat pause whiz hour malek roll major move final amount stair tolerable undercooked recent cell math mother israeli scum gvir international jewish solitary case grave barely cook aware pass bank daytime saturday supreme conduct freedom bead arrest personal noah trial jailer photograph cocktail overcrowd hung detail great kill bread town balloon practice longer story military refuse lose month participate cot hope wound beef nonetheless find systemic prisoner glimpse follow activist age meager victory united decline summer west wall house include told food steiner east toilet prison instruction recite former emerge torture psychological ate claim belonging friday file embrace,-0.992,0.237279198523596,9.691929328621908,0.3568059604794298,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,"U.S. ship shoots down drones in Red Sea, Central Command says",2023-12-04 00:50:00,"Kareem Fahim, Alex Horton, Ben Brasch","A U.S. warship in the Red Sea shot down at least three drones Sunday, according to a U.S. military statement. Initial assessments indicated that at least one of the drones was launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen.The shootdowns occurred as the Carney was responding to distress calls following four attacks against three commercial vessels in the southern Red Sea, U.S. Central Command (Centcom) said.“These attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security. They have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world,” Centcom said in a statement. “We also have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran.”Brig. Gen. Yahya Sarea, the Houthi military spokesman, said in a televised address that the attack was launched in solidarity with Palestinians. He said his Yemen-based force targeted the Unity Explorer and another ship “after they rejected warning messages from the Yemeni naval forces.”“We renew our warning to all Israeli ships or those associated with Israelis that they will become a legitimate target if they violate the statements of our armed forces,” Sarea said. It was not clear what warning they gave in the most recent attacks. The Houthis are a rebel movement that controls much of Yemen’s north.The first incident occurred at roughly 9:15 a.m. local time when the Carney detected an anti-ship ballistic missile launch from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen toward a bulk cargo ship named Unity Explorer, “impacting in the vicinity of the vessel,” Centcom said.Three hours later, the Carney shot down a drone “launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen,” Centcom added. “The drone was headed toward Carney although its specific target is not clear.”In another attack, at 12:35 p.m., the Unity Explorer reported it was struck by a missile fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, suffering minor damage, Centcom said. The Carney again responded to the distress call, and sailors detected another inbound drone and shot it down.About 3:30 p.m., a container ship called Number 9 was struck by a missile fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, Centcom said. The company Bernhard Schulte, which manages the Number 9, confirmed the vessel was “hit by a projectile” while sailing through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. There were no reports of injuries or pollution, according to Kyle Fawkes, a crisis manager working for Bernhard Schulte.An hour later, a third ship, the Sophie II, sent a distress call stating it was hit by a missile. The Carney again responded to the incident and reported no significant damage, but once more shot down a drone “headed in its direction,” Centcom said.Israel has no connection to the vessels involved in the incidents, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari told Reuters.U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have faced near-daily assaults from rocket fire and one-way attack drones since Israeli operations in Gaza began, recording at least 76 attacks since Oct. 17, according to data provided by a U.S. defense official who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of ongoing operations.The United States has responded at times, including airstrikes targeting militants in Iraq after a close-range ballistic missile attack on Nov. 20, the first use of such weapons in this stretch of attacks.",3438,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/04/us-warship-drone-attack-houthi-rebels-yemen/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GG6YR7EXDJWTCNTBZNFT4JKB2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GG6YR7EXDJWTCNTBZNFT4JKB2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GG6YR7EXDJWTCNTBZNFT4JKB2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GG6YR7EXDJWTCNTBZNFT4JKB2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GG6YR7EXDJWTCNTBZNFT4JKB2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GG6YR7EXDJWTCNTBZNFT4JKB2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,confirm central incident jeopardized ship control reject naval suffer shootdowns palestinian bulk local fully state specific number target houthis rebel associate renew arm red anonymity brig container statement assessment drone yahya stretch manages ongoing ballistic airstrikes command distress security crisis strait believe sensitivity call impact hit enable kyle involve official schulte cargo message gaza israel detect daniel hour manager assault sailor represent defense indicate shot commercial multiple recent solidarity projectile israeli area add international missile fire sophie roughly force iraq head report sail country televise vicinity occur warship legitimate data significant give carney sunday clear company direct reason bernhard initial address connection explorer militant houthi rocket violate pollution life fawkes injury centcom commerce military spoke record troop crew struck syria respond begin threat southern direction vessel warn follow time provide bab yemeni united weapon launch world unity work include sarea told maritime attack condition hagari spokesman yemen operation inbound minor accord damage movement post,-0.98925,0.0872600349040139,11.170909090909092,0.2432432432432432,0,2023-12-04
ABC,Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow jumps bail and moves to Canada,2023-12-04 00:47:00,KANIS LEUNG Associated Press,"HONG KONG -- One of Hong Kong’s best-known pro-democracy activists who moved to Canada to pursue her studies said she would not return to the city to meet her bail conditions, becoming the latest politician to flee Hong Kong under Beijing's crackdown on dissidents.Agnes Chow, a famous young face in the city's once-vibrant pro-democracy movement, was arrested in 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law that was enacted following 2019 anti-government protests. She was released on bail but also served more than six months in jail in a separate case over her role in the protests.After Chow was released from prison in 2021, she had to regularly report to the police. She said in an Instagram post on Sunday night that the pressure caused her “mental illnesses” and influenced her decision not to return to the city.Many of her peers have been jailed, arrested, forced into self-exile or silenced after the introduction of the security law in 2020.The suppression of the city's pro-democracy movement highlights that freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997 have been eroded drastically. Both Beijing and Hong Kong governments have hailed the security law for bringing back stability to the semi-autonomous Chinese city.Chow said the authorities in July offered to return her passport so she could pursue studies in Canada under the condition that she traveled to mainland China with them. She agreed, she said, and her trip in August included a visit to an exhibition on China's achievements and the headquarters of tech giant Tencent. The authorities later returned her passport.After considering the situation in Hong Kong, her safety and her health, Chow said she “probably won't return"" to the city again.“I don't want to be forced to do things that I don't want to do anymore and be forced to visit mainland China again. If it continues, my body and my mind will collapse even though I am safe,” she wrote.Chow told TV Tokyo on Monday that she was still weighing her next steps, including the option of seeking asylum in Canada, the broadcaster reported. Asked whether she would take up political activism there, she said she wanted to do something in Hong Kong's interest, TV Tokyo said.Hong Kong police on Monday “strongly condemned” Chow's move, without naming her, saying it was “against and challenging the rule of law.""“Police urge the woman to immediately turn back before it is too late and not to choose a path of no return. Otherwise, she will bear the stigma of ‘fugitive’ for the rest of her life,” the police said in a statement.The police did not respond to questions from The Associated Press on Chow's mainland China trip.Asked about Chow's case at a daily briefing, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Hong Kong is a law-based society and no one has a privilege beyond law. Any illegal acts will be punished, he said.The Hong Kong government also strongly condemned Chow's acts in a statement and said her credibility had gone “bankrupt.""“Unless fugitives surrender themselves, otherwise they would be pursued for life,” it wrote.Chow rose to fame with other prominent young activists Joshua Wong and Nathan Law as a student leader, including in pro-democracy protests in 2014.She co-founded the now-defunct pro-democracy party Demosisto with Wong and Law, but the party was disbanded on June 30, 2020, the same day the security law was enacted.",3439,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/hong-kong-pro-democracy-activist-agnes-chow-jumps-105350081,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/bb34616a-885c-4569-9240-a15020121360/wirestory_3390a413c813917cbda6a735cc766345_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,joshua tencent exhibition national asylum canada question collapse mind student bring body release visit bail city associate silence mainland health woman act august colony return statement nathan june influence fame foreign chow wenbin famous chinese credibility authority seek instagram interest security turn consider july society back british spokesperson bankrupt hong leader challenge activism political meet continue bear police rule china enact pressure offer option move law study situation anymore highlight strongly politician illness case force report rise tv safe trip surrender monday stigma press pursue mental wang role sunday freedom immediately crackdown party travel arrest night briefing prominent promise decision privilege young broadcaster illegal giant urge disband path suppression life kong day safety probably month punish government headquarters respond agree demosisto passport tokyo tech peer follow activist condemn weigh step hail choose late ministry erode drastically include protest flee introduction jail told achievement condition serve beijing prison former stability fugitive rest regularly separate daily movement post,-0.0732499999999999,0.0872346612387321,10.095812499999994,0.3755467571644042,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,The fear of a looming Trump dictatorship,2023-12-04 00:00:00,Ishaan Tharoor,"You’re reading an excerpt from the Today’s WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday.Former congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming is the poster child of a Republican establishment abandoned by the party’s far-right base. Now, she’s billboarding what may come next: In an interview with CBS aired Sunday, Cheney lamented the extent to which the Republican Party had been “co-opted” by Trumpism and said she feared the potential of a vengeful Trump presidency in 2025.“One of the things that we see happening today is a sort of a sleepwalking into dictatorship in the United States,” Cheney said.Cheney’s refusal to accept former president Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him — and her decision to publicly rebuke Trump for his role in stoking the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot — got her ostracized from the GOP and cost her the House seat. She has spent the months since campaigning against his potential reelection, to little avail. Trump is the heavy favorite to emerge as the Republican presidential nominee, no matter the slew of legal cases against him and even the prospect of imprisonment.In her CBS interview, Cheney said a Trump victory could mark the end of the American republic. “He’s told us what he will do,” she said. “It’s very easy to see the steps that he will take.”This isn’t mere hyperbole. As my colleagues have reported over the past year, Trump has made clear his stark, authoritarian vision for a potential second term. He would embark on a wholesale purge of the federal bureaucracy, weaponize the Justice Department to explicitly go after his political opponents (something he claims is being done to him), stack government agencies across the board with political appointees prescreened as ideological Trump loyalists, and dole out pardons to myriad officials and apparatchiks as incentives to do his bidding or stay loyal.In election rallies, Trump has vowed punitive action on all perceived enemies. “I am your retribution,” he told supporters at one event. In another, he promised to “root out the Communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical-left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country, that lie and steal and cheat on elections.”Scholars of 20th-century fascism are less than impressed. “Trump is also using projection: note that he mentions all kinds of authoritarians — communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical left — to set himself up as the deliverer of freedom,” Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian at New York University, told The Washington Post last month. “Mussolini promised freedom to his people too and then declared dictatorship.”Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of American political rhetoric at Texas A&M University, underscored the point over the weekend after Trump cast President Biden at an Iowa rally as “the destroyer of American democracy.” “Trump’s Iowa speech continues his use of fascist rhetoric: it’s us versus them, he tells his supporters, and ‘they’ are enemies who cheat,” Mercieca told my colleagues. “Authoritarians have a lot of rhetorical tricks for explaining away anti-democratic actions as actually ‘democratic.’”Some commentators are looking squarely at Trump and Trumpism as a direct existential threat to the future of U.S. democracy. In a widely circulated opinion essay for The Post, Robert Kagan charted how, “in just a few years, we have gone from being relatively secure in our democracy to being a few short steps, and a matter of months, away from the possibility of dictatorship.”Kagan sees a scenario where Trump’s mounting legal challenges galvanize his push for power, rather than check his rise. “Indicting Trump for trying to overthrow the government will prove akin to indicting Caesar for crossing the Rubicon, and just as effective,” he wrote. “Like Caesar, Trump wields a clout that transcends the laws and institutions of government, based on the unswerving personal loyalty of his army of followers.”Not for nothing have a bevy of Trump-inclined, right-wing intellectuals floated the idea of “Caesarism” — an embrace of a strongman to flush out the perceived weaknesses and failures of the republic — as a necessary political solution for the moment. In Kagan’s view, the institutional checks and balances of the United States are failing to arrest this authoritarian drift.In the event of a return to the White House, Trump and his allies have already said they would marshal more executive power than his predecessors. A Trump election victory could also boost Republican congressional control, and many members of the GOP seem content to march in lockstep with Trump. Then there are the courts, which the former president stacked with a huge number of loyalists.“A conservative litigant can guarantee a sympathetic judge by filing their lawsuit in a federal court in Texas, where a handful of hard-right judges have exclusive control over the docket,” noted the New Republic’s Matt Ford. “From there they go on to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, where conservatives have a clear majority — Trump alone appointed almost half of its members. And then the last stop is the Supreme Court, where half of the conservative supermajority are also Trump appointees.”Among traditional allies of the United States, there’s no shortage of trepidation over what might be around the corner. “Whoever comes to the White House, one case would be a catastrophe, the other case would be much better,” German defense minister Boris Pistorius told reporters last week.But while European policymakers are fretting about Trumpist disturbances to transatlantic ties, the future of the NATO alliance and U.S. support for the war in Ukraine, they are more circumspect about the threat to American democracy itself. Far-right movements are in the ascendant in many countries in Europe, including Germany, but the continent’s parliamentary structures may restrain them more effectively than an anachronistic U.S. system that seems primed to usher in minority rule.“The Trump dictatorship will not be a communist tyranny, where almost everyone feels the oppression and has their lives shaped by it,” wrote Kagan. “In conservative, anti-liberal tyrannies, ordinary people face all kinds of limitations on their freedoms, but it is a problem for them only to the degree that they value those freedoms, and many people do not.”",6477,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/04/trump-dictatorship-authoritarian-election-2024/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,versus destroyer washington base control appointee effective flush exclusive action intellectual content declare handful cost ally number past chart boris circumspect lament feel institutional return mussolini mount note purge live explain spent extent potential marxist false existential heavy loyalty board american bureaucracy squarely worldview push make event capitol presidential apparatchik billboarding official fear power donald sort moment political projection air abandon liz scenario shortage member conservative half essay law tie kind secure clout defense congressional predecessor lockstep tyranny germany underscored vowed inbox trump newsletter rise weekend country supporter left colleague wields role clear cheney european army widely institution point transatlantic publicly confines weakness thug incentive punitive future cbs set life myriad stack minister york system sleepwalk biden government today president wholesale possibility impressed happen ideological anachronistic mark rally problem rhetorical step indict akin news federal overthrow lot alliance idea relatively agency rest fail presidency avail prim free movement post speech reading cross dictatorship refusal march effectively ostracize excerpt commentator slew minority oppression prescreened float explicitly stop executive mercieca congresswoman boost radical majority weaponize favorite lawsuit docket policymakers accept stay state continent corner wyoming easy department enemy campaign authoritarian democracy prove away reporter catastrophe view disturbance filing robert limitation prospect court bevy write root perceive degree german jennifer opponent challenge cast trick hyperbole term continue solution riot caesar gop year unswerving parliamentary circuit rebuke iowa value strongman interview litigant sympathetic loyalist communist appeal fascism reelection nominee case report transcends cheat texas vengeful ukraine dole failure supreme historian sunday freedom party structure arrest stoke establishment direct galvanize steal pardon personal ordinary huge supermajority deliverer support promise decision lie matt opinion matter white rubicon scholar restrain republic usher short europe kagan stark pistorius retribution trumpism month circulate check traditional globe seat threat appoint caesarism sign embark bidding poster vermin trepidation victory united university nato ford house fascist include mention told marshal ruth legal former republican election emerge shape claim justice vision judge guarantee trumpist child rhetoric ascendant embrace fret balance interest,0.9612,0.0926354793886058,9.873825944170768,0.3811503189792663,0,2023-12-04
ABC,China says a US Navy ship 'illegally intruded' into waters in the South China Sea,2023-12-03 23:59:00,The Associated Press,"BEIJING -- The Chinese military said that an American naval ship had “illegally intruded” on Monday into waters near the Second Thomas Shoal, the site of a hot territorial dispute between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea.A Chinese naval force was mobilized to track the USS Gabrielle Giffords during the operation, according to a statement from the People's Liberation Army Southern Theater. The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said the ship ""was conducting routine operations in international waters ... consistent with international law.""Chinese and Philippine naval and coast guard ships have confronted each other repeatedly around the shoal in the Spratly Islands in recent months as China tries to prevent the Philippines from resupplying and repairing a rusting warship that it intentionally ran aground in 1999 to serve as a military outpost.Dwarfed by China’s military might, the Philippines has sought America's help in its multiple territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. agreed to an expansion of the U.S. military presence in the country early this year and launched joint sea and air patrols with the United States late last month.China accuses the U.S. of meddling in waters far from its shores and renewed its charge that America is the one raising regional tensions following the sailing of the USS Giffords near Second Thomas Shoal. The ship is a littoral combat ship designed to operate in coastal areas.“The U.S. deliberately disrupted the situation in the South China Sea, seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security, seriously undermined regional peace and stability, and seriously violated international law and basic norms governing international relations, fully demonstrating that the U.S. is the biggest threat to peace and stability in the South China Sea,” the statement from the Chinese military's Southern Theater said.China has staked claim to virtually all of the reefs and other outcroppings in the South China Sea, building some into islands with runways that could be used by the military. Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also say they are the rightful owners of territory in the same waters in a complex web of overlapping claims.The U.S. has long been the major military power patrolling the South China Sea, an important shipping lane and fishing grounds, operating out of bases in the Pacific. China's emergence as a military power and its ambitions to be a regional and global power are challenging American long-standing dominance.A statement from the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, based in Japan, said its operations in the South China Sea demonstrate a commitment “to upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific region where all nations, large and small, are secure in their sovereignty, can resolve disputes without coercion, and have the freedom to navigate and fly consistent with international laws, rules and norms.”The Philippine coast guard said Sunday that it had sent two ships to Whitsun Reef, another disputed territory in the Spratly Islands, to challenge and document what it estimated to be more than 135 Chinese vessels massing in the area. The Philippines called them a maritime militia and said their presence is illegal. The vessels did not respond to radio challenges, the coast guard said.China, as in similar incidents in the past, said the reef belongs to China and that the nearby waters are an important operating area and shelter for Chinese fishing boats.",3479,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/china-us-navy-ship-illegally-intruded-waters-south-105348983,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9a700504-687b-4c91-82b3-f2bc3ff776cb/wirestory_575c54398a85fe5ebfae42cfa1fcd75c_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,shoal fishing outcropping region incident base ship japan water large naval site navigate building nation design big fully south repair state emergence renew liberation peace past theater consistent ferdinand operate statement virtually rightful global uphold coast ran chinese territorial routine prevent charge giffords repeatedly security operating similar disrupt american call regional littoral sovereignty spratly illegally aground power rust expansion challenge boat air raise marcos year early gabrielle rule china combat territory shipping major law secure island situation intrude recent multiple area sought international overlap nearby fleet force sail hot country warship joint america complex patrol monday taiwan shelter document small conduct govern freedom sunday deliberately navy fly army basic thomas commitment shore guard norm confront long stake illegal violate coastal brunei dispute mass mobilize pacific demonstrate military militia estimate month reef intentionally owner presence web tension president respond whitsun agree threat runway southern resolve vessel follow undermined radio united late launch relation lane important open meddling ground maritime serve beijing vietnam stability operation accuses ambition resupplying malaysia accord claim track coercion belongs philippine free,0.2529,0.1724633515377982,12.143986820428331,0.297543461829176,0,2023-12-03
ABC,French foreign minister says she is open to South Pacific resettlement requests due to rising seas,2023-12-03 23:47:00,ROD MCGUIRK Associated Press,"CANBERRA, Australia -- French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said on Monday she was open to any resettlement request from tiny South Pacific nations threatened by rising sea levels, similar to Australia’s agreement with Tuvalu.Colonna said France had watched with “great interest” last month when Australia offered Tuvalu a lifeline to help residents escape the rising seas and increased storms brought by climate change.At a meeting of Pacific leaders in the Cook Islands, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a plan that will initially allow up to 280 Tuvaluans to come to Australia each year. Tuvalu has a population of 11,000, and its low-lying atolls make it particularly vulnerable to global warming.Colonna said she was not sure if the French Pacific territories of French Polynesia and New Caledonia had the capacity to make similar offers.“I’m open to consider any specific request,” Colonna told the National Press Club.“But ... the size of the Australian continent makes a big difference with the size and beauties of French Polynesia and New Caledonia,” she added.Colonna said the Australian deal initiated by Tuvalu was one way to address some of the challenges posed by climate change.“I’d rather see climate change being controlled and mastered,” Colonna said.“Preemptive action maybe is better than taking some corrective measures when it is late,” she added.She said she did not know the details of the Australia-Tuvalu treaty but was confident it respected basic principles of international law.The treaty commits Australia to assist Tuvalu in response to major natural disasters, health pandemics and military aggression, Albanese said in a statement.It also gives Australia veto power over any security or defense-related agreement Tuvalu wants to make with any other country such as China.Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano said the new arrangement with Australia respected both nations’ sovereignty and committed each country to supporting the other through such challenges as climate change.Colonna spoke to the media ahead of a meeting at Parliament House with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong. The two ministers signed a bilateral agreement on Pacific development cooperation.Defense Minister Richard Marles also met with French Armed Forces Minister Sebastien Lecornu on Monday at New Caledonia where they have gathered for a conference with their South Pacific counterparts.Colonna said Marles and Lecornu were negotiating an agreement on reciprocal access to Australian and French military facilities in the region and increased joint activities.Wong said Australia was keen to work more closely with the French military, particularly in the Pacific.",2705,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/french-foreign-minister-open-south-pacific-resettlement-requests-105348800,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/85d3eb8f-6c7f-4e73-b1f6-7bda3beea882/wirestory_b77617344c2deff169a1e1144d2f7adf_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,measure region national bilateral control request prime medium conference nation action vulnerable big south specific continent population capacity arm initiate health storm global change meeting foreign catherine facility interest natano security similar consider sebastien ahead development make response sovereignty parliament leader power canberra challenge master year resettlement closely colonna offer territory brought agreement major commits access tiny island kausea natural keen beauty gather commit corrective international anthony watch force rise cook richard country joint polynesia monday deal announce confident give press australia difference negotiate principle particularly basic threaten plan address support atoll marles great lifeline caledonia detail minister reciprocal veto french pacific military month disaster spoke penny escape pandemic tuvaluans australian assist initially sign france climate treaty arrangement lecornu late house respect work open told aggression preemptive level increase pose albanese size tuvalu resident,0.9836,0.0,14.74790909090909,0.2566745890275301,0,2023-12-03
CNN,"French police arrest yoga guru in connection with alleged rape, human trafficking and kidnapping scheme",2023-12-03 23:19:00,Sophie Tanno,"French police this week arrested yoga guru Gregorian Bivolaru and 41 others on accusations of kidnap, rape and human trafficking.Alleged victims were drawn in with promises of a spiritual awakening, only to be indoctrinated and mentally manipulated into sexual relations with 71-year-old Bivolaru, a judicial source said.Bivolaru – who was already subject to an Interpol warrant – and the others were arrested during raids in Paris and other areas of France on Tuesday.Twenty-six alleged victims were found living in “deplorable” conditions, the source said.Bivolaru founded a network called the Movement for Spiritual Integration into the Absolute (MISA) in Romania in 1990 before it became known internationally as Atman – the International Federation of Yoga and Meditation, according to French prosecutors and a website for Bivolaru.MISA denied wrongdoing when approached by CNN for comment, and claimed that Bivolaru had not founded Atman nor taught yoga since 1995.A press release, attributed to the board of Atman Federation, and posted on Atman’s website, called the arrests “a slanderous witch-hunt against genuine spirituality.”“Atman Federation is not responsible and not accountable for the private life of students and teachers of the member schools,” the release stated.A press release attributed to the MISA Yoga School and also posted on Atman’s website describes the French school at the heart of the raids as part of the Atman network but an “independent entity, with its own management and organization.”A lawyer from the firm representing Bivolaru declined to comment when approached by CNN on Friday. Citing sources close to the case, AFP reported Bivolaru and others appeared in court on Friday. One source told AFP, Bivolaru said he was “the “victim of a political plot.”A French non-governmental organization (NGO) – Human Rights League – handed over reports from former members of the organization to a government agency that monitors and analyzes cult movements in France in July 2022.The following month, the Paris public prosecutor’s office referred the case to the Central Office for Repression of Violence Against People (OCRVP) – a French government agency responsible for investigating alleged sects to see if any crimes have been committed, the judicial source said.A judicial source said “numerous women of different nationalities claimed to have been victims of the activities of the MISA organization and its leader Gregorian B.”The judicial source added that the school would lure victims in under the guise of tantra yoga, a branch of yoga based on Hindu traditions which centers around the awakening of spirituality via sexuality.Then, the alleged victims said they would be mentally manipulated into accepting “sexual relations designed to suppress any notion of consent regarding sexual relations,” the judicial source said.The judicial source said the alleged victims were told that consent was a reflection of the ego preventing them from reaching a state of spiritual awakening.Victims claimed they were encouraged to “accept sexual relations with the group’s leader, and/or to subscribe to pornographic practices for a fee in France and abroad,” the judicial source said.A judicial investigation was established in July 2023 into allegations of abuse of vulnerable persons by a member of a sect, kidnapping, rape and human trafficking.It culminated in the large-scale operation launched on Tuesday involving a total of 175 French police officers across Paris and several other regions, which saw Bivolaru and others arrested.Twenty-six alleged victims were found living in cramped and unhygienic conditions, the judicial source said.“We led the investigation and carried out the operation with reinforcements from judicial police,” a spokesperson for the OCRVP told CNN. The spokesperson said eight sites were raided.Founded in his home country of Romania in 1990, Bivolaru’s network of schools later expanded internationally to countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia.On MISA’s website, it describes itself as “the largest yoga school in Europe.” It says Bivolaru is equipped with “encyclopaedic knowledge” and “huge practical experience.” MISA refers to Bivolaru as the school’s “spiritual mentor.”“Since 1990, MISA Yoga School has opened yoga courses in more than 250 towns in Romania and 33 other countries,” the website states, adding that the total number of people who have practiced at the school sits at around 35,000.“The yoga instructors are selected through theoretical and practical exams, and undergo a special training,” it adds.The allegations are just the latest in a string of serious charges against Bivolaru.He was convicted of raping a minor in Romania in 2013 and sentenced to six years in prison in absentia. He was extradited from France three years later in 2016.However, he only served a year and three months of his sentence before fleeing Romania in 2017 while on conditional release, and resuming his practices as a yoga guru.He is also on Interpol’s ‘wanted’ list for criminal charges of aggravated trafficking in human beings in Finland, a crime punishable by 10 years in prison.Maya Szaniecki reported from Paris and Sophie Tanno reported from and wrote in London.",5260,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/03/europe/french-police-arrest-yoga-guru-alleged-rape-human-trafficking-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231203065047-gregorian-bivolaru-file-2016.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,july living report private huge pornographic teacher country cnn responsible firm instructor week large criminal organization convict practice political press rape central abroad theoretical violence decline allege sect woman lure regard management prevent spirituality heart region hindu commit number refer london cramped ego website select claimed agency training romania analyzes misa tuesday paris approach base board interpol investigation integration absentia branch represent warrant sophie repression south accusation france area reach knowledge member wrongdoing string activity szaniecki reflection school leader police group hand resume consent part release encyclopaedic network found internationally deny crime league lawyer gregorian notion manipulate deplorable reinforcement guise accept state numerous bivolaru total follow told refers rap raid undergo write finland vulnerable independent traffic carry list launch student describes person conditional spokesperson yoga fee movement spiritual cult extradite source call sexual condition former office genuine different monitor kidnapping minor public punishable judicial slanderous tantra late international ngo officer atman home center comment post north absolute charge site friday victim accountable tradition culminate abuse ocrvp add involve america subscribe town open serve awaken encourage month allegation aggravate prosecutor arrest federation kidnap establish human flee europe guru accord attribute prison case sentence taught year subject afp court nationality practical close indoctrinate promise mentally entity french design special meditation government life lead course relation sits operation equip investigate expand tanno drawn exam suppress unhygienic,-0.9817,0.0,12.823516483516483,0.3381501831501832,0,2023-12-03
CNN,CNN took an 11-day cruise through some of the most-contested waters on Earth. Here’s what we learned,2023-12-03 21:18:00,Brad Lendon,"A nighttime transit through the Taiwan Strait is a test of nerves, seamanship and political awareness in an environment where a slight miscalculation could potentially lead to an international conflict.It’s the first night in November. It’s dark – ink black before the moonrise – and Royal Canadian Navy Cmdr. Sam Patchell is taking that test.His 4,800-ton warship, the frigate HMCS Ottawa, weaves and dodges between dozens of commercial fishing boats and merchant vessels at speeds of up to 24 mph, all the while tasked with staying outside boundaries dictated by international law, including the recognized territorial waters of China.The Ottawa’s radar tracks Chinese warships, which, as they try to keep up with the Canadian frigate, are also weaving in and around the red and green lights of the commercial vessels plying their trade in one of the world’s most crowded waterways.As the captain of a Royal Canadian Navy frigate, Patchell keeps a lawyer and a public affairs officer by his side, because, for Canada – and other Western allies of the United States – this is all about upholding the “rules-based international order,” and if the Canadian ship violates the law of the sea by intruding in territorial waters, or gives adversaries a chance to spin Ottawa’s course as “provocative,” Patchell’s 12-hour cruise would swiftly become an international incident.And he’s not just acting for himself. A mile behind the Ottawa, a US Navy destroyer follows Patchell’s lead. That oncoming fishing boat might miss Ottawa, but if he leaves too little space for it to maneuver then it will be the US destroyer that could run into trouble.It is just one of the tense moments CNN gets to see played out in some of the world’s most contested waters as it joins the Ottawa’s crew for a voyage spanning more than 3,500 miles (5,600 kilometers).There are live-fire exercises, with the guns of three navies trying to blast a speedboat drone to smithereens.There are nail-biting refuelings at sea, during which the 440-foot-long Ottawa slices through the waves less than 200 feet away for supply ships as big as 680-feet long (that’s longer than two football fields).And there are Chinese warships, almost always on the horizon, looking shadowy as they move in and out of the rain showers that so frequently occur across the warm waters of the South China Sea.Other times, the Chinese presence is in the air, and it can be threatening as the crew of the Ottawa’s helicopter discovered when it was twice intercepted by Chinese fighter jets over international waters. The Chinese jets executed maneuvers that “put the safety of all personnel involved at unnecessary risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said.But it isn’t all tension. There are also barbecues, burgers and beers, a Halloween movie night, and an outrageous crossing-the-equator ceremony, complete with a homemade wooden dunking tub and sentences handed down by King Neptune.The Taiwan Strait, the 110-mile wide waterway separating mainland China from the democratically-ruled island of Taiwan, is considered one of the most potentially volatile portions of sea in the world.While conflict rages in Gaza and Ukraine, many analysts fear that these waters could be the next arena for war.Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to take control of Taiwan, which the Chinese Communist Party considers part of its territory – despite never having ruled it – and by force if necessary.But the United States is committed to providing the island the means to defend itself, and Washington has been regularly sending warships through the strait to demonstrate that ships have the right of free passage through it under the international law of the sea.The November 1 transit of USS Rafael Peralta is the sixth this year by US Navy or Coast Guard ships, according to a database kept by Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.Beijing calls these sailings a provocation and a violation of Chinese territory.The Royal Canadian Navy has joined the US Navy on some of sailings, including one last June during which a Chinese warship came dangerously close to the American vessel USS Chung-hoon – so close that the US captain had to take action to avoid a collision.That incident is on the mind of the commander of HMCS Ottawa as his ship enters the strait from the south in the early evening of November 1 with the Rafael Peralta close behind.“We just want to get through here safely,” Patchell, the Ottawa’s captain, says.“The Chung-hoon incident is something I’m thinking about.”Patchell explains his plan for the 12-hour strait crossing. He’ll stick as close as possible to a line that keeps his ship at least 24 nautical miles from the coasts of both mainland China and Taiwan.Although the internationally recognized limit for territorial waters is 12 nautical miles, there’s another 12 outside of that called the “contiguous zone.” It’s a “buffer zone” to allow mainland China or Taiwan, in this case, to warn ships away from their territorial waters, he says, but passing ships have every right to be in it.Still, the Ottawa’s course prompts a warning from Taiwan’s military, which has ships in the strait monitoring the progress of the Ottawa and Rafael Peralta. A voice over the radio advises Patchell to alter course to avoid Taiwan’s zone.But he says his bigger concern are the green-and-red-lit commercial fishing boats that keep popping up in front of the Ottawa. Avoiding a collision with them is Patchell’s most immediate priority.He instructs the crew on minor course changes to weave Ottawa’s way between the lights. And as if he were playing chess, he tries to think several moves ahead.“You have to be careful not to solve one navigation problem and then create three more,” he says.Throughout the night, as the Ottawa weaves, Patchell does all he can to prevent his ship’s bow from pointing in the direction of China. That can send the wrong message, he says.And as day breaks, and the Ottawa heads into the East China Sea at the north end of the strait, Patchell’s navigation plan has worked. Chinese warships have stayed well away – and haven’t even hailed the Ottawa by radio.There is no Chung-hoon repeat on this November night.Though the People’s Liberation Army Navy doesn’t hail HMCS Ottawa this time, they are always watching, visible on radar if unseen by the naked eye in the dark of night.In fact, the PLA Navy seems to have at least one shadow on the Ottawa almost constantly after the fourth day of the cruise, after the Canadian ship approaches the Spratly Islands, a chain in the southern portion of the South China Sea where Beijing has built military installations on manmade islands in contested territories – despite Xi’s pledge not to do so and disregarding the ruling of a United Nations tribunal that some of these territories don’t even belong to China.China claims almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. But portions of it are also claimed by governments in Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.None of those governments make claims as sweeping as Beijing’s.And Beijing has no shortage of ships to assert its claims. Xi has overseen a naval construction boom that has seen China’s navy surpass the US as the world’s largest.The crew of Ottawa is kept keenly aware of the Chinese presence. Each morning at 7 a.m., a wakeup/breakfast call over the ship’s loudspeakers is followed by a report on the ship’s situation.The type and hull number of the Chinese warships tracking Ottawa are part of that situation report.There are other reminders, too. For much of the trip, especially in the vicinity of Chinese-held islands, cell phones are not allowed on the ship’s open decks, in case they become hacking targets. A paper sign on hatches leading to the outside reminds crew members not to take their devices outside.In daylight hours in the South China Sea, from Ottawa’s flight deck or outdoor bridge wings, Chinese warships are often visible to the naked eye. At dusk, their silhouettes sometimes give them away against the setting sun.On October 29, things take a potentially dangerous turn, one that could have cost lives and ratcheted up tensions in the South China Sea to new levels.While searching for a previously noted submarine contact east of the Chinese-claimed Paracel Islands, the Ottawa’s helicopter, with its crew of four, reports two close encounters with Chinese fighter jets, the latter coming within 100 feet of the Canadian helicopter and, on the second occasion, releasing flares in front of it that could have caused it to crash, Canadian officials said.“The risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines, so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,” says Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Ottawa.The incident is far from rare. US defense officials said in October they’d seen almost 200 “coercive and risky” examples of Chinese flying in the previous two years over the South and East China seas.The Canadians see it also. Just two weeks earlier, a Royal Canadian Air Force patrol plane reported an unsafe intercept by a Chinese jet.Beijing has pushed back, accusing Canada of “smearing China” in the chopper episode and lecturing Washington on the location of such close encounters.“(They) were in the waters and airspace around China, not in the Gulf of Mexico or off the US West Coast.” said a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman on October 26. “How can the Chinese military intercept the US aircraft and warships if they don’t come?”The flare incident is on the mind of a CNN reporter flying in the same helicopter over the East China Sea a few days later. There is no Chinese intercept on this day, but CNN spots three Chinese warships during just a three-hour flight. They are just a fraction of an active fleet the Pentagon estimates at more than 340 warships.Two radar operators in the cabin of the copter look for warship contacts on their instruments while in the cockpit two pilots search for the long wakes that are an indication of ships moving at high speeds.“That looks warshippy,” they say when spotting something suspicious.Day four of the 12-day journey sees Ottawa in the southern portion of the South China Sea, in a warship troika with USS Rafael Peralta and the Australian destroyer HMAS Brisbane.The three surface combatants line up with Peralta leading and Ottawa trailing for a chance to test their big guns, five-inch weapons on the bigger Peralta and Brisbane and a 57mm-gun on Ottawa.But Ottawa has the star player of the exercise, the Hammerhead target drone, otherwise known as an unmanned surface vehicle – target (USV-T).It’s essentially a 16-foot remote controlled speedboat capable of speeds up to 40 mph.“The Hammerhead USV-T replicates high-speed naval tactics and a variety of operational guidance plans including straight-on high-speed attacks, crossing patterns, zig zag patterns, and other evasive maneuvers,” the UK-based manufacturer Qinetiq says on its website.Radio operators aboard Ottawa announce over international frequencies that the drill is about to start, and they repeat the warning at 15-minute intervals as it takes place.They identify themselves as “coalition warship 341” – that’s Ottawa’s hull number as seen just behind its bow – and remark how strange it is not to call themselves “Canadian warship 341” as would be standard practice.But it’s a reflection of the cooperation being fostered in the region by Washington and its allies and partners.The live-fire drill is part of exercise “Noble Caribou,” which involves ships and aircraft from five countries – the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand.Units from each of the five move in and out of the exercises depending upon daily priorities. Only Canada, the US and Australia are participating in the live-fire drill.As Peralta, then Brisbane and finally Ottawa test their big guns with smoke bursts out over the open water of the South China Sea, the Hammerhead gets ready to make simulated attack runs at them.Peralta fires first at the speeding boat, shooting off rounds to test the destroyer’s aim but not necessarily sink or disable the Hammerhead. After a few shots, the US ship’s gun misfires.Controllers on the Ottawa start the Hammerhead on a run at Brisbane and the Australian destroyer’s gunners are honed in. An explosive shell disables the remote-controlled speedboat in a puff of black smoke and large splashes of shrapnel.But the Hammerhead isn’t sunk and for safety’s sake – it could be a navigational hazard to other ships if left on the surface – it must be sent to the bottom.That’s Ottawa’s job, but the commanding officer, Cmdr. Patchell, doesn’t want to use shells from the ship’s main gun, which cost more than $7,000 each, to do the job. Ammo from the .50-caliber machine gun on the ship’s bridge wing should be able to sink the Hammerhead much more cheaply.After a few bursts, flames pour from the 16-foot drone, quickly consuming it as leaking fuel burns on top of the water. Hammerhead’s bow rises up and it slips beneath the surface, leaving fuel and oil burning for a minute or two.Lt. Sean Milley, operations officer on the Ottawa, says the live-fire drill was a success.The Americans don’t have drones like the Hammerhead, he says, so US gunners love the chance to be tested by the Canadian drone in exercises like these.Ottawa has a range of almost 11,000 miles (17,600 kilometers). That is more than enough to cover the distance it will travel during the voyage from Singapore to Okinawa on this trip.But the ship must constantly be ready for all eventualities, says Lt. Cmdr. Christine Hurov, the Ottawa’s public affairs officer.So, it keeps fuel tanks for its two gas-turbine and single diesel engines topped up through replenishments at sea, known as RAS to the crew.Ottawa takes on average about 40,000 gallons (150,000 liters) of fuel in an RAS event. That’s about a quarter of the capacity of its fuel tanks. It does four refuelings during the trip from Singapore to Okinawa, one from a New Zealand supply vessel, two from an American one, and onee from an Australian one.The refuelings are tests of nerves, seamanship, communications and coordination for the crews of both the supply ships and the frigate.During the first RAS, with the New Zealand Navy’s largest ship ever, HMNZS Aotearoa, Cmdr. Patchell cautiously moves his ship alongside HMNZS Aotearoa, which at 24,000 tons is about five times Ottawa’s size.The Ottawa’s crew crouches for cover behind anything solid as the supply ship fires lines across that will carry fuel hoses and distance markers.Once the fuel hose is locked into the receptacle for Ottawa’s tanks, Patchell and his crew try to maintain a constant 16 mph speed with the supply ship and hold the distance at between 160 feet to 200 feet.Patchell and his ship drivers are also fighting physics. The rushing, turbulent seas between the two ships are real-life applications of what is known as Bernouli’s principle – pressure changes due to the speed of the waters could pull Ottawa into the much larger tanker.Patchell issues course corrections of one or two degrees to keep Ottawa lined up and the fuel hoses connected.The refueling takes about 90 minutes, and when the fuel lines have been drained and the connection is broken, it’s celebrated, as all RAS are aboard Ottawa, with blaring music, on this occasion from Canadian artist the Weeknd, with “Blinding Lights.”A later RAS, on a Saturday with the American ship USNS Wally Schirra, is appropriately ended with Loverboy’s “Working for the Weekend.”But the crew of Australia’s HMAS Stalwart probably get the award for music during the Ottawa’s 11-day cruise.Midway through a nighttime refueling in the East China Sea, the Australian vessel began blaring “Oh Canada” (not the Canadian national anthem) from rapper Classified across the waves as the opener of a set of tunes. Coupled with the glow sticks that help illuminate the work areas on Ottawa, it makes the ocean seem more like a dance party than a military maneuver.Like the Australians, the Canadians try to make sure there’s a balance to what they do in these contested waters.So there is a beer, burger and hotdog barbecue on the rear flight deck. For Halloween there are decorations, costumes and a movie night featuring a scary flick on a big screen watched from personal lawn chairs under an almost full moon (and the watchful eyes of a Chinese warship).But the highlight of this voyage for many aboard the Canadian frigate is a “crossing the line” ceremony, an event that marks the first time a sailor crosses the equator.Dozens aboard Ottawa earned their spot in the ceremony when the frigate dipped into the Southern Hemisphere to the south of Malaysia and Singapore earlier in its Pacific deployment.The ritual involves soakings, eating unappetizing food, a court presided over by King Neptune, god of the sea, and eventually a dunking in a specially constructed “hot tub” on the rear flight deck of Ottawa.At the end, first-time crossers are issued cards to prove their status that they will treasure for the rest of their sea-going days, lest they be sentenced by Neptune’s court again.One enlisted crewman describes getting the card as Christmas come early with the best present ever.It’s the kind of thing Patchell wants to hear from his crew.He doesn’t want his crew wound too tight, and he also wants to show that what Ottawa is doing is routine, moving through international waters in ways allowed by international laws and norms.“We don’t have what’s called freedom of navigation operations,” he says.He goes over Ottawa’s planned route.“It’s international waters, and we want to go in that direction. We’ll go in that direction, as we’re allowed to do,” he says.“We don’t make it a thing.”",17915,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/03/asia/canada-south-china-sea-taiwan-strait-mil-dst-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231117024320-01-canadian-navy-cnn-cruise.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",International

NPR,"Houthi missiles strike commercial ships in Red Sea, while U.S. warship downs drones",2023-12-03 20:54:00,The Associated Press,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Three commercial ships in the Red Sea were struck by ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled Yemen on Sunday and a U.S. warship shot down three drones in self-defense during the hourslong assault, the U.S. military said. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran. The attacks marked an escalation in a series of maritime attacks in the Mideast linked to the Israel-Hamas war, as multiple vessels found themselves in the crosshairs of a single Houthi assault for the first time in the conflict. In a statement, U.S. Central Command said the attacks ""represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security. They have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world."" It said the three commercial ships and their crews are connected to 14 countries. According to Central Command, the USS Carney, a Navy destroyer, detected a ballistic missile fired from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at the Bahamas-flagged bulk carrier Unity Explorer. The missile hit near the ship. Shortly afterward, the Carney shot down a drone headed its way, although it's not clear if the destroyer was the target. The drone was also launched from Yemen. About 30 minutes later, the Unity Explorer was hit by a missile, and while responding to the distress call the Carney shot down another incoming drone. Central Command said the Unity Explorer reported minor damage from the missile. Two other commercial ships, the Panamanian-flagged bulk carriers Number 9 and Sophie II, were both struck by missiles. The Number 9 reported some damage but no casualties, and the Sophie II reported no significant damage. While sailing to assist the Sophie II, the Carney shot down another drone heading in its direction. The drones did no damage. ""We also have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran,"" Central Command said, adding that the U.S. will consider ""all appropriate responses."" The Carney, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, has already shot down multiple rockets the Houthis have fired toward Israel so far in the war. It hasn't been damaged in any of the incidents and no injuries have been reported on board. Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed Sunday's attacks, saying the first vessel was hit by a missile and the second by a drone while in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. Saree did not mention any U.S. warship being involved in the attack. ""The Yemeni armed forces continue to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea (and Gulf of Aden) until the Israeli aggression against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip stops,"" Saree said. ""The Yemeni armed forces renew their warning to all Israeli ships or those associated with Israelis that they will become a legitimate target if they violate what is stated in this statement."" Saree also identified the first vessel as the Unity Explorer, which is owned by a British firm that includes Dan David Ungar, who lives in Israel, as one of its officers. The Number 9 is linked to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. Managers for the two vessels could not be immediately reached for comment. Israeli media identified Ungar as being the son of Israeli shipping billionaire Abraham ""Rami"" Ungar. The Houthis have launched a series of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, as well as launching drones and missiles targeting Israel. The U.S. has stopped short of saying its Navy ships were targeted, but has said Houthi drones have headed toward the ships and have been shot down in self defense. Global shipping had increasingly been targeted as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to become a wider regional conflict — even as a truce briefly halted fighting and Hamas exchanged hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. However, the collapse of the truce and the resumption of punishing Israeli airstrikes on Gaza and a ground offensive there had raised the risk of the seaborne attacks resuming. In November, the Houthis seized a vehicle transport ship also linked to Israel in the Red Sea off Yemen. The rebels still hold the vessel near the port city of Hodeida. Missiles also landed near another U.S. warship last week after it assisted a vessel linked to Israel that had briefly been seized by gunmen. However, the Houthis had not directly targeted the Americans for some time, further raising the stakes in the growing maritime conflict. In 2016, the U.S. launched Tomahawk cruise missiles that destroyed three coastal radar sites in Houthi-controlled territory to retaliate for missiles being fired at U.S. Navy ships at the time.",4758,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/03/1216851042/pentagon-says-a-warship-and-commercial-ships-have-come-under-attack-in-the-red-s,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/10/26/gettyimages-1733234512_sq-8f4a83fe92c1a11ab5fa3e40449e0aeb8c6c55e0-s100-c15.jpg,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,crosshairs central destroyer hamas ship collapse medium navigate billionaire port fully number casualty target houthis appropriate renew arm global claimed wider statement drone comment command held marked strait consider responsibility board american grow call back hit enable regional schulte single israel saree detect seaborne shipping strip defense commercial shot officer fire cruise arab force head sail hold country ramus warship legitimate escalation connect clear threatens reason bernhard series explorer land week hourslong rocket stake violate coastal life injury transport commerce punish crew struck vessel warn time brother ungar bab world gulf aggression briefly attack spokesman seize found accord increasingly tomahawk exchange incident jeopardized hostage directly site stop hodeida palestinian bulk state city vehicle rebel halt associate shortly red brig resume resumption yahya ballistic mideast airstrikes prevent security distress carrier believe british response involve dubai fight gaza offensive continue raise minute territory manager assault reach gunman represent identify conflict incoming multiple israeli area add international missile sophie report significant carney sunday arleigh immediately navy direct destroyed truce emirate link houthi abraham david risk shipmanagement afterward short military aden firm respond assist threat retaliate direction prisoner november yemeni united launch unity mention include radar maritime ground yemen minor damage steadfast iran,-0.99675,0.0,9.908045977011495,0.2474393530997305,0,2023-12-03
CNN,"One dead, two injured in Paris knife and hammer attack near Eiffel Tower",2023-12-03 19:22:00,Heather Chen,"French police have arrested a man suspected of killing one person and injuring two others in a knife and hammer attack in central Paris.The attack took place at Bir Hakeim, near the Eiffel Tower, France’s Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters at the scene on Saturday night.He said that the man arrested was a French citizen previously known to intelligence services.One man – a German tourist born in the Philippines – was killed in the attack and two others sustained non-life threatening injuries, he added.One of those wounded was a British national, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said Sunday. The other was French, a spokeswoman for the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office said.One of the police officers responding to the scene used a taser to neutralize the attacker, Darmanin said. The suspect’s life is not at risk, he added.“After his arrest, he said he could no longer bear to see Muslims dying in both Afghanistan and Palestine,” Darmanin said.Addressing reporters, Darmanin said that the suspect was born in France in 1997 and had been sentenced to four years in prison back in 2016 for planning “violent action.”The suspect was known to intelligence services for having “serious psychiatric disorders,” Darmanin added.The minister said he had been told by police that the attacker had reportedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” during the assault.According to a televised briefing by French anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-François Ricard, the suspect had pledged allegiance to the group in a video posted on X, and had been required to receive treatment for psychiatric disorders following his release from prison in 2020, Ricard said.Three people close to the suspect were also taken into custody on Sunday, the prosecutor’s office said.French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne held a cabinet meeting on Sunday to review the country’s current security arrangements.French President Emmanuel Macron called the incident a terror attack and said France’s anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office would investigate.“I send all my condolences to the family and loved ones of the German national who died this evening,” Macron wrote in a post on X in the early hours of Sunday.He also thanked the French emergency services.“The national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office now will be responsible for shedding light on this matter so that justice can be done in the name of the French people,” Macron wrote.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was “shocked” by the incident.“Our thoughts are with the injured, families and friends of the victims. Once again, it is clear why we are resolutely standing up to hatred and terror,” Scholz wrote on X.Videos taken at the scene showed police cars, ambulances and the Paris Fire Brigade arriving, with heavy traffic being diverted away.

Reuters,Pentagon aware of attacks claimed by Houthis on ships in Red Sea,2023-12-03 18:24:00,Aziz El Yaakoubi,"RIYADH, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The Pentagon said it was aware of reports regarding attacks on an American warship and commercial vessels in the Red Sea on Sunday, as Yemen's Houthi group claimed drone and missile attacks on two Israeli vessels in the area.""We're aware of reports regarding attacks on the USS Carney and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and will provide information as it becomes available,"" the Pentagon said.Yemen's Houthi movement said its navy had attacked two Israeli ships, Unity Explorer and Number 9, with an armed drone and a naval missile.A spokesperson for the group's military said the two ships were targeted after they rejected warnings, without elaborating.In a broadcast statement the spokesperson said the attacks were in response to the demands of the Yemeni people and calls from Islamic nations to stand with the Palestinian people.An Israeli military spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The reported incident follows a series of attacks in Middle Eastern waters since war broke out between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Oct. 7.An Israeli-linked cargo ship was seized last month by the Houthis, allies of Iran. The group, which controls most of Yemen's Red Sea coast, had previously fired ballistic missiles and armed drones at Israel and vowed to target more Israeli vessels.The Bahamas-flagged bulk carrier Unity Explorer is owned by Unity Explorer Ltd and managed by London-based Dao Shipping Ltd, LSEG data showed. The ship was scheduled to arrive in Singapore on Dec. 15.Number 9, which was headed to Suez port, is a Panama-flagged container ship owned by Number 9 Shipping Ltd and managed by Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK-based Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the data showed.Both owners and managers of the two vessels could not be immediately reached for comment.ABC News, citing a U.S. official, said the USS Carney had been involved in multiple engagements involving Houthi attacks on commercial vessels.""In at least two circumstances, the Carney successfully shot down (drones) headed in its direction,"" the official told ABC.British maritime security company Ambrey and sources said earlier that a bulk carrier and a container ship had been hit by at least two drones while sailing in the Red Sea.Ambrey said the container ship had reportedly suffered damage from a drone attack about 63 miles northwest of the northern Yemeni port of Hodeidah.",2434,https://www.reuters.com/world/britains-maritime-agency-reports-potential-explosion-red-sea-2023-12-03/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BFQFYJTGUJOUJHFHSRRMIFPGXE.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bulk owner unity drone bernhard reportedly number water dao yemen nation ambrey manage israel demand earlier militant reuters iran source missile circumstance vessel dec stand aware container houthi sail sunday hamas red call reach warship engagement warning manager mile news request broadcast told israeli reject eastern houthis claimed yemeni cargo islamic month military involve navy respond successfully shipmanagement suez shot northern spokesperson direction coast seize arrive incident immediately schedule follow head statement information control fire available official ally northwest attack middle american previously carney riyadh regard area broke damage ballistic provide explorer pentagon data hit response singapore group suffer show movement maritime vowed multiple hodeidah series security arm palestinian port commercial naval schulte lseg report target company shipping carrier ship,-0.948,0.0,12.40217494089834,0.2030092592592592,0,2023-12-03
Politico,US threatens ‘appropriate responses’ after Iran-backed assault on commercial ships,2023-12-03 18:02:00,Lara Seligman,"The U.S. warned it was considering “all appropriate responses” after Houthi rebels attacked three commercial vessels in the Red Sea on Sunday, ramping up its rhetoric as Iran-backed militants continue to harass American and international interests in the region.Following the attacks, a U.S. warship operating nearby responded to the distress calls from the commercial ships, shooting down three aerial drones over the course of the day, U.S. Central Command said in a release.While Defense Department officials said they did not believe the militants were targeting the U.S. warship — the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Carney — the string of attacks on the commercial vessels “represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security,” Central Command said.While the attacks were carried out by Houthis, the U.S. has “every reason to believe” they were “fully enabled by Iran,” according to the release. “The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international allies and partners.”The language is an explicit threat to Iran that the U.S. may retaliate to the attacks, which are just the latest in the region in recent weeks. Iran-backed militants have also attacked U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria at least 74 times since Oct. 17.Separately on Sunday, the U.S. military conducted a strike in northern Iraq, killing multiple Iran-backed fighters, according to a U.S. official, who was granted anonymity to speak ahead of an announcement. The fighters were observed preparing to launch a drone or rocket attack, likely against U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria; the U.S. hit the targets before they could launch any weapons.Sunday saw a total of four attacks against three separate commercial vessels linked to 14 separate nations, Central Command said. The Carney, which was conducting a patrol in the Red Sea, responded to the ships’ distress calls, shooting down three drones in total.At 9:15 a.m. local time, the Carney detected an anti-ship ballistic missile fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen targeting the M/V Unity Explorer, a Bahamian-flagged, UK-owned and operated bulk cargo ship. The missile came down “in the vicinity of the vessel.”Then at 12 p.m., the Carney shot down a drone launched from Yemen. While the drone was headed toward the ship, Central Command said it “cannot assess at this time” that the Carney was the target. There was no damage to the vessel or injuries to its crew.At 12:35 p.m., the Carney responded to a distress call from the Unity Explorer, which reported it was struck by a missile fired by the Houthis. While assisting with the damage assessment to the commercial ship, the Carney detected a second drone, and took it down.At 3:30 p.m., the M/V Number 9, a Panamanian-flagged, Bermuda and UK-owned and operated bulk carrier, was then struck by a missile fired by the Houthis while operating in the Red Sea.An hour later, at 4:30 p.m., the M/V Sophie II, a Panamanian-flagged bulk carrier, crewed by sailors from eight countries, sent a distress call saying it was struck by a missile. While en route to respond, the Carney shot down another aerial drone headed in its direction.Commercial shipping has increasingly come under assault in the Red Sea since the Israel-Hamas conflict kicked off on Oct. 7.The Carney has shot down multiple Houthi-launched cruise missiles and drones targeting commercial vessels in recent weeks. Although DOD officials do not assess the U.S. ship was the target of any of the attacks, the commander deemed some of them a threat and acted in self-defense.",3594,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/03/u-s-threatens-appropriate-responses-after-iran-backed-assault-on-commercial-ships-00129819,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/fd57ccd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x1071+0+0/resize/630x450!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd7%2F97%2F7a389baf4340bf6415eb9d60a1ef%2Fyemen-76176.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,increasingly central destroyer region ship northern nation bulk local course fully release state ally number target houthis appropriate rebel full red department anonymity commander act operate assessment drone fighter ballistic carry command distress security harass consider operating believe carrier american ahead call hit language response enable ramp official cargo continue detect hour strike shipping assault sailor represent defense commercial shot conflict shoot recent multiple grant area international missile fire nearby announcement sophie total cruise iraq head report country vicinity warship patrol carney conduct sunday arleigh coordination direct reason observe explorer week link militant houthi rocket injury kill day commerce military troop aerial speak string dod syria struck respond assist route threat retaliate kick crewed vessel warn explicit time united deem late launch unity maritime prepare attack yemen bermuda accord separate rhetoric ass damage iran interest,-0.99225,0.0834724540901502,11.199007751937984,0.2083333333333333,0,2023-12-03
Politico,Israel expands Gaza ground offensive,2023-12-03 15:42:00,Associated Press,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — The Israeli military said Sunday that its ground offensive had expanded to every part of Gaza, and authorities ordered more evacuations in the crowded south as they vowed that operations there against Hamas would be “no less strength” than the earlier efforts in the north.Heavy bombardment followed the evacuation orders, and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip said they were running out of places to go in the sealed-off territory that borders Israel and Egypt. Many of its 2.3 million people are crammed into the south after Israel ordered civilians to leave the north in the early days of the war, which was sparked by the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.The United Nations estimates that 1.8 million Gazans have been displaced. Juliette Toma, director of communications at the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said nearly 958,000 of them were in 99 U.N. facilities in the south.After dark, gunfire and shelling could be heard in the central town of Deir al-Balah as flares lit the sky. In Gaza’s second-largest city of Khan Younis, Israeli drones buzzed overhead. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk urged an end to the war, saying civilian suffering was “too much to bear.”The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said the death toll there since Oct. 7 has surpassed 15,500, with more than 41,000 wounded. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but said 70% of the dead were women and children.A Health Ministry spokesman asserted that hundreds had been killed or wounded since a weeklong cease-fire ended Friday. “The majority of victims are still under the rubble,” Ashraf al-Qidra said.Fears of a wider conflict intensified. A U.S. warship and multiple commercial ships came under attack in the Red Sea, the Pentagon said. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed attacks on two ships they described as being linked to Israel but did not acknowledge targeting a U.S. Navy vessel.Hopes for another temporary truce in Gaza were fading. The cease-fire facilitated the release of dozens of the roughly 240 Gaza-held Israeli and foreign hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. But Israel has called its negotiators home, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war will continue until “all its goals” are achieved. One is to remove Hamas from power in Gaza.Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said resuming talks with Israel on further exchanges must be tied to a permanent cease-fire.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told NBC’s “Meet the Press” the U.S. was working “really hard” for a resumption of negotiations.Israel’s military widened evacuation orders in and around Khan Younis in the south, telling residents of at least five more areas to leave. Residents said the military dropped leaflets saying “Khan Younis city is a dangerous combat zone” and ordering them to move south to the border city of Rafah or a coastal area in the southwest.But Halima Abdel-Rahman, a widow and mother of four, said she won’t heed such orders anymore. She fled her home in October to an area outside Khan Younis, where she stays with relatives.“The occupation tells you to go to this area, then they bomb it,” she said by phone. “The reality is that no place is safe in Gaza. They kill people in the north. They kill people in the south.”The United States, Israel’s closest ally, has urged Israel to avoid significant new mass displacement and do more to protect civilians. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris told Egypt’s president that “under no circumstances” would the U.S. permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, an ongoing siege of Gaza or the redrawing of its borders.On the ground in Gaza, there was frustration and mourning. Outside a Gaza City hospital, a dust-covered boy named Saaed Khalid Shehta dropped to his knees beside the bloodied body of his little brother Mohammad, one of several bodies laid out after people said their street was hit by airstrikes. He kissed him.“You bury me with him!” the boy cried. A health worker at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital said more than 15 children were killed.Israel’s military said its fighter jets and helicopters struck targets in the Gaza Strip including “tunnel shafts, command centers and weapons storage facilities.” It acknowledged ”extensive aerial attacks in the Khan Younis area.”The bodies of 31 people killed in bombardment of central Gaza were taken to the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, said Omar al-Darawi, a hospital administrative employee. One woman wept, cradling a child’s body. Another carried the body of a baby. Later, hospital workers reported 11 more dead after another airstrike. Bloodied survivors included a child carried in on a mattress.Outside a morgue in Khan Younis, resident Samy al-Najeila carried the body of a child. He said his sons had been preparing to evacuate their home, “but the occupation didn’t give us any time. The three-floor building was destroyed completely, the whole block was totally destroyed.” He said six of the bodies were his relatives.“Five people are still under the rubble,” he said. “God help us.”During a trip to the United Arab Emirates as the top U.S. representative at the U.N. climate conference, Harris said: “Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.”Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel was making “maximum effort” to protect civilians. In addition to the leaflets, the military has used phone calls and radio and TV broadcasts to urge Gazans to move from specific areas.Israel says it targets Hamas operatives and blames civilian casualties on the militants, accusing them of operating in residential neighborhoods. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Israel says at least 78 of its soldiers have been killed in the offensive in northern Gaza.The widening offensive likely will further complicate humanitarian aid to Gaza. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said 100 aid trucks entered Sunday, but U.N. agencies have said 500 trucks per day on average entered before the war.The renewed hostilities also have heightened concerns for the 137 hostages who the Israeli military believes are still being held by Hamas. During the recent truce, 105 hostages were freed, and Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners. Most of those released by both sides were women and children.The families of hostages have called for an urgent meeting with Israel’s Security Cabinet, saying time is “running out to save those still held by Hamas.”Elsewhere in the region, Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group said it struck Israeli positions near the tense Lebanon-Israel border. Eleven people — eight soldiers and three civilians — were wounded by Hezbollah fire in the area of Beit Hillel, army radio reported. The military said its artillery struck sources of fire from Lebanon. It also said its fighter jets struck other Hezbollah targets.And Iraqi militants with the Iran-backed umbrella group the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said they struck the Kharab al-Jir U.S. military base in Syria with rockets. A U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said rockets hit Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria but there were no reports of casualties or damage.",7381,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/03/israel-expands-gaza-ground-offensive-00129810,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/4694779/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x5760+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F6d%2F09%2F9899c42049378184e916d359131c%2Fisrael-palestinians-75956.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,central national base hamas broadcast morgue ship center prime concern john iraqi suffer mourn frustration enter flare knee council body south leaflet ally casualty target adviser renew assert hezbollah woman benjamin claimed meeting toma goal cradle drone wider samy director foreign halima ongoing kirby türk carry volker nbc authority permit human command held refugee top operative widen thousand storage call october hit make extensive islamic heighten displacement official power israel meet early combat resistance aid kharab dozen lit save victim strip bury tie avoid blame shaft commercial anymore saaed leave baby vowed buzz fire arab iraq force earlier vice urgent administrative warship kiss hillel senior tv osama hamdan described side give communication bombardment completely army rafah innocent land rumalyn netanyahu boy militant rocket surpass totally urge coastal gunfire egypt minister displace mass run million day siege ashraf street drop bloody struck president laid mark god strength time provide brother radio freed hospital zone khalid dark ministry tense talk regev work overhead baptist civilian attack condition jet imprison spokesman agency part differentiate helicopter expand crossing khan residential bomb deir resident wept death spark exchange region combatant shehta closest fading northern hostage gazans cabinet conference building palestinian nation circumstance wael majority average evacuation tunnel acknowledge release stay state specific city accuse heard rebel artillery red hard protect anonymity group health resume line resumption fighter place airstrikes lebanon facility crowd security evidence younis operating believe chief hundred home neighborhood negotiator harris gaza offensive family continue phone redrawing soldier regulation territory juliette rubble move temporary conflict complicate multiple humanitarian recent mother israeli north area omar block abu roughly maximum airstrike report safe trip bank significant cry press worker umbrella sunday relocation navy occupation sky weeklong destroyed truce emirate link eleven houthi beit survivor permanent kill border facilitate town shell source widow military position heed estimate evacuate reality aerial speak wound syria intensified toll climate prisoner representative follow dangerous united weapon west hostility effort house include truck flee told prepare ground employee remove order kamala crammed addition operation yemen dead claim friday child achieve mohammad damage pentagon,-0.9967,0.4877387887820077,10.401364985163202,0.3267072129748186,0,2023-12-03
USA TODAY,US warship shoots down drones over Red Sea; Israel expands ground offensive in Gaza,2023-12-03 15:41:16,"John Bacon, Jorge L. Ortiz","An American warship responded to attacks on three commercial ships Sunday in international waters of the Red Sea, a possible escalation of the war just as Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip intensifies following a weeklong truce. The USS Carney shot down three drones while responding to distress calls from the vessels after they were targeted by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the Pentagon said in a statement. The assaults with ballistic missiles lasted about seven hours and damaged two of the ships, according to the statement. The Defense Department initially described the assault as an attack on the Carney before providing more details, but later said it was unclear if the warship was targeted. ""These attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security,'' the U.S. Central Command said. ""They have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world. ... The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international allies and partners.'' The Carney, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, is described on its website as ""505 feet of American fighting steel."" It was not damaged and no serious injuries were reported, a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Associated Press. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have ambushed multiple ships in the Red Sea in recent days, claimed responsibility for attacking two commercial ships saying they were from Israel, but made no mention of the Carney. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the ships don't have a connection to the country. The attacks, combined with an increase in clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah near the Lebanon border, could represent steps toward an expansion of the war in the region, something the Biden administration has labored to prevent. The war began Oct. 7, when militants from Gaza swept across the Israeli border in a murderous assault that left about 1,200 people dead, many of them women and children. Israel says close to 100 of its soldiers have died in the ensuing attack on the Palestinian enclave. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says more than 15,500 Palestinians have been killed, 70% of them women and children, and upward of 41,000 have been injured. VP Harris calls on Israel to respect international law, stop killing innocent Palestinians Developments: ∎ Five members of an Iran-backed militia were killed in an airstrike blamed on the U.S. near Kirkuk in northern Iraq, Reuters reported, citing Iraqi security sources who said the group was preparing to attack U.S. forces with projectiles. ∎ U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the administration is working ""hour by hour"" to get Israel and Hamas back to the negotiating table but doesn't know when it might happen. Israel has sent its negotiators home. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said a permanent cease-fire must be on the table for the group to resume talks. ∎ Hamas said more than 700 Palestinians were killed in the first 24 hours after the truce ended and fighting resumed. ""There is NO SAFE PLACE in Gaza as the Israeli occupation forces commit atrocities everywhere in the Strip,"" the group's leaders said in a statement. ∎ The Ziv Medical Center in the Israeli city of Safed near the Lebanese border said it had admitted 12 people wounded from a Hezbollah missile attack. Lebanon-based Hezbollah has so far declined to become fully engaged in the war. ∎ The bodies of 31 Palestinians killed in Israeli bombardment across central Gaza were taken to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, said Omar al-Darawi, a hospital administrative employee. ∎ The United Nations estimates that 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced. ∎ The intensifying combat will likely interfere with humanitarian aid to Gaza. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, told the Associated Press that 100 aid trucks entered Sunday. But U.N. agencies have said 500 trucks per day on average entered before the war. The Israeli military said Sunday that operations in southern Gaza would be “no less strength” than its previous offensive in the north. More evacuations were ordered as the Israeli military's ground offensive expanded to every part of Gaza on Sunday. Heavy bombardment followed the evacuation orders. Palestinians, who had fled from north Gaza seeking an escape from the Israeli bombardment, said they were running out of places to go in the sealed-off territory bordering Israel and Egypt. The U.N. says nearly 960,000 Palestinians are sheltering at its 99 facilities in the south. The Gaza Strip’s second-largest city, Khan Younis, has become the focus of the Israeli military campaign as it continues in the southern part of the enclave. Israel has been dropping leaflets telling civilians Khan Younis is a ""dangerous combat zone"" and directing them to go to Rafah farther south or to a coastal area in the southwest. The message has also been relayed through phone calls and TV and radio broadcasts, for those who have access to them. But UNICEF spokesman James Elder said the warnings are useless for people who may not have the means to move and will force them instead to seek refuge in a shelter with no toilets or running water. “It’s not scientific, it’s not rational, it’s not possible,’’ he told CNN from Khan Younis. “The only things I think it is are calculated and cruel.’’ Elder pointed out the “bombardments are absolutely relentless,’’ making getting away from them difficult, and said doctors had told him the so-called safe zones would soon be riddled with disease, likely leading to more deaths. UNICEF aims to provide humanitarian aid and education to children. In one post on X Sunday, Elder raised the alarm about “the endless killing of children here,’’ and in another he said, “I am seeing massive child casualties. We have a final warning to save children; and our collective conscience.’’ Israel's Gaza bombardment targets crowded south; map marks evacuation orders Unarmed British aircraft will carry out surveillance flights over Gaza to support efforts to locate and free hostages held by militants, British Defense Minister Grant Shapps said Sunday. He said Britons remain in Hamas custody and that ""their freedom is our utmost priority."" Hamas condemned the announcement, saying Britain had become a partner in the Israeli occupation. ""The UK should have corrected its historically negative stance towards our people,"" the statement said. ""It should remind the world of its shameful colonial past."" Militants seized about 240 hostages and brought them to Gaza on Oct. 7. Israel says 110 have since been freed – 86 Israelis and 24 foreigners – in exchange for about 240 Palestinian prisoners. Israel’s military, which for weeks directed more than 1 million Gazans to evacuate the northern region of the enclave, ordered more areas in southern Gaza evacuated Sunday as residents scrambled to find somewhere to go. Israel has shifted much of its bombardment to the south, near Gaza's second-largest city of Khan Younis. Israeli officials say they believe many members of the Hamas military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, have fled northern Gaza with the evacuees and are hiding in and around the city. ""We fought hard and thoroughly in the north of the Gaza Strip, and we will do it now in the south,"" Israel military Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said. Khan Younis was home to more than 200,000 people before the war. Now it is far more crowded after residents of the north sought refuge in the area. ""Brutal resumption of hostilities in Gaza and the terrifying impact on civilians underscore the need to end the violence,"" said U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk, adding that civilian suffering was “too much to bear.” The Israeli military said Sunday it had located over 800 shafts of Hamas underground tunnels and many miles of tunnel routes in the Gaza Strip since the war began almost two months ago. Some of the shafts connected ""strategic"" underground Hamas assets, and weapons were found in many of them, Israel said. About 500 of the tunnels and miles of tunnel routes were destroyed with explosives or blockades. ""The shafts were located in civilian spaces, and many of them were located near or inside buildings such as educational institutions, kindergartens, mosques and playgrounds,"" the Israeli military said. Israel has stepped up its military offensive across Gaza since a truce that allowed for the exchange of militant-held hostages and Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners ended over the weekend.

Reuters,Lula in Berlin for first Brazil-Germany talks in eight years,2023-12-03 15:37:00,"Andreas Rinke, Sarah Marsh","BERLIN, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva landed in Berlin on Sunday for the first Brazilian-German government consultations in eight years as Latin America and Europe's largest economies seek to revive ties.Lula has jetted across the globe since returning to office in January, trying to restore Brazil's standing on the global stage after years of diplomatic isolation under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, to mixed results.He is expected to have dinner on Sunday with fellow leftist, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, before the consultations on Monday.Scholz was the first foreign leader to visit Lula in Brazil, only weeks after his inauguration.The German Chancellor has been on a quest since taking office in late 2021 to improve ties with the Global South. Germany also considers Brazil a key partner in its bid to diversify its trade, in part to reduce its reliance on China, and plug a gap in skilled labour.Both countries are pushing for a quick trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur, South America's major trading bloc, over which Brazil currently presides.""It is known that we support and strive for this agreement and also want it to be concluded really swiftly,"" a spokesperson for the German economy ministry said on Friday.A trade treaty was agreed in principle in 2019 after two decades of talks, but additional environmental commitments demanded by the EU led Brazil and Argentina to seek new concessions that prolonged negotiations.""Free-trade agreements open access to new markets that in particular the export-oriented German economy can benefit from,"" said Lukas Koehler, a senior lawmaker with the Free Democrats (FDP), junior partner in Scholz's three-way coalition.German exports to Brazil, however, have grown by only 3% in the past ten years, compared with 38% and 87% for U.S. and Chinese exports to Brazil respectively, according to the Latin America Committee of German Business.Scholz will be hoping to avoid a scenario such as in January, when his visit to Brazil was overshadowed by differences over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This time, the news conference on Monday afternoon could highlight their differences over the Israel-Hamas war.Lula last month said that Israel was ""committing terrorism"" against Palestinians ""by not taking into account that children are not at war, that women are not at war"". Scholz, by contrast, has avoided such criticism and continuously backed Israel's ""right to defend itself"".",2498,https://www.reuters.com/world/lula-berlin-first-brazil-germany-talks-eight-years-2023-12-03/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/MT6YB76RZBNIZKGZJS5GPFIDJM.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,expect market dinner highlight brazilian continuously mercosur land presides quick improve democrat respectively environmental lawmaker israel inacio demand lukas bolsonaro considers trading currently negotiation reuters restore agreement argentina talk jet leftist south commit gap koehler dec stand scenario major particular accord child china chancellor office overshadow invasion sunday january plug concession reliance mixed bid ukraine economy criticism reduce terrorism russia ministry news fellow lead key partner berlin president free hop benefit union german swiftly scholz week government quest month woman decade prolong tie year push conclude european skilled olaf stage jair treaty senior spokesperson seek avoid contrast afternoon trade america chinese export defend predecessor consultation back support germany diversify foreign lula commitment monday luiz return principle country access past deal time part junior ten silva agree global conference grown late compare latin isolation additional open palestinian strive visit revive fdp large bloc diplomatic globe brazil difference account europe leader committee,0.94475,0.1200960768614891,11.725201793721975,0.3399019961519962,0,2023-12-03
CNN,"When Gaza lost phone and internet connection under Israeli attack, this activist found a way to get Palestinians back online",2023-12-03 15:35:00,Alaa Elassar,"Mirna El Helbawi sits on a Cairo rooftop, her face illuminated by the moonlight and a phone in her hands, as she texts a terrified father whose wife and children are trapped in Gaza.“I don’t want a single thing from this world right now,” he writes to her in Arabic, “except to be able to talk to them, even if it’s for the last time, let me tell them goodbye.”El Helbawi, more than 200 miles away, can’t shield his family from the Israeli missiles raining down. But she can provide them with the chance to say one more “I love you.”The Egyptian writer and activist is the founder of Connecting Gaza, a grassroots initiative that uses eSIMs – or virtual SIM cards – to help Palestinians skirt telecommunication blackouts amid Israeli airstrikes across the territory.El Helbawi, along with a small group of volunteers and a legion of international donors, says they’ve restored telephone and internet connection to more than 200,000 Palestinians in Gaza, and will continue the effort until the devastating war between Israel and Hamas is over.“The right to telephone and internet access is a basic human right just as important as food and water,” El Helbawi, 31, told CNN. Without the ability to communicate, Palestinian civilians caught in the line of fire are unable to check on each other or call for help; emergency and medical workers can’t coordinate their responses; and journalists can’t document atrocities on the ground, including possible war crimes, she says.“After all this pain, they can’t even share their grief with the world or scream for people to demand a ceasefire. They have to endure bombardment and attacks in absolute silence,” El Helbawi said.“It’s like being murdered while someone is putting a hand over your mouth, so you can’t even scream for help.”El Helbawi, like millions of others, has been anxiously watching the war unfold since October 7, when Hamas launched a brazen attack in Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 others hostage.Israel responded by imposing a siege and launching deadly airstrikes across Gaza, destroying homes, schools and hospitals in the densely populated territory. An estimated 15,200 Palestinians, 70% of whom are women and children, have so far been killed in the attacks, and 40,000 others wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which draws its figures from sources in Hamas-run Gaza.Almost immediately, telecommunication services experienced disruptions. Israel cut electricity to the territory and service providers said the bombardment destroyed vital network infrastructure. Some Palestinians were still able to make telephone calls and access the internet, but connection was spotty.For weeks, El Helbawi followed the news closely. Images and videos posted on social media broke her heart – entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble; doctors struggling to treat patients without medicine; parents mourning the deaths of their children.Then on October 27, as Israel prepared to expand its ground operations, Gaza fell silent.“We regret to announce a complete disruption of all communication and internet services with the Gaza Strip in light of the ongoing aggression,” Paltel, the leading telecommunication company in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement. It was the first of several blackouts to strike Gaza.Fearful that a blackout could provide cover for “war crimes,” El Helbawi became consumed with finding a solution.At first, she joined others on social media platform X, calling for Elon Musk to deliver his Starlink satellite internet service to Gaza – and was excited when Musk said he would. But when talks on those plans stalled, El Helbawi decided to try something else.At the suggestion of a social media follower, she purchased an eSIM with roaming service and had a friend try to connect to a foreign network. To her surprise, it worked.“I felt it in my whole body the moment we realized there was hope – even if it was very small hope – that we found a solution,” El Helbawi said. “It was the light at the end of a very dark tunnel.”Within 24 hours, she posted on X and Instagram asking followers who wanted to help restore telephone and internet for Palestinians to donate eSIMs by purchasing them online and sending her the QR codes. El Helbawi felt confident she could find people in Gaza with service to distribute the eSIMs throughout the territory.As El Helbawi began executing her plan, Ahmed Elmadhoun was in Gaza struggling with how to report on the war without telephone or internet service.As one of the few journalists on the ground, Elmadhoun felt obligated to keep the world informed of the latest news, sharing photos and videos of the aftermath on social media.“It’s a significant responsibility,” Elmadhoun, 27, told CNN. “People here are dying in silence, and no one can hear them. We are the voice of all these victims.”He also worried about his family, who were displaced throughout Gaza and could not be reached. More than 40 of his relatives were killed in airstrikes, Elmadhoun says.“Gaza was incredibly isolated, with only fear present. We were alone, very alone,” he said. “We couldn’t reach our families or inquire about them, and the airstrikes were incredibly intense. Even the ambulance and emergency teams couldn’t determine the locations of the bombings or reach the injured.”Amid his fears, Elmadhoun managed to access the internet using an Israeli SIM card before it was blocked. In that time, he posted on X asking: “Someone told me about an eSIM – who?”Minutes later, El Helbawi saw his question and responded: “Me! Me! Me! Send me a message urgently.”El Helbawi quickly gave Elmadhoun an eSIM QR code and helped reconnect him to the internet, making him the first person in Gaza to get one.At that moment, Connecting Gaza was born.News of the initiative quickly spread on social media, with concerned people from all over the world buying and donating eSIMs.Donors have sent QR codes from as far as the United States, Switzerland, Pakistan and the Netherlands, El Helbawi says. Most buy them on mobile apps like Simly and Airalo, which allow donors to see when the eSIMs are activated and top them off when funds run low.Graeme Bradley, a donor from Scotland, says he was drawn to the initiative because it’s an easy way to have a big impact on a conflict where so many lives are at stake.“It’s horrific to see the level of destruction and death inflicted on innocent civilians living in an occupied territory with nowhere to go,” Bradley, 38, told CNN. “There is no escape for them.”By helping Palestinians tell their stories, he hopes they’ll be able to “turn public opinion and pressure world leaders to call for a ceasefire.”But not everyone who gets an eSIM lives long enough to tell their story.Noha Elkomi, a 25-year-old donor from Egypt, says she excitedly watched on her app as a Palestinian activated the eSIM she donated. But when it fell inactive, her heart sank.She shared her concerns with El Helbawi, who told her, “You never know what happens,” Elkomi recalled.“I understood what she said. Maybe the first one who took it is gone. Maybe they got killed. This is the reality of it, as sad as it is. Every minute counts and you don’t know how long they are staying,” Elkomi said.An eSIM can only be activated once, and it can go inactive depending on where in Gaza the person is trying to connect. If they move to an area with weaker signal, the eSIM might not work.“This gave me a little bit of hope but at the same time it made me start imagining, what would the person be going through? Where are they now?” Elkomi said. “… I started feeling as if I know them personally.”The first eSIM she donated eventually lost signal altogether, Elkomi says, but she won’t stop giving more. Days later, tears streamed from Elkomi’s eyes as she saw her second eSIM go online and connect another person in Gaza.“I will say that regardless of what stops in front of them, they (Palestinians) find a way to go around it or climb on top of it or to break through it and continue thriving and this is what they want to show the world,” Elkomi said. “The blackout was, yes, some darkness, but there’s always going to be light shining through the darkness.”El Helbawi admits she’s obsessed with Connecting Gaza. It’s the first thing she thinks about in the morning and the last thing at night.“We barely sleep, connecting eSIMs is our first priority in life,” she said. “Even though I feel like I’m doing something big for Gaza, I can never stop feeling that still we are not doing enough.”To date, an estimated $1.3 million worth of eSIMs have been donated to Connecting Gaza for distribution, according to El Helbawi. The initiative, which partnered with Simly for a time, connects more than 1,000 Palestinians daily, and each person can turn a phone into a hotspot for five others, she says.Connecting Gaza has been so successful that El Helbawi recently leveraged her growing social media following into a nonprofit organization called Connecting Humanity, through which she hopes to reconnect vulnerable people in other conflict zones.“The eSIMs are not cheap. To know that so many people are spending their time and money to help says so much about the solidarity the world has with Palestine,” El Helbawi said. “Some people donate eSIMs and then wait for their next paychecks to send another. They do this to save someone’s life. This is humanity.”The war has significantly changed since the first blackout. There was a short-lived truce, some hostages released, and more aid allowed to enter Gaza. But the violence has resumed and more than a million Palestinians remain displaced, their homes destroyed, little access to health care, food, clean water or electricity – and no means of escape.The grief and isolation Palestinians feel is compounded by the frequent blackouts, Elmadhoun says: “What’s happening in Gaza is a massacre.

New York Times,Israel-Hamas WarIsrael’s Military Expands Evacuation Orders in Southern Gaza,2023-12-03 14:37:00,"Vivian Yee, Ameera Harouda, Helene Cooper, Andrés R. Martínez, Cassandra Vinograd, Peter Baker, Karoun Demirjian, Zach Levitt, Amy Schoenfeld Walker, Adam Sella, Gaya Gupta","Britain will start surveillance flights over Gaza to help locate hostages.The U.S. is pressing Israel and Hamas to return to talks, a White House official says.Eighty percent of Gazans have already left their homes. Here’s what that looks like.Released hostages give Tel Aviv protesters hope for those left behind.A university president was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, Palestinian officials say.Confusion and fear gripped much of southern Gaza on Sunday as Israel’s military ordered more residents to clear out, sending people into the streets in search of anything that might serve as shelter. Israeli airstrikes continued two days after a cease-fire deal fell apart.The Israeli military’s latest evacuation orders appeared to be setting the stage for a ground invasion in the south since hostilities started again after the collapse of a weeklong truce with Hamas. They evoked similar orders given by the Israeli military before it invaded northern Gaza in late October, and Israeli officials said they were intended to move civilians out of harm’s way.“Dear residents of Gaza, obeying evacuation instructions is the safest way to preserve your safety, your lives and the lives of your families,” Israel’s military wrote on Arabic-language accounts on Facebook and X on Sunday, providing a growing list of areas that were under the evacuation order.But the announcements were confusing or prone to change with almost no notice, leaving many Gazans unsure about whether to flee and with little time to do so.The list of areas ordered to clear out swelled from 19 the previous morning to 34 on Sunday, all clustered southeast of the city of Khan Younis. The Israeli military marked each on a map of Gaza that divided the territory into nearly 2,400 “blocks,” advising residents to pay attention to Israeli announcements about whether their block was being evacuated.Some families whose homes and shelters were not included in the initial evacuation areas, and who had thought they would be able to stay put, said they had later received recorded calls ordering them to leave.The United Nations said it was unclear whether many Gazans had been able to see the online map, given the continued electricity blackout and spotty communications.Many people under evacuation orders had already been displaced at least once before, forced to leave northern Gaza when the fighting and the airstrikes began. Now they found themselves once again at a loss for where to go in an already overcrowded area under threat of bombardment.Families spilled from their apartments, carrying mattresses and blankets, and searching for wood and whatever else they could find to build makeshift shelters, according to Yousef Hammash, an advocacy officer for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Khan Younis.“I cannot overstate the fear, panic & confusion that these Israeli maps are causing civilians in Gaza, including my own staff,” wrote Melanie Ward, head of the humanitarian organization Medical Aid for Palestinians, on social media, adding that “people cannot run from place to place to try to escape Israel’s bombs.”On Sunday afternoon, a spokesman for the Gazan health ministry, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, said 316 people had been killed in Israeli strikes “in the past hours.” He said that more than 15,500 people had been killed since Oct. 7, when the war began.Hospitals in the south were also under pressure. A team from the World Health Organization visited a hospital in Khan Younis on Saturday that was three times over its capacity, according to the agency’s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“Countless people were seeking shelter, filling every corner of the facility,” he wrote on X. “Patients were receiving care on the floor, screaming in pain.”Ron Dermer, Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that the military was trying to protect civilians as it pushed toward its goal of eliminating Hamas. “We’re going to do it in the deliberate fashion because we are very conscious of having civilians there, and getting them out of harm’s way,” he said. “If we wanted to do it fast, we’d harm a lot more civilians.”Mr. Dermer added that he did not know how long it would take for Israel to achieve its goal. “I don’t know if it’s going to be months,” he said.The Israeli military’s evacuation map showed big orange arrows directing people toward already-overflowing shelters or what it called the “humanitarian zone” in Al-Mawasi, an agricultural area toward the Mediterranean Sea. Gazans who made it there said it was filling quickly with evacuees.But it was not clear whether the zone provided sufficient supplies or shelter, with some Gazans who fled there describing no shelters against the cold, no food for sale but for the few vegetables hawked by roving vendors, few bathrooms and no visible presence of humanitarian aid.The idea of “safe zones” in Gaza, as was envisioned for Al-Mawasi, is opposed by the United Nations. Last month, U.N. agencies and other groups said they would not participate in setting up any such zones in Gaza.Yara Bayoumy contributed reporting.— Vivian Yee and Ameera HaroudaA U.S. Navy destroyer came under attack in the Red Sea on Sunday, the Pentagon said, in what could signal another escalation in the tit-for-tat attacks between the American military and Iranian-backed militants.A Pentagon official said the U.S.S. Carney, along with several commercial ships nearby, came under fire for several hours beginning around 10 a.m. Sunday. The destroyer intercepted at least one drone during the attack, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.The official did not say where the attacks originated. But since Hamas’s Oct. 7 incursion into Israel, the Iran-backed Houthi militia based in Yemen has launched a series of attacks — including with drones and missiles — on Israeli and American targets in the Red Sea.A Houthi military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, said in a statement on Sunday that the militia had targeted two Israeli ships in the area of the Bab al-Mandeb strait off southern Yemen, but did not mention the American naval vessel. The group fired a missile at one ship and targeted a second with a drone, he said, adding that the Houthis would continue to prevent Israeli ships from sailing in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until Israel’s military “stops its aggression” in Gaza.In October, the Carney shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched from Yemen that the Pentagon said might have been headed toward Israel.After Hamas attacked Israel, the Biden administration rushed two aircraft carriers and additional troops to the eastern Mediterranean near Israel to deter Iran and its proxies in the region from expanding the war.Sunday’s attack underscored the risks that the fight in Gaza could spiral into a wider conflict. For more than a month, Iranian-backed militias have conducted drone and rocket attacks against the 2,500 American troops based in Iraq and the 900 troops in Syria.Shuaib Almosawa contributed reporting.— Helene CooperHalf of all buildings in northern Gaza are damaged or destroyed, according to satellite analysis estimates.Top U.S. officials have urged Israel to do more to spare civilians in the Gaza Strip amid signs that Israel’s military is preparing a ground invasion in the south of the enclave, where Gazans who have fled the nearly two months of fighting are sheltering.With the collapse of a weeklong cease-fire with Hamas and the resumption of Israeli military operations, Biden administration officials have been pushing for more targeted strikes to try to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza. American officials have been making clear to Israel that it must not pursue a campaign in southern Gaza that would have the same devastating consequences as in the north.Israeli air and ground strikes have killed more than 15,000 people, by the Gazan health authorities’ count, since Oct. 7. On that day, Hamas-led attacks killed at least 1,200 people in southern Israel, according to Israeli officials.Vice President Kamala Harris, who met with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt on Saturday in Dubai, also rejected the idea of moving Gazans into refugee camps or forcefully out of Gaza or the West Bank. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, in a speech on Saturday in California, cited his experience fighting urban battles in Iraq as he urged Israel to better protect civilians or else risk a strategic defeat against Hamas.“The lesson is that you can only win in urban warfare by protecting civilians,” Mr. Austin said.Israel has issued new evacuation orders in the south of Gaza, evoking similar orders that the military gave before invading northern Gaza in late October. That has added to the fear and uncertainty hanging over Gaza’s 2.2 million people as a new phase appears to be opening in the war. The latest evacuation orders could prompt residents in a large swath of territory along the Israeli border to flee.Reporting was contributed by Julian Barnes, Patrick Kingsley, Rawan Sheikh Ahmad, Iyad Abuheweila and Michael D. Shear.— Andrés R. MartínezBritain will carry out surveillance flights over the Gaza Strip to help locate hostages, the country’s defense minister said on Sunday, mirroring a similar effort by the United States.Two Pentagon officials and an analysis by The New York Times last month confirmed that the U.S. military was flying surveillance drones over the Gaza Strip to aid hostage recovery efforts. Roughly 240 hostages were taken to Gaza in the surprise Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7. A seven-day truce led to the release of 105, but more than 100 remain in captivity, according to Israeli officials, and fighting has resumed.On Sunday, Britain’s defense secretary, Grant Shapps, reiterated calls for Hamas to release all hostages and said British aircraft would begin flying over Gaza to “aid ongoing rescue efforts.”Mr. Shapps wrote on X that British hostages were still being held by Hamas. “Their freedom is our utmost priority,” he wrote.In a separate statement, the Ministry of Defense said the aircraft will “be unarmed, do not have a combat role and will be tasked solely to locate hostages.” It added that “only information relating to hostage rescue” would be shared with “the relevant authorities.”Surveillance flights will initially be carried out by Shadow R1 manned aircraft, according to a spokesman for Britain’s defense ministry. He spoke on the condition that he not be named, in line with policy.— Cassandra VinogradThe U.S. government is making an intense effort to persuade Israel and Hamas to resume negotiations so they can once again pause hostilities and exchange more prisoners for hostages, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.“We are still working it really hard, hour by hour, to see if we can get the sides back to the table and see if we can get something moving,” John F. Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the White House National Security Council, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “We would like that to happen today. But honestly, I just don’t know.”In appearances on several Sunday talk shows, Mr. Kirby emphasized that Hamas was to blame for the breakdown in talks, saying that it had not lived up to the terms of its original agreement to begin handing over captives held in Gaza. He said Hamas had failed to produce a list of women and children who could be released in addition to the 105 hostages who were freed during the original pause in fighting. Among those still held are eight or nine Americans.Israel has since resumed its assault on Hamas, and Mr. Kirby urged it to avoid civilian casualties, while crediting its forces with making efforts to do so. He said Israeli authorities had been open to U.S. advice about how to make their assault more precise.“We believe that they have been receptive to our messages here in terms of trying to minimize civilian casualties,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” He noted that Israel had published a map directing civilians to what it said were safe zones.“There’s not a whole lot of modern militaries that would do that, I mean, that is, to telegraph their punches in that way,” he said. “So they are making an effort.”President Biden and his administration have sought to straddle a careful line nearly two months after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack in which Hamas killed an estimated 1,200 people in Israel and took about 240 more hostage. While supporting Israel’s right to defend itself, the administration has also sought to restrain Israel from what it believes would be going too far in its response.That led to criticism from both the left and the right on Sunday, as some Republicans complained that Mr. Biden’s team was trying to hold Israel back, while some liberal Democrats complained that it was not doing that enough.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, singled out Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III. In a speech on Saturday, Mr. Austin warned that Israel should protect civilians in Gaza and prevent violence against Palestinians by Jewish settlers in the West Bank, because otherwise “you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Mr. Graham castigated Mr. Austin, a retired four-star general who fought in Iraq. “He’s so naïve; I mean I just lost all confidence in this guy,” Mr. Graham said.“If we were attacked like this, which we were on 9/11, if somebody called for us within two months to have a cease-fire against Al Qaeda, we’d have laughed them out of town, we’d have run them out of town,” Mr. Graham added. “Secretary Austin is telling Israel things that are impossible to achieve.”Mr. Graham said his solution to the hostage impasse would be to threaten Iran, the sponsor of Hamas. “I would go to Iran and say listen, you need to tell Hamas to let these hostages go,” he said. “If you don’t, you’re going to start paying a heavier price.”On the other side of the ideological spectrum, Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, said on the same program that the Biden administration had a responsibility to stop Israel from killing so many civilians.“The United States cannot be backers of this kind of indiscriminate bombing — that is my firm belief,” she said. “We should have conditions on military aid in the same way that we do for every other country.”While the White House blamed Hamas for the breakdown in hostage talks, Ms. Jayapal faulted Israel.“Qatar has said that Hamas is still at the table,” she said, referring to the Persian Gulf emirate that has served as the intermediary for the talks. “Israel should still be at the table. In fact, some of the Israeli hostages are saying that Israel should still be at the table, because this is complex negotiation and it doesn’t happen unless both sides are willing to come to some kind of an agreement.”— Peter Baker and Karoun Demirjian Reporting from WashingtonAs many as 1.8 million Gazans have been forced to leave their homes since Israel began its bombardment in response to the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7. That number is expected to rise after Israel issued new evacuation orders on Saturday and Sunday for areas in the south.Gaza has never experienced so much internal displacement in such a short time. Earlier conflicts forced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes, but experts on refugees said the current war had displaced an unprecedented number of people within the enclave’s 140 square miles.With Israel barring most Gazans from leaving and shelters swelling to many times their capacity, humanitarian aid workers say there is no safe place to go as the fighting continues.Here’s a look at what the displacement in Gaza looks like.— Zach Levitt and Amy Schoenfeld WalkerEighty percent of Gazans are displaced from their homes as Israel orders more evacuations. See where thousands have been sheltering amid the war’s destruction.Yelena Trupanob, 50, a Russian Israeli hostage who was released from captivity in Gaza three days ago, had a message for the thousands of demonstrators who gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to continue to pressure the Israeli government to make freeing the remaining hostages a top priority.“I came to say thank you,” Ms. Trupanob said. “Because without all of you, I wouldn’t be here.”In her first public appearance since being released, Ms. Trupanob was joined onstage in front of the central military headquarters in Tel Aviv by her mother, Irena Tati, 73. She was also one of the 105 hostages — including Israelis, Thais and other foreign citizens — who have been released and returned to Israel.Most were freed as part of a seven-day cease-fire that ended Friday morning local time. With roughly 240 hostages taken in the surprise Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, more than 100 hostages remain in captivity, according to Israeli officials.Ms. Trupanob, her son, Sasha, 28, and Ms. Tati were kidnapped from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7. Mr. Trupanob is still being held in Gaza. Her husband, Vitaly Trupanob, was murdered in the attack.“Now, we have to continue, to return my Sasha, and everyone,” Ms. Trupanob said at the demonstration. After repeating the message in Russian, her voice cracked with emotion as she chanted “Right now!” with the crowd.Tears flowed more freely and chants to “bring them home now” were louder than in the previous weeks of rallies in Tel Aviv, as protesters celebrated the return of some hostages and lamented the many still in captivity.Michal Lebenthal, who is the same age as Ms. Trupanob, said she was moved by her speech because “as a mother she wants her son to come back, and I feel the same.”Before the temporary cease-fire, thousands of people rallied outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem to call on the government to do more to free hostages held in Gaza, the culmination of a five-day march from Tel Aviv that began with just 100 friends and family of the captives. But with the military operations resuming in Gaza, families of the hostages say they feel as if they are back to square one.Amit Shem Tov, 24, whose younger brother Omer, 21, is still being held in Gaza, said, “The end of the cease-fire is the worst thing that could have happened because it seriously delays the release of my brother.”Seeing Ms. Trupanob at the rally filled Mr. Shem Tov with hope, and a bit of jealousy. “I wish next Saturday we’ll be here with him,” Mr. Shem Tov said, but until his brother returns, he added that he would continue to put as much pressure as possible on the government to secure the release of the remaining hostages.— Adam Sella reporting from Tel AvivA university president and well-known physics professor was killed along with his family on Saturday in an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education said.The professor, Sofyan Taya, a longtime and prolific scholar in the field of optics who served as the president of the Islamic University of Gaza, was slain when Israeli warplanes hit buildings in Jabaliya just north of Gaza City, the ministry said. It did not identify the other members of his family.BREAKING:Professor Sufian Tayeh, who headed the largest university in #Gaza, killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Jabalia refugee camp.He was ranked among the top 2% of researchers globally & was appointed UNESCO chair for Physical & Astrophysical sciences in Palestine. pic.twitter.com/lqEvhN3Wp5Mr. Taya was listed on Stanford University’s compilation of most-cited scientists around the world in 2021 and 2022, with a listed specialty of optics. His research has amassed more than 3,700 citations, according to his Google Scholar page. He wrote in his profile on ResearchGate, a social network for scientists, that his research focused on fibers, optical sensing and slab waveguides.Mr. Taya was also a chair in astronomy, astrophysics and space sciences for UNESCO, the United Nations cultural organization. The position was meant to partner up the Islamic University of Gaza and UNESCO to facilitate research.An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Taya’s death.It remained unclear if Mr. Taya was a target of the airstrike. The Israeli military has claimed that the Islamic University of Gaza is linked to Hamas operations. In October, the Israeli military struck the university, claiming that it was an “important operational, political and military center” belonging to Hamas and that it had been used as a training camp for Hamas military intelligence operatives, according to a statement. The Israeli military has also said that the university maintained close ties with the senior leadership of Hamas.— Gaya

Washington Post,A dictatorship takes on Miss Universe and a beauty-queen ‘coup’,2023-12-03 14:15:00,Mary Beth Sheridan,"MEXICO CITY — As Nicaragua has marched steadily toward dictatorship in recent years, its government has attacked opposition politicians, the Catholic Church, journalists and universities.Now it’s going after the beauty queens.Just when authorities appeared to have squelched all forms of dissent, a willowy 23-year-old Nicaraguan, Sheynnis Palacios, won the Miss Universe pageant on Nov. 18. People poured into the streets of the Central American country in jubilation. The government initially praised the victory — then photos emerged of Palacios taking part in mass anti-government protests in 2018, which were eventually crushed by security forces.Since the pageant, the soft-spoken Palacios has become a symbol of national pride and Nicaraguans’ longing for change. Now President Daniel Ortega’s government is striking back.On Friday night, Nicaraguan police accused the family that operates the country’s Miss Universe franchise of “conspiring against the nation.” A police statement said Karen Celebertti, a former beauty queen who has run the Miss Nicaragua contest since 2001, had used “spaces supposedly dedicated to promoting ‘innocent’ beauty pageants,” in a foreign-backed plot to boost the opposition. Her husband and son were also named in the complaint.Analysts said the attack on the Miss Universe franchise was the latest sign of paranoia from a government that has jailed or deported nearly all opposition leaders, stripped news organizations of their licenses and imprisoned Catholic bishops and priests.“It’s this weird amalgam of fear on their part, combined with a sense of impunity,” said Ricardo Zúniga, a senior adviser at the U.S. Institute of Peace and former top State Department official for Latin America affairs.Rosario Murillo, Ortega’s wife and government spokeswoman, did not respond to an email seeking comment.Ortega, now 78, helped lead a leftist revolution that toppled Anastasio Somoza, a right-wing dictator, in 1979. More than four decades later, Nicaragua remains one of the poorest and most politically oppressed countries in the Western Hemisphere. Since the crushing of the 2018 protests, the number of Nicaraguans fleeing to seek U.S. asylum has surged. A recent study by AmericasBarometer found that half the population wanted to emigrate.Palacios was the first Central American to win Miss Universe, and her triumph brought a rare moment of joy to the downtrodden nation. But the government appeared unnerved as people took to the streets in celebration, waving Nicaragua’s blue-and-white flag. That’s a jailable offense in a country where the flag has become a symbol of protest. Murillo, who is also vice president, blasted the demonstrators for trying to “convert a beautiful and justified moment of pride and celebration into a destructive coup.”The security forces sprang into action. When Celebertti flew home after the pageant on Nov. 23, she was barred from entering Nicaragua, according to media reports. She’s reported to be in Mexico. On Tuesday, police detained her husband and son at their home in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, according to media reports. The government has not provided information about their whereabouts.The police document said that Celebertti, her husband and son had participated in the 2018 anti-government protests. After the uprising was extinguished — in a crackdown that claimed more than 300 lives — the family maintained contact with “supporters of treason,” according to the complaint. They allegedly turned the Miss Nicaragua pageants into “political ambushes” aimed at undermining the government with support from “foreign agents,” the police said.Celebertti’s lawyers and relatives declined to comment on the case. Palacios, who won the Miss Nicaragua contest in August, was not named in the statement.The police statement warned that Celebertti, her husband and son would “have to serve sentences set out by Nicaraguan law.” They face charges including organized crime and funding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. (It wasn’t clear whether the weapon was Miss Universe.)Palacios might seem an unlikely threat to the Ortega government. She’s not even in Nicaragua; she recently moved to New York for her Miss Universe duties. Her old Facebook account, on which she had posted photos of herself at the 2018 protests, has been taken down. She hasn’t said anything publicly about the country’s politics.Still, she exudes the kind of appeal that could be difficult for Ortega to counter.While Palacios wowed the Miss Universe audience with her elegance, sweeping across the stage in a silver gown and light blue cape, she comes from a humble background. She put herself through college by winning scholarships and selling buñuelos, a sweet fried treat.She has emphasized her Catholic faith, at a time when the church in Nicaragua is under siege. The government has practically severed relations with the Vatican and seized control of Palaciaos’s alma mater, the Jesuit-run University of Central America.“She is deeply Nicaraguan, in a way that appeals to almost everyone,” Zúniga said. “There’s nobody on the General Staff who’s saying, ‘I wish we could clock her on the head and drag her to jail.’”The United States, the European Union and Canada have slapped sanctions on senior officials in Ortega’s government, including Murillo, for anti-democratic behavior and corruption. Yet they have not appeared to make much difference. In January 2022, Ortega was inaugurated for a fourth consecutive presidential term, after what the Biden administration called a “pantomime election” with no real competition allowed.Nicaragua’s government has asserted ever more control over social and political life in the last few years, closing down more than 3,000 nongovernmental organizations, including Mother Teresa’s missionaries and a local branch of the Rotary Club. Authorities have accused some of being foreign agents.But can it control a beauty queen? Last month, police stopped some artists in the northern city of Estelí from painting a mural of Miss Universe, according to media reports. The image was painted over. But in a video making the rounds on social media, a Nicaraguan rapper known as Witto El Menor sings an homage to the beauty queen.“In your silhouette, I see my flag,” he raps, holding aloft the blue-and-white Nicaraguan flag. “You reflect the constant fight of our country to get ahead.”",6414,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/03/nicaragua-miss-universe-daniel-ortega-sheynnis-palacios/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,palaciaos central deport competition franchise national asylum control medium pantomime enter offense social action maintain steadily weird number plot homage adviser population assert witto change uprise claimed august statement complaint leftist comment rotary email foreign allegedly put authority universe journalist top american murillo call elegance organization make deeply presidential leader official fear lead western moment political miss tuesday staff video sell triumph beautiful sweep celebration brought contact gown half strip symbol aloft kind difficult celebertti slap surge wowed sheynnis beauty justified nicaragua force stage head vice hold country supporter consecutive senior photo dedicate convert blue funding detain image clear difference crackdown artist topple european undermine publicly jubilation innocent remains set life fry mass york run siege queen willowy biden poorest street government proliferation zúniga fourth catholic nongovernmental president corruption latin initially somoza spokeswoman sweet warn general administration provide time real combine news late faith relation account protest buñuelos jail attack operates imprison part managua seize constant treason blast conspire found accord sings estelí post license supposedly dictatorship scholarship march mural missionary canada northern paranoia stop college audience pageant boost nation relative round local praise branch state crime humble accuse city recently silver sanction department peace behavior destruction emphasize pride duty downtrodden destructive clock institute wave silhouette closing club seek joy inaugurate charge jailable crush security turn sentence eventually win alma ahead facebook aim home dissent sprang dictator fight paint rap flew family term daniel year opposition police strike husband lawyer move wife study light recent form revolution union mother politician demonstrator appeal oppress wish case report america impunity extinguish reflect background document mexico space ricardo vatican flag night rare rapper mater anastasio support painting organize bishop information january bar amalgam exudes church ortega unnerved decade menor nicaraguan palacios participate month ambush respond threat sign practically squelch politically victory contest united decline weapon university teresa include hemisphere flee cape serve promote drag sever former emerge election americasbarometer friday longing capital agent,0.2584999999999999,0.0467726847521047,10.961763180639585,0.339002033320215,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,Gaza civilians find no good options to escape widening Israeli strikes,2023-12-03 13:59:00,"Miriam Berger, Hannah Allam","AMMAN, Jordan — Israel on Sunday launched strikes in northern and southern Gaza, hitting densely populated areas where it says Hamas militants are hiding, and squeezing civilians into ever smaller patches of territory as options dwindle for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians seeking refuge.Casualties appeared to be heaviest in the already hard-hit north, where fresh strikes on the Jabalya refugee camp came Sunday as residents were still reeling from a barrage the day before, according to local news reports. Meanwhile, Israel signaled a widening of operations with new evacuation warnings in the southern hub of Khan Younis, where Palestinians already displaced from the north had been instructed to move.Aid agencies and fleeing Palestinians say the scattered strike locations and mixed messages from Israel about where to go have sown panic and confusion, leaving families no clear path to safety amid intense bombardment and a dire humanitarian crisis.The Gaza Health Ministry on Sunday counted at least 316 people killed and another 664 wounded in the past 24 hours, adding that the number was likely to rise as bodies were retrieved from the rubble. More than 15,500 people have been killed and over 41,000 wounded in Gaza since the war began, the ministry said Sunday.“We are killed twice: Once because of bombing and destruction, and again because of harsh living conditions, fear and terror,” said Emad, a 56-year-old schoolteacher who wouldn’t give his last name for security reasons. He said his large family, staying at a shelter in central Khan Younis, had already relocated four times. “They told us to move south, and we moved. Now there is no farther than that. Where do we go?”Where to go is the key question for Palestinians in Gaza, with an estimated 1.8 million people – or 80 percent of the population – now internally displaced, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Under increasingly public pressure from the Biden administration and other Western allies over the high civilian toll, Israel posted maps online that it said would better help Palestinians make their way to a “safer” zone. But aid groups and displaced families say the grids lack specifics and direct people to areas that are inaccessible, overcrowded or under attack.The leaflets include a QR code for more information, but much of the enclave is operating in near-blackout conditions, with sporadic phone or internet service.“I cannot overstate the fear, panic & confusion that these Israeli maps are causing civilians in #Gaza, including my own staff,” Melanie Ward, head of the relief group Medical Aid for Palestinians, posted on X, formerly Twitter. “People cannot run from place to place to try to escape Israel’s bombs, nor does international law expect them to. What is being done is unconscionable.”In the maps, Israel designated about 25 percent of the Gaza Strip for evacuation, according to OCHA. The aid agency said one of the zones — a roughly 27-square-mile area east of Khan Younis — was home to about 352,000 people before the start of the conflict.In recent days, Biden administration officials have issued pointed calls for Israel to do more to avoid civilian casualties in the nearly two-month-old war, which erupted Oct. 7 after Hamas militants killed at least 1,200 people and abducted scores of others in a devastating attack inside Israel.Israel responded with military operations that have turned Gaza into what U.N. Secretary General António Guterres has called “hell on earth,” with women and children making up around 70 percent of the death toll.Israel laments the scale of the loss of civilian life in Gaza but holds Hamas responsible for it, government spokesman Eylon Levy said Sunday.“The Israeli army has made every effort upholding our obligations under international law to get civilians out of harm’s way,” he said.On Sunday, local journalists in Khan Younis posted footage showing frantic efforts to retrieve casualties after strikes in the city. The videos showed collapsed buildings and homes sheared of their facades. Men with bloodied, limp children in their arms were filmed racing toward an ambulance.The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called the heavy bombardment “petrifying” in a post late Saturday on X, formerly Twitter. A WHO team that visited Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, he wrote, found the facility packed to three times its capacity, with patients “receiving care on the floor, screaming in pain.”In northern Gaza, too, bloody scenes followed strikes on the Jabalya refugee camp and in the Shejaiya neighborhood east of Gaza City.Al Jazeera reported that an entire residential block of the Jabalya camp was leveled Sunday, burying dozens of people. Footage from local journalists showed people at the camp, a frequent target of strikes, picking through the smoking wreckage for survivors or corpses.In Shejaiya, residents and rescue workers were still working to retrieve casualties from strikes Saturday that killed or injured hundreds, Palestinian officials said. The health ministry has not issued an official tally. Israel said it killed a local Hamas military commander, Wissam Farhat, in the attack, and said on Sunday that it would continue operations there.Reached by phone, Mohammad, a 43-year-old resident who asked to have his last name withheld for security reasons, said his aunt and her family were among the dozens feared dead in Shejaiya. He recalled hearing a barrage of blasts so intense that his house “shook violently.”After the strikes, Mohammad said, he ran to help and saw that the three-story house where his aunt was sheltering with around 40 other people was “entirely under rubble.” Dozens of other homes also were destroyed, he said, leading to fears about the extent of the dead or wounded who remain under the debris.“The scene was frightening and terrifying — complete destruction,” Mohammad said. “People began digging out the bodies.”Humanitarian officials for weeks have privately – and sometimes publicly – criticized the Biden administration for not leaning on Israel more to curb attacks they describe as disproportionate, indiscriminate, and a form of collective punishment, a violation of international law. Hundreds of new deaths have been reported since fighting resumed Friday after a brief pause for a hostage-swap deal.Speaking on the sidelines of talks with Arab leaders in the United Arab Emirates over the weekend, Vice President Harris said, “Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed,” and called the scenes of carnage from Gaza “devastating.”To some observers, U.S. acknowledgment of the steep losses is welcomed, if late.“Finally, the US says what it should have much earlier,” Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, tweeted Sunday. “The bombardment was indiscriminate from week 1.”",6878,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/03/gaza-war-israel-strikes-civilians/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHB2CGNBBVAUDDRZLS3MUTUZKQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHB2CGNBBVAUDDRZLS3MUTUZKQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHB2CGNBBVAUDDRZLS3MUTUZKQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHB2CGNBBVAUDDRZLS3MUTUZKQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHB2CGNBBVAUDDRZLS3MUTUZKQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHB2CGNBBVAUDDRZLS3MUTUZKQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,local melanie bury scream describe tally administration coordination nasser frequent pressure code lament online place residential uphold frighten withheld qr relief terror building start vice stay hundred medical ghebreyesus blast shejaiya specific form pick humanitarian barrage sunday dire heavy mixed fresh found casualty retrieve ministry central scatter sideline erupt dwindle relocate israeli family khan heaviest scene injured harm innocent punishment extent camp health obligation government populate publicly pause city woman ocha toll dead limp bloody criticize condition estimate friday bombing give confusion small zone write x egeland footage adhanom biden signal follow welcome civilian official harris recent wissam instruct ally internet overstate launch enclave evacuation jazeera overcrowd team past hub amid percent rescue map count fight packed guterres abduct group mohammad message film death indiscriminate flee security arm palestinian living home hell loss large aid issue neighborhood territory patient add leader rubble strike earth shook direct gaza expect reel operating destroyed facility arab devastate move tedros younis number resume capacity ward army work population acknowledgment recall body carnage council entire responsible sown jabalya roughly safer hospital israel observer intense farther earlier panic reason hold disproportionate militant public operation include lean emad talk post south western law high norwegian complete antónio accord child effort office kill strip race frantic sporadic million wound general hamas hour call curb warning level lack schoolteacher twitter formerly news staff resident lead escape widen told international key smoking continue leaflet aunt shear president inside squeeze leave floor phone harsh designate entirely location path farhat spokesman wreckage eylon week world point day thousand increasingly military life destruction commander respond block house violation secretary collapse east amman scale tweet safety northern shelter option seek avoid question steep journalist bombardment united privately facade hiding begin head information weekend collective agency dozen run attack refugee remain petrify worker area inaccessible patch video levy time densely hearing emirate grid hit displace internally turn show ran survivor score terrify late jan rise finally southern visit jordan fear saturday make report organization target bomb north clear receive,-0.9985,0.8287292817679557,11.217059773828751,0.3802529598915141,0,2023-12-03
Reuters,Labour leader Starmer praises Thatcher in bid to woo UK Conservative voters,2023-12-03 13:49:00,not specified,"LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Keir Starmer, leader of Britain's main opposition Labour Party, has praised former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a deeply unpopular figure among many Labour supporters, as he seeks to woo Conservative voters before an election expected next year.Starmer, whose left-wing party is ahead of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives by some 20 points in opinion polls, is seeking to cement that advantage by broadening Labour's appeal to attract voters who have spurned the party in national elections over the past 13 years.Thatcher, dubbed the ""Iron Lady"" by the UK press at the time, was Britain's Conservative leader from 1979 to 1990. She was an extremely divisive figure, hailed by some but loathed by many on the left for crushing trade unions and privatizing swathes of British industry. She died in 2013.""Every moment of meaningful change in modern British politics begins with the realisation that politics must act in service of the British people, rather than dictating to them,"" Starmer wrote in an article for the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.""Margaret Thatcher sought to drag Britain out of its stupor by setting loose our natural entrepreneurialism,"" he wrote, while also paying tribute to former Labour premiers Tony Blair and Clement Attlee.While his message was designed to appeal to traditional Conservatives, it was also an attempt to distance himself from the politics of former Labour leader, veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn, who in 2019 led the party to its worst defeat since the 1930s.After hailing Thatcher, Starmer wrote that Labour had ""changed dramatically in the last three years"".",1639,https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-labour-leader-starmer-praises-thatcher-bid-woo-uk-conservative-voters-2023-12-03/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/Q7IKHZOOOBLETE5YRQWEAITIBA.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,traditional expect broadening loathe attract hail conservative newspaper prime poll pay attempt realisation tribute reuters service distance veteran britain design voter opinion premier unpopular dec british thatcher jeremy keir former dramatically tony uk sunday entrepreneurialism set sought lead moment national privatize corbyn london appeal union rishi press point party telegraph industry socialist praise lady year left change natural sunak spurn politics clement labour seek write trade act divisive begin iron extremely figure ahead stupor article past minister time election advantage defeat blair meaningful modern message deeply starmer crush cement dubbed dictate drag supporter margaret opposition swathe leader loose woo,-0.0136,0.1830384380719951,11.332027027027028,0.3056025641025641,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Harris dashed to Dubai to tackle climate change and war. Each carries high political risks at home,2023-12-03 13:27:00,WILL WEISSERT Associated Press and JOSH BOAK Associated Press,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Filling in for President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris flew to the Middle East to tackle a pair of challenges that have flummoxed White Houses for decades: climate change and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Each carries the risk of political blowback going into next year’s presidential elections.She spent barely 24 hours on the ground in Dubai, less time than it took to get to the United Arab Emirates and then back to Washington.At the U.N. climate conference, when it was announced that “her excellency Kamala Harris” was taking the stage Saturday for remarks, she was not even in the room.Harris' chair sat unoccupied as world leaders assembled for the panel spoke. When she did show up, she gave a short speech, then dashed off quickly, only to be summoned back for a group photo.Harris was delayed because she had been on the telephone with the emir of Qatar regarding the Israel-Hamas war. And she was in a hurry after the climate event for more meetings with Arab leaders as Israeli bombardments resumed in Gaza after a temporary cease-fire.The awkward double booking during Harris’ hastily arranged Dubai trip illustrates a set of tricky — and at times potentially contradictory — policy and political crosscurrents. The Biden administration with its diverse coalition of voters is trying to navigate these crosscurrents just as the 2024 presidential race is heating up.When Harris spoke to reporters after her day of diplomacy, her prepared remarks skipped over the U.S. pledge to commit an additional $3 billion to a climate fund, a development she had cited in her conference speech. To the media, she focused on steps to resolve the war and prepare for what would come next.“We all want this conflict to end as soon as possible, and to ensure Israel’s security and ensure security for the Palestinian people,” Harris said. “We must accelerate efforts to build an enduring peace and that begins with planning for what happens the day after the fighting ends.”Climate and conflict are matters that require a balancing act at home as a possible Biden rematch with former Republican President Donald Trump unfolds.The Democratic administration is staking much of the U.S. economy's future on renewable energy, yet voters are frustrated by gasoline prices that are higher than when Biden took office. Similarly, the war that began on Oct. 7 has exposed a divided between Democrats over Washington's support for Israel and the suffering of Palestinian civilians.As the 81-year-old Biden seeks a second term, Harris, 59, has taken on a larger role promoting his campaign to younger voters.During a monthslong college tour to campuses across the country, the vice president spoke at every stop about the existential threat of climate change, only to have audience members frequently express concern that the administration and the rest of the world are not doing enough.In Dubai, Harris said it was “our duty and our obligation” to do more to move the world away from fossil fuels and limit the increase in average global temperatures. She said the U.S. would contribute $3 billion to a global fund meant to help developing countries better confront climate change and was joining 90-plus nations in promising to double energy efficiency and triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.JL Andrepont, a senior policy analyst at the environmental group 350.org, said the funding pledge was a “cautious but hopeful sign of the power of public pressure.”But Harris stopped short of calling for a phaseout of fossil fuels, something many environmental groups want in order to stop the emissions causing climate change.“We will continue to celebrate the global wins that support justly sourced and implemented renewable energy for all and we won’t stop advocating for a fast, full phaseout of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas,” Andrepont said.There is a similar level of tension among Democratic supporters over the Israel-Hamas war.Polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has shown that 50% of Democrats approve and 46% disapprove — a near split — of how Biden has dealt with the war.Harris reaffirmed the administration's position that Israel must be able to defend itself. Yet her words after hearing from Arab leaders conveyed some frustration with the scale of Israel's response.She described the “scale of civilian suffering” as “devastating"" and said Israel must do more to protect the lives of Palestinians not involved in the fighting. Biden has previously declared the U.S. relationship with Israel was ironclad and his administration is seeking more than $14 billion to support Israel's war efforts.Harris also stressed the importance of a rebuilding process for homes and hospitals in Gaza region.Amber Sherman, chair of the Black Caucus of the Young Democrats of America, said Harris' comments were “encouraging.” Sherman had previously put out a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that said the Palestinians were revolting against occupation by the Israeli government, just as Black Americans had fought against slavery and white supremacy.“It's important that people call out what's happening in Palestine,” Sherman said. “We do want Gaza to be rebuilt and it's important that she mentioned that.”Yet Harris' statements were not entirely reassuring to some critics of the administration's support of Israel.“President Biden and his administration should show their statement in action,” said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""We want the siege to be lifted.""In all, the vice president spent barely 24 hours on the ground in Dubai, less time than the roughly 15 hours each way it took to get there and back from Washington.While Harris was on her way back Sunday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby applauded Israel for having published online a map of where Gaza residents could go to avoid the fighting. He held that out as a sign that Israel was responsive to the kinds of concerns raised by Harris and others.“There’s not a whole lot of modern militaries that would do that,” Kirby said on ABC's “This Week,” “to telegraph their punches in that way.

He was then killed by an Israeli soldier,2023-12-03 12:35:00,TIA GOLDENBERG Associated Press,"TEL AVIV, Israel -- Seconds after Palestinian gunmen began shooting up a busy Jerusalem bus stop last week, Yuval Castleman raced toward the scene and opened fire on the attackers — only to be shot and killed by an Israeli soldier who apparently suspected he was also an assailant.The shooting of Castleman, who in security camera footage is seen kneeling, raising his hands and flinging open his shirt to indicate he isn’t a threat, underscores what critics say is an epidemic of excessive force by Israeli soldiers, police and armed citizens against suspected Palestinian attackers.“He took all the necessary steps so that he could be properly identified,” Castleman’s father, Moshe, told Israeli Army Radio on Sunday, “and they kept shooting at him.”Castleman’s shooting mirrors previous incidents where Israeli security forces or civilians have opened fire on attackers who no longer appear to pose a threat, or on suspected assailants or unarmed civilians deemed to be threats.The incident comes as tensions have been inflamed by the war between Israel and Hamas, with Israelis on edge and bracing for further attacks. It also coincides with a drive by Israel's national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to ramp up the number of gun-toting civilians.Palestinians and human rights groups have long accused Israeli forces of using excessive force, killing attackers who no longer posed a threat and even harming innocent people mistaken for attackers and then skirting accountability.Early Thursday, as the entrance to Jerusalem was swelling with traffic, two Hamas militants exited their car at a bus stop and opened fire on waiting commuters, killing three. In security camera footage, Castleman is seen running from the other side of the busy highway, brandishing his gun and shooting at the attackers. Soldiers are also seen opening fire.Castleman, a 38-year-old lawyer who was on his way to work, is seen appearing to flee the gunshots. He then kneels, raises his arms and opens his shirt before he is shot.His family is demanding to know how the heroism of their son culminated in his killing.Israeli authorities are investigating the incident and police said initial findings showed one of the soldiers “mistakenly suspected” Castleman was an attacker. Castleman, a resident of a Jerusalem suburb, had previously worked in the Israeli security forces, according to his father, and used his own gun against the attackers. He was shot in the jaw, chin and stomach.The soldier, identified by Israeli media as reservist Aviad Frija, told Israeli Channel 14 TV that he was active among “hilltop youth"" — a term used to refer to radicalized Jewish teen squatters on hilltops in the occupied West Bank who have been known to attack Palestinians and their property.Frija was not asked about Castleman's shooting. But he boasted about killing the attackers, saying doing so was every soldier's goal.Hilltop youth are politically aligned with Ben-Gvir, a disciple of a racist rabbi, who as the minister in charge of police has been leading a drive to proliferate arms among civilians by loosening the criteria for acquiring a gun permit. Ben-Gvir said Thursday's attack proved his policies were needed.“Weapons save lives. We see this time after time. Everywhere there are arms, citizens, police, soldiers save lives,” he said at the scene, without referring to Castleman. Ben-Gvir has also pushed for a national guard force he says is meant to fill in gaps where police are spread thin. Critics say it would amount to his own personal militia.Asked about the shooting on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he supported Ben-Gvir's policy to increase access to weapons even if it meant civilians like Castleman could be killed.“The presence of armed civilians many times saved the day and prevented a bigger disaster,” he told reporters. “It could be that we will pay a price for it. That’s life.”Netanyahu rival-turned-wartime ally Benny Gantz called for an investigation into the proper use of guns and the regulations surrounding their use.“That's not ‘life,’ but a warning sign,"" he posted on X, formerly Twitter.After an uproar over his comments, Netanyahu reversed course on Sunday, calling Castleman's death a “terrible tragedy.”“He is an Israeli hero,” Netanyahu said. He promised a thorough investigation and said he had called Castleman's father to offer condolences.Thursday's incident had echoes of previous ones that have shed light on Israeli open fire rules. Most infamous was the 2016 shooting death by an Israeli soldier of a badly wounded Palestinian assailant as he lay on the ground.The shooting by Sgt. Elor Azaria, which came as Israel was battling a low-level wave of Palestinian attacks, divided the country. While Israel’s top generals pushed for the prosecution of a soldier they say violated the military’s code of ethics, large segments of the public, including politicians on Israel’s nationalist right, sided with Azaria. Even Netanyahu, in a nod to his nationalist base, gave only lukewarm support to his military.Similarly, in 2015, after a deadly Palestinian attack at a bus station in the southern city of Beersheba, an Eritrean man was shot and beaten to death by a mob after being mistaken for an assailant. Two men charged with the death were acquitted, with the court siding with their claim that they believed he was an attacker.Critics said Thursday's incident was especially severe because Castleman took what they said were clear steps to prove that he was not an attacker.“It was an execution,” wrote Shelly Yacimovich, a former leader of Israel's liberal Labor Party, on the Ynet news site. “Against the law, against open fire regulations, the sanctity of arms. Immoral. And all that would be true even if he was a terrorist.”Moshe Karadi, a former police chief, said he believed the background of the soldier who allegedly shot Castleman influenced his thought process. “The finger is lighter on the trigger there than in other places,” he said, referring to the West Bank, where settler violence has flared during the war.Karadi said Ben-Gvir's crusade to arm more civilians would lead to untrained and unqualified arms carriers. He said greater access to guns would spark increased violence against minorities and women and lead to more incidents like Thursday's killing of an innocent civilian.Diana Buttu, a Palestinian analyst, said the incident reflected a reality that Palestinians have long lived with. She said how Castleman died — arms raised, knees to the ground — didn't surprise her given the heightened tensions since the war, coupled with what Palestinians see as the systemic use of excessive force and a drive to have more Israelis carry arms.",6721,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israeli-raced-confront-palestinian-attackers-killed-israeli-soldier-105342423,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/ac5d198a-1ce0-4bba-a1ba-239ed8c48f21/wirestory_f5368c1dff72161c701cee488914756a_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,jaw meant offer entrance occupy kneel properly flare step prime code prevent minority human pay place nationalist reflect demand car personal traffic great nod analyst sanctity gap castleman former busy mistakenly jerusalem rule sunday azaria policy beaten comment save drive lukewarm commuter ynet uproar politically israeli family severe apparently scene harm innocent swell segment echo believe wave bus big promise culminate attacker identify boast sign city woman ethic pose charge skirt push deem rabbi light buttu threat wait give investigate write x footage fill longer reservist prove mistaken execution heighten shoot align fire systemic civilian liberal settler ally shed deadly stop access claim country yacimovich indicate minister gunshot moshe exit initial especially immoral bank group base refer mob battling death thin shelly flee allegedly security price arm open palestinian elor inflame large highway leader site prosecution influence medium raise tv number police fling underscore army work sgt gun carry reality weapon tension surprise israel tel knee militant soldier thursday public hand include crusade post proper law accord kill epidemic hilltop race opening jewish top father mirror wound general hamas benjamin west call youth unqualified investigation disciple beersheba frija presence eritrean formerly news resident lead told background guard chief lighter national ground term violate terrible reporter critic increase divide criterion heroism radicalize reverse finger week couple shirt day party side authority karadi violence military disaster life hero warn amount force citizen gunman acquire accuse shot chin aviv unarmed radio proliferate surround finding incident channel ramp live begin itamar active infamous course permit excessive coincides support untrained regulation run attack loosening gantz previously bracing time lay court lawyer acquit badly suspect benny long aviad show suburb assailant process spread trigger edge labor southern spark racist previous squatter camera netanyahu saturday brandishing station yuval politician clear carrier,-0.9943,0.3570897187918464,10.359031476997576,0.4547241118669689,0,2023-12-03

An update is expected soon from the United States Central Command (CENTCOM).PENTAGON CONFIRMS 74TH ATTACK ON US TROOPS IN MIDDLE EAST SINCE OCT. 17The USS Carney was in the southern Red Sea, just north of the Bab al-Mandab Strait, when it shot down at least two Houthi drones heading in its direction, a U.S. official told Fox News, adding that the action was taken in self-defense. The drones were launched from Houthi controlled areas of Yemen, the official claimed.The official said several commercial vessels came under fire from the Houthi's and at least one was hit.A White House official seemed to downplay the incident to Fox News, saying that the American destroyer specifically did not come under attack in the Red Sea. Apparently, several commercial ships in the area were fired upon, and the U.S. ship responded to their distress calls.The U.S. official further told Fox News there are no injuries or damage to the USS Carney. The official did not have the exact distance of how far away the drones were when the USS Carney shot them down but said the American destroyer ""did not let them come too close.""There are no injuries to any of the crew members on the commercial vessels, which represent multiple nations, meaning the crews are from one country, while the ships are owned by another country and flagged by another, according to the official.

Politico,"Israel ‘receptive’ to American warnings about civilian casualties, John Kirby says",2023-12-03 11:07:00,Kelly Garrity,"Top American officials have begun publicly offering stark warnings to Israel about the consequences of the rising civilian death toll in Gaza. Israel is listening, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday.“What I can tell you is that in our conversations with them they have said that they agree with our idea here that the approach they take matters, that the reduction of civilian casualties and, quite frankly, minimizing damage to civilian infrastructure is important to them, that they understand that,” Kirby said during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”On Saturday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin cautioned that Israel risks “strategic defeat” in Gaza if it doesn’t do more to protect civilians. While speaking to reporters at an annual climate conference, Vice President Kamala Harris was even more forceful.“As Israel defends itself, it matters how. The United States is unequivocal: International humanitarian law must be respected,” Harris said after her meetings at COP28, which is being held in the United Arab Emirates this year. “Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating.’’The fighting began on Oct. 7, when Hamas led a surprise attack on Israel’s southern border, killing 1,200 people. Israel has since launched a siege of Gaza, killing more than 15,000 and periodically choking the flow of food and fuel into the region while Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel.“We believe they have been receptive to our messages here in terms of trying to minimalize civilian casualties, and I can tell you we saw that when they went into north Gaza, they did that in a more precise way, a smaller way,” Kirby said during an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” pointing to the map that Israeli forces have published online that shows “evacuation zones” the IDF says are meant to help reduce casualties.Israel has also been dropping leaflets urging civilians to exit areas before attacks.“There’s not a whole lot of modern militaries that would do that. … to telegraph their punches in that way. So they are making an effort,” Kirby added.But one U.N. agency noted it is unclear where the roughly 2 million people living in Gaza are supposed to evacuate to.“Reportedly, the map is intended to facilitate orders to evacuate specific areas ahead of their targeting. The publication does not specify where people should evacuate to,” the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs pointed out in an article. “It is unclear how those residing in Gaza would access the map without electricity and amid recurrent telecommunications cuts.”The conflict has roiled the Biden administration, as President Joe Biden and other top officials try to balance the need to support the U.S.’s most vital ally in the Middle East with calls from the left to push for a ceasefire and greater protections for civilians in the besieged region.“If we want to defeat terrorists, we have to abide by international humanitarian law. That is just my fundamental belief,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) on Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Defenders of Israel said the criticism is misplaced. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that the United States would never accept the types of limitations that the United States is advocating.“No Republican is telling Israel to change their military tactics, because I don’t know how to change them,” he said on “State of the Union.” “I think the goal of destroying Hamas is important for Israel, really important for the Palestinians, and Hamas is making it impossible for Israel to fight without hurting innocent people.”But Republican Rep. Mike Turner, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, agreed Sunday that the U.S. is troubled by the rising death toll.“Broadly, as you’ve reported, the United States is very concerned” about the “extent that Israel is not doing enough to protect civilians,” the Ohio Republican told CBS’ Margaret Brennan during an interview on “Face the Nation.”",4089,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/03/israel-john-kirby-warnings-00129777,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/0eca1db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3744+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd2%2Ff3%2F449d55c64d20bfd2a681ad3cd96c%2Fisrael-palestinians-52767.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,middle pramila electricity reduce telecommunication national hamas john suffer hurt cnn council suppose destroy leaflet ally casualty target listen change meeting goal note kirby nbc extent held top consequence american secretary call push make spokesperson conversation official lead israel meet video approach punch law access defense fundamental impossible specify warning broadly lindsey arab force rise vice mike left small image coordination infrastructure criticism point publicly innocent week rocket urge cbs defender amid article siege million affair biden troubled drop office begin president misplace agree living administration abide besiege terrorist concerned idf zone intelligence flow lot reside intend civilian belief idea attack surprise reportedly agency jayapal understand brennan committee tactic telegraph defeat exit death frankly modern region graham conference palestinian nation defends scale evacuation accept state specific protect offering fuel annual reporter security limitation strategic margaret protection believe ahead receptive minimalize message fight harris gaza continue term year recurrent publish interview conflict humanitarian north israeli area international roughly report reduction unclear saturday map roil caution sunday online support emirate risk matter publication great kill border facilitate turner military stark precise evacuate show speak type southern toll ohio climate abc chair choke united launch effort unequivocal ceasefire house lloyd respect important told food periodically east order joe kamala vital minimize republican meant austin damage balance,-0.9445,0.3668378576669112,9.674138817480724,0.4319791666666666,0,2023-12-03

ABC,"Pentagon: US warship, multiple commercial ships have come under attack in the Red Sea",2023-12-03 10:58:00,JON GAMBRELL Associated Press,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Commercial ships came under attack Sunday by drones and missiles in the Red Sea and a U.S. warship there opened fire in self-defense as part of an hourslong assault claimed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, officials said.The attack potentially marked a major escalation in a series of maritime attacks in the Mideast linked to the Israel-Hamas war as multiple vessels found themselves in the crosshairs of a single Houthi assault for the first time in the conflict.“We’re aware of reports regarding attacks on the USS Carney and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and will provide information as it becomes available,” the Defense Department told The Associated Press.The Carney is an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer that’s already shot down multiple rockets the Houthis have fired toward Israel so far in the war. It wasn't damaged in the attack and no injuries were reported on board, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss early details of a military operation.The Carney responded after hearing from the Bahamas-flagged bulk carrier Unity Explorer that it was under attack by missile fire, the official said. The Carney shot down two drones during the attack, one in self-defense and another after checking on the Unity Explorer, the official said.Assessments were still being made on the Unity Explorer.The British military earlier said there had been a suspected drone attack and explosions in the Red Sea, without elaborating.The Defense Department did not identify where it believed the fire came from. However, Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed the attacks, saying the first vessel was hit by a missile and the second by a drone while in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden.Saree did not mention any U.S. warship being involved in the attack.“The Yemeni armed forces continue to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea (and Gulf of Aden) until the Israeli aggression against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip stops,” Saree said. “The Yemeni armed forces renew their warning to all Israeli ships or those associated with Israelis that they will become a legitimate target if they violate what is stated in this statement.”Saree also identified the first vessel as the Unity Explorer, which is owned by a British firm that includes Dan David Ungar, who lives in Israel, as one of its officers. The second was a Panamanian-flagged container ship called Number 9, which is linked to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. Managers for the two vessels could not be immediately reached for comment.Israeli media identified Ungar as being the son of Israeli shipping billionaire Abraham “Rami” Ungar.The Houthis have been launching a series of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, as well as launching drones and missiles targeting Israel amid the war.Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said the attack began about 10 a.m. in Sanaa, Yemen, and had gone on for as much as five hours.Global shipping had increasingly been targeted as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to become a wider regional conflict — even as a truce briefly halted fighting and Hamas exchanged hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. However, the collapse of the truce and the resumption of punishing Israeli airstrikes and its ground offensive there had raised the risk of the seaborne attacks resuming.Earlier in November, the Houthis seized a vehicle transport ship also linked to Israel in the Red Sea off Yemen. The rebels still hold the vessel near the port city of Hodeida. Missiles also landed near another U.S. warship last week after it assisted a vessel linked to Israel that had briefly been seized by gunmen.However, the Houthis had not directly targeted the Americans for some time, further raising the stakes in the growing maritime conflict. In 2016, the U.S. launched Tomahawk cruise missiles that destroyed three coastal radar sites in Houthi-controlled territory to retaliate for missiles being fired at U.S. Navy ships at the time.___",4119,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/pentagon-us-warship-multiple-commercial-ships-attack-red-105340787,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/ee2ea7ba-627b-4b6d-8782-dcf15e2af028/wirestory_716770f0a780160e9abed98d3c48fbde_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,radar escalation wider dubai navigate rebel drone prevent tomahawk mention brig cruise missile detail british aware container houthi held potentially sunday truce warship found transport carrier israeli airstrikes coastal briefly steadfast believe defense identify hostage city involve navy condition assault officer shipmanagement renew mideast offensive early seize brother yahya fire available official matter aggression stop launch american punish resumption part amid explorer fight arleigh regional anonymity department gulf marked open strait arm palestinian discus board territory bulk gaza site unity destroyed arab directly medium raise single abraham check bernhard number land prisoner yemen israel earlier hold halt threatens include vessel aden major risk conflict strip spoke hamas retaliate red call reach stake exchange legitimate manager november injury hodeida told intelligence saree continue sanaa ground violate houthis claimed destroyer spokesman yemeni week speak bab firm increasingly military life warn respond force collapse crosshairs shot ungar rocket united ramus associate immediately hourslong billionaire begin information explosion attack carney grow regard damage time hearing provide emirate vehicle suspect hit seaborne assist maritime multiple series link port commercial schulte make report target david shipping state ship,-0.99525,0.0,11.930666666666667,0.2311072396438249,0,2023-12-03

She was 79.Kinnock died Sunday at her London home some six years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, her family said.Kinnock went from being a schoolteacher to an outspoken politician to cabinet minister under former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and was known for her work to reduce poverty and starvation in Africa and other parts of the world.Tony Blair, the former prime minister, said she had been a huge support to her husband but was a leader herself and her passing would be mourned in many places around the globe.“She was a huge figure in progressive politics for decades: incredibly smart, brave, determined and resolute in standing up for what she believed was right,” Blair said. “Whether in fighting the cause of development, and the eradication of global poverty, social justice in Britain, equality for women or making the case for a European Union of weight and influence in the world, Glenys was passionate and persuasive.""Kinnock served as a member of the European Parliament from Wales for some 15 years before being made a baroness by Brown in 2009 so she could serve as his minister for Europe.During her time in Brussels, she was caught up in a scandal with scores of other European Parliament members for signing in each day to collect a daily 175-pound ($222) allowance and then departing.Born Glenys Elizabeth Parry on July 7, 1944, in England, she graduated from high school on the Welsh island of Anglesey and went to University College, Cardiff, where she met her future husband.They were married in 1967 and had two children, Stephen, a Labour Party member in the House of Commons, and Rachel.",1785,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/glenys-kinnock-former-uk-minister-european-parliament-member-105340688,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/34b52800-a1f2-4d21-9a4e-0ad3ea9dbc22/wirestory_3d7e323d3d2bd1a8e1a8660f25bc6282_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,influence outspoken member passing brussels prime work allowance disease place smart parry cabinet alzheimer persuasive britain stephen parliament gordon common stand british development high former child caught sunday eradication july reduce college schoolteacher husband wife rachel graduate family justice brown london married union case believe england world day determine scandal island party kinnock woman decade year house european africa university politics neil labour brave incredibly social baroness signing serve equality huge daily weight support figure school elizabeth glenys collect time minister part blair passionate fight global resolute mourn score diagnose anglesey home welsh poverty make progressive cardiff politician leader future starvation,0.9058,0.0,10.076646706586825,0.2941765873015873,0,2023-12-03
ABC,"Guinea-Bissau’s leader calls a shootout an attempted coup, heightening tensions in West Africa",2023-12-03 10:12:00,CHINEDU ASADU Associated Press and SAMBU ASSANA Associated Press,"BISSAU, Guinea Bissau -- BISSAU, Guinea Bissau (AP) — A shootout in Guinea-Bissau’s capital Friday was an attempted coup, President Umaro Sissoco Embalo said Sunday after a meeting with security forces, confirming fears over the latest threat to democracy in the increasingly volatile and coup-hit West Africa.“They attempted a coup and failed to materialize their objective,” Embalo said, after members of the National Guard command improperly released two ministers detained over alleged corruption, resulting in a shootout with the Presidential Palace Battalion.During a visit to the National Guard command in Bissau, Embalo said Victor Tchongo, the head of the National Guard, has been dismissed and “will pay dearly” for the attempt to depose the president.“You are all betrayed by your commander … (and) this is why we advise you to distance yourself from politicians and do your service to the nation,” he told officers.The attempted coup is the second in West and Central Africa in a week after last week's failed coup in Sierra Leone. It further raises tensions in the region where coups have surged with eight military takeovers since 2020, including in Niger and Gabon this year.West Africa's regional economic bloc of ECOWAS — to which Guinea-Bissau belongs — noted the incident with “deep concern” and expressed “full solidarity with the people and constitutional authority of Guinea-Bissau.”After returning from the United Nations’ COP28 climate summit on Saturday night, Embalo suggested to reporters that Tchongo of the National Guard was not acting alone.“Tchongo was ordered by someone,"" The Democrat, a local newspaper, quoted him as saying. ""Tchongo is not crazy about blowing up the Judiciary Police cells and removing the minister of finance and the secretary of state. This is an attempted coup d’état and there will be serious consequences for everyone involved.”The small nation of Guinea-Bissau has endured multiple coups since gaining independence from Portugal nearly five decades ago.However, unlike in other coups in West Africa which have been inspired by perceived bad governance, the shootout in Guinea-Bissau started as the members of the Presidential Palace Battalion tried to rearrest two government officials — Economy and Finance Minister Suleimane Seidi and Treasury Secretary António Monteiro.Both were being questioned over the use of government funds before the members of the National Guard secretly released them, local media reported.Guinea-Bissau’s semi-presidential system limits the president’s powers by allowing the majority party in the parliament to appoint the Cabinet. As a result, the National Guard — which is under the Ministry of Interior — is largely controlled by the opposition-dominated parliament.Tensions have also remained between Embalo and a coalition of opposition groups that won the majority in Guinea Bissau’s parliament in June, more than one year after the president dissolved the parliament.Embalo, a former army general, was declared the winner of a December 2019 runoff presidential election which his opponent contested. He survived a February 2022 coup attempt that he asserted had “to do with our fight against narco-trafficking” and he has since then cracked down on civic freedoms while government bodies have lost significant independence, according to analysts.___",3347,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/guinea-bissaus-leader-calls-shootout-attempted-coup-heightening-105340362,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8ff5b3d3-9077-4f4f-bfe9-6b5fbbb93da4/wirestory_35e7ce80b316b7f28790f6b1c8d8d9b7_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,tchongo runoff power local lose corruption medium advise raise member interior newspaper police result gabon army suggest coalition order body pay nation contest democrat tension attempt dissolve region declare secretly night cabinet economic detain service distance include improperly start parliament independence antónio endure former accord express appoint coup portugal climate system sunday concern dearly general freedom west constitutional seidi allege economy winner belongs limit état ministry central told guard volatile national guinea assert objective president reporter inspire majority full perceive leone capital fail week materialize government takeover betrayed crack party authority increasingly military decade commander shootout note finance treasury command force year secretary africa friday embalo quote sierra largely threat remove bissau question fund small survive united incident act surge ecowas blowing meeting head consequence crazy control judiciary official solidarity confirm umaro december opponent remain democracy dismiss significant return minister election cell governance fight battalion regional rearrest group june multiple late suleimane civic security unlike presidential visit fear depose february saturday bloc sissoco victor release politician opposition palace niger state summit deep,0.069,0.358530026889752,13.014006968641116,0.348915343915344,0,2023-12-03
CNN,Ukraine investigating if Russian troops killed surrendering soldiers,2023-12-03 09:36:00,Yulia Kesaieva,"Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating whether Russian troops killed two Ukrainian service members after the pair had surrendered.The probe, which is being overseen by the Ukraine prosecutor general’s office, was announced a day after video of the incident was shared by Ukrainian government on social media. The incident took place near an observation post outside the village of Stepove near Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, the office said in a statement.“The killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is classified as a serious international crime,” the statement read.The Ukrainian military said on Saturday that the footage showed the execution of two prisoners of war. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.Russia has been accused of carrying out a litany of crimes since it invaded Ukraine, though the Kremlin has denied wrongdoing.

Reuters,"North Korea begins spy satellite operations, KCNA says",2023-12-03 09:06:00,not specified,"SEOUL, Dec 3 (Reuters) - North Korea has begun reconnaissance satellite operations, state news agency KCNA said on Sunday, after the country launched its first military spy satellite last month in a move that drew new sanctions from the U.S. and its allies.The new satellite operations office at the Pyongyang General Control Centre of the National Aerospace Technology Administration (NATA), started to discharge its mission on Saturday and will report acquired information to the reconnaissance bureau at the army and other major units, KCNA said.North Korea says it successfully launched its first military spy satellite on Nov. 21, transmitting photos of the White House, the Pentagon, U.S. military bases and ""target regions"" in South Korea.The move raised regional tensions and sparked fresh sanctions from the U.S., Australia, Japan and South Korea. Pyongyang has not released any imagery from the satellite so far, leaving analysts and foreign governments to debate how capable the new satellite actually is.In a separate article carried by KCNA on Sunday, an unidentified North Korean military commentator said the South is blamed for the breakdown of their military confidence-building agreement, justifying its spy satellite launch as what other countries also do.The article also argued that South Korea's own, first military reconnaissance launch this month proved to be self-contradictory.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Chairman Kim Myung-soo on Saturday made a visit to frontline units near the border with the North to assess readiness posture amid heightened tensions, the JCS said on Sunday.",1620,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-begins-reconnaissance-satellite-operations-kcna-2023-12-02/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FB7KLW6XK5L27AUGUXZMOZTTBQ.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,transmit white commentator korean move satellite raise administration argue kcna army justify separate carry tension pyongyang region breakdown operation reuters mission agreement start imagery analyst south dec major jcs office sunday general discharge fresh chairman technology news staff border chief national japan leave photo frontline government reconnaissance month military aerospace joint house bureau acquire successfully posture australia ass unidentified sanction drew seoul unit prove heighten begin information blame control nata agency foreign launch korea country readiness article amid pentagon regional base spy debate centre spark capable visit saturday report make target north release state,0.51865,0.0,13.64161172161172,0.3559731934731934,0,2023-12-03
Politico,"US intelligence community was not aware of Hamas’ plan to attack Israel, Kirby confirms",2023-12-03 09:06:00,Kelly Garrity,"The U.S. intelligence community was not aware of Hamas’ plan to attack Israel, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sunday, after the New York Times reported last week that Israeli officials obtained the plans more than a year before the Oct. 7 attack occurred.“The intelligence community has indicated that they did not have access to this document,” Kirby told NBC’s Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press.” POLITICO reported Friday that there was no indication Israel had shared the blueprint for the attack with the United States.Officials told the Times that if the Israeli military had taken the roughly 40-page document more seriously, they could have prevented the attacks, which killed more than 1,200 Israelis and led Israel to launch a devastating invasion of Gaza that has reportedly killed more than 15,000. But according to the report, Israel’s leadership disregarded the warning signs, viewing the attack as something beyond Hamas’ capabilities.“Intelligence is a mosaic and sometimes you fashion things together and get a pretty good picture, and other times there’s pieces of the puzzle that are missing,” Kirby added, when asked if the U.S. should’ve been made aware of the attack plans.The U.S. has long held an intelligence-sharing relationship with Mossad, which has previously established a robust data-collection operation on Hamas in Gaza. But the failure to provide details of the plan has led some lawmakers in Congress to question U.S. reliance on Israel for intelligence on Hamas.On Sunday, Kirby declined to say whether the Oct. 7 attack represented a failure by Israel’s intelligence operations, saying there would be “a time and place” for Israel to further investigate what went wrong.“Prime Minister Netanyahu has already spoken pretty candidly about this calling it a failure on their part. They’ll take a look at this at the right time, they need to do that,” Kirby said, but for now “the focus has got to be on making sure that they can eliminate the truly genocidal threat” of Hamas.",2033,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/03/us-intelligence-israel-hamas-attack-00129774,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/9c88fe0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1160x773+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F1e%2F84%2Ff9d54b424cad8b0507e5605271f1%2F3-23-21-john-kirby-ap-773.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,national hamas question prime john candidly kristen robust council invasion lawmaker place disregard kirby nbc obtain view prevent piece held security share call make spokesperson official lead establish mosaic focus gaza miss israel meet year mossad access represent indicate pretty israeli add roughly report aware failure document spoken sunday investigate previously devastate plan week leadership netanyahu genocidal long detail kill minister york congress military politico threat sign warn fashion blueprint time provide united decline picture launch eliminate intelligence indication told attack community welker reportedly operation part reliance accord friday relationship puzzle,-0.85365,0.2951303492375799,10.665706666666663,0.4587637458327115,0,2023-12-03

Officials said Sunday that 11 people are still missing.Tons of mud, rocks and trees rolled down from a mountain late Friday triggered by torrential rain, reaching a river that burst its banks and tore through mountainside villages near the popular Lake Toba in North Sumatra province.Rescuers used excavators, dogs and sometimes their bare hands to shift the rubble in the worst-hit village as they searched for the dead and missing, said Sariman Sitorus, the spokesman of the local Search and Rescue Agency.They also deployed several divers equipped with sonar detection to detect possible victims swept into Lake Toba, Sitorus said.He said rescuers late Saturday pulled out a mud-caked body on the lakeside, about 500 meters (yards) from the devastated Senior Bakara Hotel.

ABC,The fatal stabbing of a German tourist by a suspected radical puts sharp focus on the Paris Olympics,2023-12-03 08:43:00,ELAINE GANLEY Associated Press,"PARIS -- A bloodstain by a bridge over the Seine river was the only remaining sign on Sunday of a fatal knife attack 12 hours earlier on a German tourist, allegedly carried out by a young man under watch for suspected Islamic radicalization after serving prison time for preparing a violent attack.The random attack near the Eiffel Tower on Saturday night has drawn special concern for the French capital less than a year before it hosts the Olympic Games, with the opening ceremony due to take place along the river in an unprecedented scenic start in the heart of Paris.In a sign of that concern, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne called a meeting for Sunday evening with key ministers and officials charged with security for a “total review” of measures in place and the handling of the “most dangerous individuals,” her office said.After killing the tourist, the attacker crossed the bridge to the city’s Right Bank and wounded two people with a hammer, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Saturday night. The suspect, who apparently cried “Allahu Akbar” (God is great), was then arrested.Video circulating on the internet showed police officers, weapons drawn, cornering a man dressed in black, his face covered and what appeared to be a knife in his right hand. They twice tasered the suspect before arresting him, Darmanin said.Questioned by police, the suspect expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, Darmanin said.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on X, formerly Twitter, that the news from Paris was “shocking.”“My thoughts are with the friends and family of the young German man,” she wrote. “Almost his entire life was before him. ... Hate and terror have no place in Europe.”Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, in a post on X, expressed condolences for the victim's family and friends and hope that Europe stands together against terrorism. “A heartfelt thought to the family members and loved ones of the victim,"" she wrote. “May Europe stay united against every form of terrorism.""The French interior minister said the suspect was born in 1997 in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, outside Paris. He had been convicted and jailed for four years, until 2020, for planning violence, was under psychiatric treatment, tracked for suspected Islamic radicalization and was on a special list for feared radicals.The French media widely reported that the man, who lived with his parents in the Essonne region, outside Paris, was of Iranian origin.The case was turned over to the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office.“This person was ready to kill others,” Darmanin told reporters, who along with other government members and President Emmanuel Macron praised police officers for their response.Well-known emergency doctor Patrick Pelloux, who was among the first at the scene, told BFM-TV there was blood everywhere. Pelloux said he was told by the victim's entourage that the suspect stopped them to ask for a cigarette, then plunged his knife into the victim. “He aimed at the head, then the back. He knew where to strike,” Pelloux said.The daily Le Parisien, in an in-depth report published Sunday, said the suspect had a history of contacts via social networks with two men notorious for the gruesome killing of a priest during Mass in 2016 in Saint-Etienne du Rouvray and the man who killed a police couple at their home in Yvelines, west of Paris, a month earlier.France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russia’s Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police.The attack brought into sharp focus authorities' concern for potential terrorist violence during the 2024 Games.Just days earlier, the Paris police chief had unveiled detailed plans for the Olympic Games' security in Paris, with zones where traffic will be restricted and people will be searched. The police chief, Laurent Nunez, said one of their concerns is that vehicles could be used as battering rams to plow through Olympic crowds.___",4290,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/fatal-stabbing-german-tourist-suspected-radical-puts-sharp-105339138,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/52b41322-2148-42dc-9fee-46f4468db856/wirestory_c8aaace7f5abc11190fad38d687c2b69_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,behead violent gerald nunez cross member interior giorgia dress prime rouvray brought mountain notably place eiffel born pelloux night traffic great originally terror start fatal stand stay circulate parent former express river form game black sunday concern student love hope terrorism laurent alert family parisien priest hate apparently caucasus scene chechen attacker government treatment sign bridge yvelines ingushetia search city charge plunge person officer arrest zone psychiatric write x knew measure social anguish meeting heighten serve mass tower french back official cover internet foreign stop dangerous allahu prison muslim minister publish special radicalization bank cry allegedly security palestinian home terrorist territory annalena olympic strike bloodstain watch due random italian widely detailed medium plan contact condolence police knife carry emmanuel weapon entire doctor akbar region earlier hand afghanistan review planning ready network post blood premier scenic restrict plow office kill heartfelt opening wound prosecutor corner stab hour west call russia twitter formerly friend news handle told sharp key chief cigarette patrick unprecedented meloni reporter president aim case borne claimed german convict radicalize capital couple day islamic authority unveiled month violence young praise life emergency focus year prepare darmanin northern france baerbock arras macron united notorious host victim live head tourist daily ram gruesome october tracked attack remain teacher time essonne entourage jail individual vehicle suspect list hammer elisabeth drawn show turn accomplice potential god batter iranian fear paris saturday report ceremony europe heart history total tasered,-0.9947,0.8391608391608391,10.746393861892589,0.40426267281106,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Kyiv says Russian forces shot surrendering Ukrainian soldiers,2023-12-03 08:27:00,FELIPE DANA Associated Press and JOANNA KOZLOWSKA Associated Press,"KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian officials on Sunday launched an investigation into allegations that Russian forces killed surrendering Ukrainian soldiers — a war crime if confirmed — after grainy footage on social media appeared to show two uniformed men being shot at close range after emerging from a dugout.The video shows the servicemen, one of them with his hands up, walking out at gunpoint and lying down on the ground before a group of Russian troops appears to open fire. It was not immediately possible to verify the video’s authenticity or the circumstances in which it was filmed, and it was unclear when the incident took place.The Ukrainian General Prosecutor’s office on Sunday launched a criminal investigation, hours after the Ukrainian military’s press office said in an online statement that the footage is genuine.“The video shows a group in Russian uniforms shooting, at point-blank range, two unarmed servicemen in the uniform of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were surrendering,” the prosecutor’s office said in a Telegram update on Sunday.The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. As of Sunday evening, there were no public statements from the Russian government or military on the video.Kyiv, its Western allies and international human rights organizations have repeatedly accused Moscow of breaching international humanitarian law since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin denies these allegations.The video first appeared Saturday on DeepState, a popular Ukrainian Telegram channel covering the war. The post claimed the footage came from the front lines near Avdiivka, a Ukrainian holdout in the country’s part-occupied east where there has been fierce fighting in recent weeks.The General Prosecutor’s Office on Sunday said that the alleged killing took place in the Pokrovsk district, which includes Avdiivka and surrounding areas.“It’s clear from the video that the Ukrainian servicemen are taking the necessary steps that show they are surrendering,” Ukraine’s human rights chief, Dmytro Lubinets, said hours after the footage emerged on Saturday.In a statement posted to Telegram, Lubinets described the incident as “yet another glaring example of Russia’s violations of international humanitarian law.”Oleksandr Shtupun, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military grouping that is fighting near Avdiivka, was cited by Ukrainian media as saying the video was “glaring confirmation” of Moscow’s disrespect for the laws of war.In March, footage of a man exclaiming “Glory to Ukraine” before being gunned down in a wooded area sparked national outcry in Ukraine, as senior officials alleged that he was an unarmed prisoner of war killed by Russian soldiers.Last summer, Kyiv and Moscow also traded blame for a shelling attack on a prison in occupied eastern Ukraine that killed dozens of Ukrainian POWs. Both sides claimed the assault on the facility in Olenivka was aimed at covering up atrocities, with Ukrainian officials charging captive soldiers had been tortured and executed there.The U.N.'s human rights chief in July rejected Moscow’s claim that a rocket strike had caused the blast.Also on Sunday, Ukraine’s energy ministry reported that close to 1,000 towns and villages suffered power outages that day, with hundreds of settlements in the west battered by wintry weather and others affected by ongoing fighting.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, late on Saturday assessed that military operations have slowed down all along the frontline in Ukraine due to poor weather, with mud bogging down tracked vehicles and making it hard for lighter equipment and infantry to advance.Even so, Shtupun, of Ukraine's Tavria military command that oversees the stretch of frontline near Avdiivka, said in a separate statement Sunday that Russian infantry attacks had intensified in the area over the past day. In a Telegram post, he insisted Ukrainian troops were “holding firm” in Avdiivka and another nearby town.In the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, at least two people died and seven more were wounded after Russian forces on Sunday shelled a high-rise apartment block and other civilian buildings, the head of the city's military administration said in a series of Telegram posts.One of the updates by Roman Mrochko featured a blurred photo of what he said was the body of a deceased civilian, apparently lying on a dirt road or in a yard outside the high-rise. The photo's authenticity could not be independently verified.Regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin separately reported on Sunday that Russian shelling that day damaged two of Kherson's hospitals. He did not immediately reference any casualties.Earlier in the day, a 78-year-old civilian died in a village northeast of Kherson after Russian shells slammed into his garage, according to a Telegram update by the regional Ukrainian military administration.——",4968,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/kyiv-russian-forces-shot-surrendering-ukrainian-soldiers-confirmed-105338584,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5a43dc4b-2b27-4102-85b7-84d3c3cdecf2/wirestory_951040c3c41926243fdd71427e54fba0_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,northeast power settlement repeatedly emerge occupy administration step bogging separate human online place wooded update yard hard mrochko building stretch authenticity crime hundred exclaim tank humanitarian sunday july village russian denies ukraine comment oleksandr avdiivka ministry tavria energy possible intensified ukrainian apparently reject eastern slow wintry kyiv walk defense telegram government holdout city charge command uniform assault institute summer dirt disrespect breaching senior spokesperson gov footage social unclear shoot confirmation blame fire civilian prokudin official roman recent front district confirm ally cover study atrocity launch separately weather claim country prison past fight suffer affected group regional film close troop arm open grainy oversees strike pokrovsk due facility glare medium decease prisoner gunpoint moscow olenivka gun body line hospital popular hold lie soldier public operation uniformed hand include circumstance post nearby slam western law assess accord captive office kill deepstate invasion described blur criminal outage wound surrender general prosecutor email hour west allege investigation outcry russia equipment ongoing request international chief lighter national ground kherson aim lubinets claimed fierce dmytro range reference press photo frontline day kremlin firm side military execute respond block poor force violation glory feature east shtupun accuse shot mud unarmed rocket surround trade apartment incident immediately channel serviceman insist head statement allegation dozen tracked attack independently infantry area damage video verify torture vehicle show late pow garage series batter shell southern march spark february road saturday make report organization town clear,-0.99735,0.2415458937198067,12.76552046783625,0.2542534722222222,0,2023-12-03

ABC,"After visiting Israel and Ramallah, the ICC prosecutor says he will intensify investigations",2023-12-03 07:36:00,MIKE CORDER Associated Press,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court rounded off a historic first visit to Israel and Ramallah by posting video and written messages on Sunday, saying that a probe by the court into possible crimes by Hamas militants and Israeli forces “is a priority for my office.”In a video message from Ramallah, where he met with top Palestinian leaders, Prosecutor Karim Khan said the investigation that was launched in 2021 is ""moving forward at pace, with rigor, with determination and with an insistence that we act not on emotion but on solid evidence.”There have been widespread claims of breaches of international law by Hamas and Israeli forces since war erupted after the deadly Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas and other militants that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in southern Israel. Around 240 people were taken hostage.The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said Saturday that the overall death toll in the strip since the start of the war had surpassed 15,200. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but it said 70% of the dead were women and children. It said more than 40,000 people had been wounded since the war began.Khan said in a written statement issued after his visit that he witnessed “scenes of calculated cruelty” at locations of the Oct. 7 attacks. During the visit, he spoke to family members of Israeli victims and called for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages taken by Hamas and other militants.“The attacks against innocent Israeli civilians on Oct. 7 represent some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, crimes which the ICC was established to address,” Khan said in his written statement, adding that he and his prosecutors are working “to hold those responsible to account.”In a statement released by the Forum for Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the families thanked Khan “for the extraordinary decision to come and stand by the families in the aftermath of the horrors perpetrated by Hamas in Israel on Oct. 7 and the continued detention of hostages. We expect him to work to bring Hamas terrorists to justice for crimes against humanity and genocide.”Khan said he is ready to engage with local prosecutors in line with the principle of complementarity — the ICC is a court of last resort set up to prosecute war crimes when local courts cannot or will not take action. Israel is not a member state of the court and does not recognize its jurisdiction.Khan also visited Palestinian officials in Ramallah, including President Mahmoud Abbas, and spoke to Palestinian victims. He said of the war in Gaza that fighting in “densely populated areas where fighters are alleged to be unlawfully embedded in the civilian population is inherently complex, but international humanitarian law must still apply and the Israeli military knows the law that must be applied.”He said that Israel “has trained lawyers who advise commanders and a robust system intended to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law. Credible allegations of crimes during the current conflict should be the subject of timely, independent examination and investigation.”In his video message, Khan also said that humanitarian aid must be allowed into Gaza.“In Gaza, it is not acceptable — there’s no justification — for doctors to perform operations without light, for children to be operated upon without anesthetics,"" he said. ""Imagine the pain of operations on children, on anybody, on any of us, without anesthetics. I also emphasized that Hamas must not divert any aid that’s given.”Khan also expressed “profound concern” at what he called “the significant increase in incidents of attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank.“I emphasize, settler violence is unacceptable,"" he said in his video. ""It’s something we are investigating. We have been investigating and we are accelerating investigations. No Israeli settler armed with an ideology and a gun can think it’s open season on Palestinians.”Khan said he would seek to work with “all actors” in the conflict to “ensure that when action is taken by my office it is done on the basis of objective, verifiable evidence which can stand scrutiny in the courtroom and ensure that when we do proceed we have a realistic prospect of conviction.”___",4384,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/international-court-prosecutor-intensify-investigations-palestinian-territories-105338386,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b42b6915-9191-4aac-a791-0f246a64b926/wirestory_e4077faca4a4e94c7b2c1550ce78cf57_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,immediate credible local advise member widespread icc humanity mahmoud start priority forward realistic stand crime basis express witness differentiate humanitarian sunday concern operate probe timely set hague netherlands extraordinary divert ministry erupt possible israeli family khan justice ramallah profound verifiable scene innocent solid robust health populate hostage courtroom complementarity woman perpetrate detention toll round dead ensure conscience historic light justification perform investigate write imagine pain act ideology civilian official settler deadly forum acceptable launch significant claim principle surpass independent fight examination message death insistence arm open palestinian combatant recognize terrorist aid issue release determination add leader gaza expect inherently move fighter represent compliance work population unconditional gun line responsible doctor cruelty israel apply hold militant operation include ready post law complex child action office conflict kill train strip spoke criminal top shock wound system proceed prosecutor hamas west subject call actor allege investigation emphasize international address chief breach resort objective president horror karim evidence increase location unacceptable intend unlawfully embed violence military commander establish bring force prospect seek current thanked incident victim statement abbas engage anesthetic allegation attack scrutiny prosecute area decision video densely court lawyer continued season pace calculate aftermath southern rigor visit saturday emotion miss accelerate state,-0.9922,0.2052919708029196,10.7594,0.3318518518518518,0,2023-12-03
NPR,Philippine president says 'foreign terrorists' behind bomb that killed 4 during mass,2023-12-03 07:35:00,The Associated Press,"MANILA, Philippines â€” The Philippine president blamed ""foreign terrorists"" for a bomb blast that killed four people Sunday, wounded dozens of other Catholic worshippers in the south and sparked a security alarm, including in the capital, Manila, where state forces were put on alert. The suspected bomb, which the police said was made from a mortar round, went off and hit students and teachers who attended a Mass in a gymnasium at Mindanao State University in southern Marawi city, Taha Mandangan, the security chief of the state-run campus, told The Associated Press by telephone. Dozens of students and teachers dashed out of the gym and the wounded were taken to hospitals. Regional military commander Maj. Gen. Gabriel Viray III said four people were killed by the explosion, including three women, and 50 others were brought to two hospitals for treatment. Six of the wounded were fighting for their lives in a hospital, said Gov. Mamintal Adiong Jr. of the Islamic province of Lanao del Sur, which has Marawi as its capital. ""I condemn in the strongest possible terms the senseless and most heinous acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists upon the Mindanao State University,"" President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in a statement. ""Extremists who wield violence against the innocent will always be regarded as enemies to our society."" Marcos did not explain why he immediately blamed foreign militants for the high-profile bombing. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. later told a news conference without elaborating there was a strong indication of a ""foreign element"" in the bombing. Military chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said the bomb attack could be retaliation by Muslim militants for a series of battle setbacks. ""We are looking at possible angles,"" Brawner said. ""It could be a retaliatory attack,"" He cited the killing of 11 suspected Islamic militants in a military offensive backed by airstrikes and artillery fires on Friday near Datu Hoffer town in southern Maguindanao province. Regional police director Brig. Gen. Allan Nobleza said the slain militants belonged to Dawlah Islamiyah, an armed group that had aligned itself with the Islamic State group and still has a presence in Lanao del Sur province. Mosque-studded Marawi city came under attack from foreign and local Islamic militants who had associated themselves with the Islamic State group in 2017. The five-month siege left more than 1,100 dead, mostly militants, before it was quelled by Philippine forces backed by airstrikes and surveillance planes deployed by the United States and Australia. Army troops and police cordoned off the university shortly after the bombing and began an investigation, checking security cameras for any indication of who may have been responsible for the attack. Security checkpoints were set up around the city. Police Lt. Gen. Emmanuel Peralta told reporters that military and police bomb experts found fragments of a 60mm mortar round in the scene of the attack. Such explosives fashioned from mortar rounds had been used in past attacks by Islamic militants in the country's south. The deadly blast set off a security alarm beyond Marawi city as the Christmas season ushered in a period of travel, shopping sprees and traffic jams across the country. Police and other state forces were put under ""heightened alert"" in metropolitan Manila, security officials said. The Philippine coast guard said it ordered all its personnel to intensify intelligence gathering, stricter inspections of passenger ferries and the deployment of bomb-sniffing dogs and sea marshals. ""Amid this barbaric act, best public service must prevail,"" coast guard chief Admiral Ronnie Gavan said. The southern Philippines is the homeland of minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation and the scene of decades-old separatist rebellions. The largest armed insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, signed a 2014 peace deal with the government, considerably easing decades of fighting. But a number of smaller armed groups rejected the peace pact and press on with bombings and other attacks while evading government offensives.",4151,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/03/1216833307/philippine-president-says-foreign-terrorists-behind-bomb-that-killed-4-during-ma,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,checkpoint extremist element admiral mortar traffic large explosive student south gym number alarm past arm liberation woman spree act statement public considerably director foreign predominantly explain put alert secretary hit back front make islamic regional heighten official gov staff gilberto belong islamiyah service worshipper dozen brought fragment cordoned blame teacher defense elaborate adiong fire force country left homeland ushered treatment retaliation small ease violence army evade series innocent militant life set mass deadly amid jam siege gabriel metropolitan moro troop possible government presence catholic begin president season bombing align investigation fashion condemn mindanao heinous datu terrorist news gymnasium hospital slain intelligence stricter surveillance personnel attack setback explosion blast roman found expert passenger philippine gathering deployed bomb hoffer retaliatory spark responsible separatist pact minority peralta allan reject conference wield ferry nation round local province mamintal state muslim city lanao associate artillery shortly commander peace inspection enemy brig group ferdinand suspect coast ronnie reporter dash airstrikes intensify viray security rebellion chief nobleza society scene insurgent strong fight offensive term marcos police iii prevail angle marawi christmas brawner shopping barbaric deal attend press australia emmanuel sunday immediately travel mandangan quell guard battle kill deployment town manila military decade check wound plane telephone sign southern teodoro dawlah taha senseless perpetrate gavan united maguindanao university indication include told campus marshal order camera dead romeo friday period capital regard,-0.9429,0.505902192242833,11.451923076923077,0.2904761904761904,0,2023-12-03

""I’m down to my last bit of water and having to ration it.

ABC,Pope says he's doing better but skips his window appearance facing St. Peter's Square,2023-12-03 07:17:00,FRANCES D'EMILIO Associated Press,"VATICAN CITY -- For a second Sunday, an ailing Pope Francis skipped his popular window appearance to the public in St. Peter’s Square, but in televised remarks said he’s doing better even though his voice wouldn't let him read all his comments aloud.As he did a week earlier, Francis delivered very brief remarks from the chapel of the Vatican hotel where he lives and where he is recovering from what he has said is infectious bronchitis. Thousands of people in the square followed his words from giant screens set up outdoors.Francis, whose 87th birthday is later this month, also said he is following from afar the workings of the U.N. climate conference in Dubai. The pontiff was due to go to the COP28 conference on Friday to address the gathering.During his first chapel appearance on Nov. 26, he insisted he would make the trip despite his illness. He instead canceled it following his doctors’ orders and stayed at the Vatican, where he has received antibiotics intravenously.“Dear brothers and sisters, good day. Also today, I won't be able to read everything. I'm getting better, but the voice still isn't” enough to read everything, Francis said. He then passed the microphone to a priest who read prepared remarks, including about the end of the truce in the Israeli-Hamas war.“It's painful that the truce has been broken,'' Francis said in the remarks read by the priest. ”That means death, destruction and misery,'' the pontiff said. He called for the release of the remaining hostages who were seized from Israel in the Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, and lamented the lack of basic necessities of life in Gaza after Israel launched its war against Hamas.On Thursday, Francis told an audience of health care workers that he was advised against making the Dec. 1-3 trip to the United Arab Emirates because ""it’s very hot there, and you go from heat to air conditioning,” Of his current illness, Francis told that audience: “Thank God it wasn’t pneumonia. It’s a very acute, infectious bronchitis.”Previously the Vatican had said Francis was suffering from a lung inflammation and the flu. Francis had a previous case of acute bronchitis in the spring, when he was hospitalized for three days so he could receive intravenous antibiotics.Francis said that “even from a distance, I am following with great attention the work of COP28 in Dubai. I am close” to the conference. He said he was renewing his appeal so that “climate change is answered by concrete political change.""",2477,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/pope-francis-skips-window-appearance-facing-st-peters-105338100,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/6406e7a2-b761-4bd3-bad6-8a563a888f54/wirestory_104cfaa7b185bece08a784910889aaf4_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,gaza due chapel dubai pass arab advise concrete instead word conditioning work lament order hospitalize doctor trip popular israel televise earlier thursday public spring francis include distance great hot ail climate sunday working sister hamas truce dear set call vatican attention answer intravenous comment skip lack address told broken priest appeal case misery prepared heat health week cancel day thousand giant hostage city month air life destruction read change birthday friday illness remark recover renew audience current lung united pope seize brother follow today insist painful afar window despite remain attack launch worker bronchitis previously voice pneumonia emirate antibiotic microphone necessity suffer conference stayed death god close appearance acute inflammation political pontiff basic infectious previous make square screen release deliver flu receive,-0.56145,0.0,8.392181069958848,0.442816091954023,0,2023-12-03
Politico,Russia Is Fighting More Than One War. I Went to Check on the ‘Other’ One.,2023-12-03 07:00:00,Tim Mak,"GAZIANTEP, Turkey — Mahmoud Amed Nasser arrived in Turkey a month ago. It’s safe here, but he still can’t stop listening for the sound of planes. Russian planes.Nasser, 48, traveled from the rebel-held city of Idlib, Syria, to Turkey with his young grandson, who needs medical treatment for a congenital heart defect. In Syria, planes signal danger. Just the day before, he told me, his grandson was utterly terrified by the sounds of a commercial airliner.“All our children know the sounds,” Nasser said. Even though there was no danger there in Turkey, his grandson grabbed him and told him, “Granddad, there’s a warplane in the sky!”In Syria, he added, there is little they can do when Russian warplanes come, except hide and hope for the best. Oh, and “open your mouth,” he said with a grim laugh. Opening their mouths helps them not get injured or killed by the pressure waves from the blast, he explained.“We and the Ukrainians have the same enemy, have the same killer,” Nasser said.In Ukraine, Russian bombing is detected by radar and warnings sent over digital apps. Hundreds of foreign journalists relay the events. In Syria, the death and destruction comes without much notice — or attention from the outside world.The Russian military has continued to fight and commit atrocities in Syria for eight years, with no sign of slowing. It’s a signal to Ukraine of just how long Russia is willing to conduct indiscriminate attacks, and a warning that Russia is able to drag out conflicts over long periods of time.The war in Syria is also a sad reminder that public attention in the West fades, and that the Syrian civil war — once a central point in the U.S. foreign policy discussions — continues even after the vast majority of attention has shifted to other conflicts.More than 12 years ago, it was war in this part of the world that riveted the world’s attention. As part of the broader Arab Spring, Syrians marched for democratic rights in 2011. For a time they won Western attention and sympathy, as dictator Bashar Assad’s brutal crackdown was revealed through photographs and videos of torture, killings and the use of chemical weapons. But over the years, the war ground to a stalemate, and the world’s attention drifted away.I’m guilty of that, myself. As a reporter, I covered the Syrian civil war intimately in its early years. But time went on, and other topics came up. I’ve never forgotten about it, exactly, but it sort of shifted to the side.For almost two years now I’ve been reporting in Ukraine, covering Russia’s full-scale invasion and its efforts to seize more Ukrainian territory. I often thought about what was happening to Russia’s other war — the war that people were paying far less attention to, the one that it was fighting in support of Assad, a war of attrition where Russia aimed to outlast its enemies.So on a trip to Turkey, I decided to make a trip to the Syrian border to find out.All wars fade, eventually. But only some wars have the misfortune of fading in the public consciousness while the killing continues largely unabated, ignored by nearly all except for victims and aggressors.Here’s what’s being ignored in Syria: An average of 84 civilians have been killed per day over the past decade, according to a U.N. estimate. This totals more than 306,000 deaths since 2011, when the Assad regime brutally cracked down on pro-democratic demonstrations and triggered the civil war.The U.N. has said that these numbers represent a minimum estimate and that the likely number killed is much higher. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based NGO, has made an estimate of over 600,000 killed, including civilians and non-civilians. Russia has been assisting Assad since 2015, conducting air and ground operations against the opposition forces.The war in Ukraine, also a conflict driven by Russian action, has made things even worse for Syrian civilians. Goran Ahmad, chair of the board at the humanitarian group Bahar, said it has added to skyrocketing inflation. He pointed out that flour in rebel-controlled parts of Syria now costs double what it did before Russia invaded Ukraine, which supplies much of the world with grain.“The Ukraine war affected the whole world. And specifically Syria, where the U.N. agencies, U.S. aid and all the funds start to focus more on Ukraine,” Ahmad told me from his office in Gaziantep. “And this reduced the support to Syria and made Syria low-profile … [people are] slowly, slowly forgetting about Syria.”Meanwhile, apparently taking advantage of the world’s attention being focused on Ukraine and Gaza, the Assad regime and Russia have stepped up their attacks in recent months. From January to July, there were a total of 388 bombardments. The second half of the year, which is not yet complete, has already seen 415, according to the Syrian Emergency Task Force, an American NGO that tallies attacks in Syria.Nasser and his grandson have been staying for about three weeks at the House of Healing, a charitable initiative in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep, just about an hour from the Syrian border.They are residing for the time being in a nondescript multistory building with dimly lit stairwells and brightly lit kitchens — the House of Healing hosts refugees who are able to cross into Turkey to seek medical care. When I arrived, I took off my shoes outside, then sat on the carpeted floor to talk to the people staying there.The Syrians at this home — there were a few dozen waiting for help — come from places whose names might spur a brief moment of recognition from when they were regularly and intensely covered in the Western press a decade ago. Places like Aleppo, where 147 bodies were found in the river in 2013, likely executed in Assad regime-controlled areas. And Ghouta, where the Assad regime used a nerve agent, killing 1,429 people and testing President Barack Obama’s “red line” for American military intervention (the U.S. ultimately would not intervene).Many of those places have become a landscape of destroyed buildings and awful memories. But talk to anyone who works or lives in Syria, and you’ll find them stressing the need to remember.“The massacre in Syria is ongoing,” Ahmad reminds me.The world’s forgetting about the Syrian conflict is no mere inconvenience for Syrians fighting to uproot the Assad regime. As time has passed, and the conflict has grown more intractable, there is less talk about support for the opposition and more and more discussion about the normalization of relations between Assad’s government and other regional players.The UAE began restoring diplomatic relations with the Assad regime in 2018. This year, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have pressed regional countries to recognize his government. And in May, Assad was welcomed back to a summit of the Arab League for the first time since 2011, in what Al Jazeera described as a “warm reception” — this despite an overwhelming amount of evidence that he and his regime have committed war crimes. Assad used the opportunity to deliver a speech stressing that other countries should not meddle in the “internal affairs” of Arab states.Concerned about these developments, opponents of the Assad regime are seeking to codify an anti-normalization stance into U.S. law.“We cannot condone normalization with the Assad regime,” said Veronica Zanetta Brandoni, the director of advocacy at the Syrian Emergency Task Force. “We have to stand firmly with the people of Syria who are asking for democracy, freedom, human rights and all the things that the U.S. counts as its own core values.”To this end, the organization supports passage of the Assad Regime Anti-Normalization Act, which has bipartisan backing in both the House and Senate. In the House, it has already gathered 48 co-sponsors.The new legislation would prohibit the United States from normalizing relations with the Assad regime, and to actively oppose recognition of his government by other countries. It would also expand sanctions against the Assad government, and clarify sanctions in the Caesar Act, named after the pseudonym of an individual who cataloged and photographed evidence of the torture and murder of some 11,000 Assad regime detainees.The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the bill by voice vote in May, and its advocates are pushing for it to be passed in the House of Representatives under a suspension of normal rules, given the broad support it has already received.“Backed by war criminal [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and the terrorist Mullahs in Tehran, over half a million people in Syria have been slaughtered by this criminal regime, and over half the Syrian population has been displaced,” said Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), the lead sponsor of the bill, in a statement. “The Assad regime is illegitimate and poses a threat to peace and prosperity in the region.”The United States is just one arena where the fate of Syria and Syrians is being debated. Turkey, once so hospitable toward Syrian refugees, has over the years begun to spurn them. The Syrians I spoke to said that the welcoming attitude they got when the civil war began has since faded; one told me that he was berated recently on the street in Gaziantep by a stranger for speaking Arabic instead of Turkish.In fact, a September 2018 poll found that 83 percent of Turks viewed Syrian refugees negatively. A majority of those upset with Syrian refugees cited economic issues like rising unemployment, lower wages and Syrian nonpayment of taxes.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who welcomed Syrian refugees over a decade ago as “our brothers,” decided this year during his reelection campaign to promise the repatriation of a million Syrians back to Syria. His political opposition ran on even harsher measures.But not everyone has moved on, or forgotten the plight of suffering Syrian civilians. Just this past year, Mohammed Noor Yaserji, himself a Syrian refugee, formed a new home for orphans — 39 of them and counting. He called it “A Noor Home” — “noor” meaning light.The new orphanage is set up in Kilis, a Turkish border town just a stone’s throw from Syria, where olive and pistachio trees grow plentifully. Kilis is one of many Turkish areas that have been transformed by the Syrian civil war and an influx of civilians seeking safety from violence. Kilis has the unique distinction of being a rare place where there are more Syrian refugees than Turkish residents.Yaserji’s orphanage is a happy place, where children can learn in classrooms and better their lives. With a background in music, Yaserji has made it central to their education. To welcome me to the orphanage, they sang songs about friendship, and one even sang a moving song about his deceased mother.“I’ve seen with my own eyes some of these kids, when they were just out after … losing their parents, drinking rainwater that’s accumulated on the ground, they have no shelter at all,” said Yaserji. “All of them lost their parents in the war. A lot of them … in the bombardment itself. The same strike that made them lose their homes, and where we got them from under the rubble, [is where they] lost their parents.”But Syrian children are like children everywhere else when they’re given a little opportunity and a chance to grow up in peace. Members of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, which works to alleviate civilian suffering and ensure accountability for war crimes, arrived at the orphanage recently bearing gifts.I watched as the boys and girls squealed with glee and jockeyed for position to receive digital watches, soccer balls and plastic dump trucks. And then they went right to work, playing excitedly with their new gadgets and toys as kids their age might anywhere else in the world, regardless of what country they came from, or what race they happened to be.On the streets of Kilis, outside the orphanage, Syrian children seemed to rule the streets in the middle of day. Many are without parents. Some of them have intense emotional reactions to the war, especially if they were injured in the attacks, said Nour al-Hamouri. She was 14 when a Russian airstrike landed nearby, breaking her pelvis and nearly destroying her leg. She’s now 21 and studying to become a psychotherapist.“I know some girls that have been disabled because of injuries, and they don’t want to live anymore,” she said, with her crutches nearby. “When a bombardment happens, it’s not just about a city, it’s about changing people’s lives.”Yaserji said he understands why attention and empathy toward Syrian refugees have dropped with the passage of time, whether in Turkey or in the United States. The same phenomenon is already happening with the West’s interest in Ukraine, and for similar reasons.“People start worrying about their economic situation. They lose interest over time ... people tend to forget, they always find something more important that comes up,” he told me.But he urged people to fight the instinct to move on, to forget, or to plunge into apathy. The first reason was a more practical one: Caring increases international cooperation, which reduces local suffering — whether in Ukraine, or in Syria.But his second, more personal reason, had him evoking the language of family. It felt like a hard-earned lesson from someone who is dedicating his life to taking care of orphans.“People should care, because they’re human beings,” Yaserji said. “Out of humanity. We’re all brothers and sisters.”",13452,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/12/03/russia-syria-war-turkey-00128920,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/7f9bfd6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5142x3431+0+0/resize/1290x861!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F31%2F87%2Fbf61a7e74c5989186b9c40381e87%2Fmag-mak-letterfromturkey-lead.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,nerve listen radar overwhelm stranger pass noor repatriation ngo disabled digital reduces human pay illegitimate recently plane minimum ball instinct economic discussion plentifully stairwell enemy chair personal mahmoud congenital building start test misfortune kilis peace stand boy hundred nonpayment syria blast river form humanitarian condone period rule sister hope policy attention reduce found notice dimly distinction central view moment gaziantep ukrainian granddad family photograph brutally apparently injured wave rivet wage heal government treatment driven bearing flour city sad reporting decade pose plunge ensure estimate inconvenience barack shoe bombing erdoğan fund seize saudi brother unique decide uae cooperation recognition welcome goran back normalize gadget drop low brandoni stalemate foreign slowly atrocity syrian jazeera killing kitchen stone past chance part fight especially plastic suffer tree pseudonym observatory clarify oppose open ghouta yaserji fade campaign olive drinking issue diplomatic add strike summit gaza watch destroyed arab consciousness meaning negatively move find number intensely decease reminder regime throw work half pelvis body attrition trip skyrocket orphanage intense utterly intervene include arena advocate cost commit girl massacre civil nearby western average high development play child speech effort spur action conflict airstrike race described january tayyip hour red bill call worry slaughter sort ongoing dictator injury border lead grim background nondescript continue prosperity ground reside reporter president majority floor empathy arabia lot press crack week ultimately month military air execute charitable warn destruction focus emergency brightly apathy shelter topic journalist victim live ahmad support suspension reception attack refugee middle area soccer inflation broader video internal voice time advantage continued reelection initiative alleviate important long mouth unemployment assist catalog squeal ran toy terrify plight urge trigger music southern march apps jordan actively total transform state firmly idlib local agent friendship cross member classroom double tally accumulate recep nasser instead step dedicate pressure hospitable poll tend democratic place grandson carpet defect safe humanity memory rare spring forgotten restore pistachio uproot stance leg shift truck sponsor stay conduct crime parent medical legislation language learn happen july freedom russian september expand set ukraine reveal zanetta forget interest prohibit codify intimately accountability slow amed excitedly promise kid sign landscape chemical phenomenon push happy warm threat wait give anymore ago sanction early arrive act felt senate signal mullah fading specifically civilian danger recent receive cover supply guilty stop opponent study evoke american attitude country jockeyed percent intractable count lesson aleppo affected group regional vladimir fate grown vote death indiscriminate crackdown street political home detect recognize emotional aid board terrorist territory reminds wilson practical rubble rainwater broad bashar lose advocacy land represent normalization population gather weapon grabbed line representative turk killer similar reason meddle joe public harsher operation orphan talk arabic crutch task fact counting drift complete accord laugh passage sound office kill eye invasion spoke opening understands affair sympathy criminal million sky veronica west normal break warning bahar russia sat murder brutal relation director upset told international core turkey eventually situation lit aim warplane song evidence position increase world point day age speak vast putin mohammed violence young education life event year change house amount force obama influx assad dump invade safety spurn largely seek unabated regularly bombardment opportunity united ignore host awful demonstration begin statement intervention despite agency tehran dozen democracy caesar grow multistory torture individual displace league stress debate outlast rise bipartisan hide nour commercial relay travel drag backing reaction make organization town opposition berate destroy heart deliver glee committee turkish,-0.9986,0.3568242640499554,8.99374613003096,0.3763290446326159,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,"How U.S. institutions took an African teen’s life, then lost his remains",2023-12-03 07:00:00,not specified,"His name was Sturmann Yanghis. He was a 17-year-old South African brought by ship to the United States in 1860 with four other young men billed in the press as “wild African savages” who had “never before been brought into contact with civilization.” Each represented a different Indigenous group.“A Hottentot, a Kaffir, a Bushman, a Zooloo and a Fingo,” proclaimed an advertisement by P.T. Barnum's American Museum. “These interesting barbarians appear in their original grotesque costumes made of the skins of wild animals and birds.”For seven months, the young men were paraded by Barnum and the Boston Aquarial and Zoological Gardens on stages in Boston and New York, alternately applauded by audiences and ridiculed by showmen and reporters. At a time when racial science, premised on the belief that people of color were inferior to White people, was a hot topic at many of the nation’s universities, the troupe’s performances drew large audiences eager to pay the 25 cents required to view the dark-skinned human specimens wearing porcupine quills.The show, however, was largely a lie. The five men were not wild savages but laborers, most of them from the bustling city of Port Elizabeth, according to one South African newspaper. They were not named things like Macuolo and Quagqua but rather John and George. And long before their year-long contract expired, Sturmann — referred to as a “Hottentot,” a pejorative term for the Khoekhoe people — had had enough. One afternoon, while his fellow performers were elsewhere, the teenager hanged himself.“Although of a melancholy turn, his companions had no fears that he would commit suicide,” the Daily Exchange reported. “Their grief was inexpressibly great on learning of the sad event.”The sadness didn’t end there. What followed was an extraordinary saga of abuse and exploitation of the teenager’s remains, nearly unparalleled in anthropological annals.Harvard University revealed in a report last year on its engagement with slavery that Sturmann’s corpse was donated to a Harvard anatomy professor, who dissected his body and compared it to those of a gorilla, a chimpanzee and two Europeans. Multiple plaster casts were made of his head, one of which was displayed in a Harvard museum; they’re still in Harvard’s collections. His remains were then transferred to the Boston Society of Natural History, but somewhere along the way his brain was either lost or destroyed, according to conflicting BSNH records. Today, neither Harvard nor the BSNH knows where the teenager’s skeleton is.But his story continues. Unlike the vast majority of the thousands of human remains that have been collected by the nation’s universities, which have virtually no surviving records, Sturmann’s fate is chronicled in multiple documents, including one academic paper that suggests that he did not kill himself and might even have been murdered.Christopher Willoughby, a historian at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, who has written that Sturmann “epitomizes a case of a person whom White scientists tried to fashion into an image of Black inferiority,” is working to track down the teenager’s skeleton.“If Harvard lost his remains due to bureaucratic disinterest many years ago, that is not good,” Willoughby said. “But it is worth looking for them. My goal is to find his remains and return them to South Africa.”White imperialism defined Sturmann’s life from the moment of his birth. His name was of Dutch origin, reflecting South Africa’s history of colonial domination. (The Union of South Africa wouldn’t be established until 1910, but the territory was widely known as South Africa.) He’s believed to have been Khoekhoe, but he reportedly never learned his people’s native language; instead, he spoke English and Dutch. He was apparently born in the region of Little Namaqualand, but as a young man he migrated to Port Natal (now called Durban), which was controlled by the British.Much of his youth was spent either evading White men or working for them.Sturmann was working in Port Natal in the summer of 1860, leading hunting exhibitions for White men, when the captain of an American ship asked him if he “would like to go over the sea to America, and have plenty of fine clothes and food, and earn plenty of money, to bring back to his own country,” according to a pamphlet titled “The Aborigines of South Africa,” which provided Boston audiences with brief biographies of the five “wild savages.” And so it was that the teenager “made a bargain with the white man and came over in a big ship.”The pamphlet described Sturmann as “quite an Adonis of his race.” But it was less than complimentary about other things.“No portion of this race has advanced beyond the rudest stage of the pastoral state of society,” it stated, adding, “So feeble is their intellect … it is almost impossible to instill fresh ideas into their minds.”The troupe of South Africans that debuted in October 1860 at the new Boston Aquarial and Zoological Gardens were hardly the first human or “ethnological” exhibitions to appear in the United States. Since the early 1800s, people had been put on display in their so-called primitive state, often to emphasize their cultural difference or supposed inferiority. One of the most famous of them was a woman named Sara Baartman, who was dubbed the “Hottentot Venus” and was displayed in Europe at times with an animal collar around her neck. After she died in 1815, her body was dissected and put on display in a French museum.The exhibit of the South African men in Boston began with a cacophony of animal sounds made by the “savages” while out of sight. The troupe then leaped onto the stage, barely clad in skins and feathers and clutching spears and clubs, and proceeded to perform several native songs and dances.At the end of the year, the troupe traveled to New York to appear at Barnum’s American Museum, alongside such spectacles as “two living Aztec children,” “two albino girls” and “thirty monster snakes,” according to an ad in the New York World.Onstage, the group rarely broke character. “The South African actors obscured their individuality and their agency, both as actors and laborers behind their performance as unchanging specimens of the savage races,” wrote Matthew Smith Miller in a 2011 Harvard thesis about the exhibition.After seven months of performing, Sturmann took his life. “He was found suspended by the neck in a small room in the rear of the lower part of the [Aquarial] building,” the Albany Evening Journal reported. “Before committing the act … he placed his effects in another part of the building in accordance, as is said, with a custom in his native land.”An autopsy was performed on Sturmann’s body, but no report of the results appears to have been made public. Jarrett Martin Drake, a Harvard PhD candidate in anthropology, cast doubt on the suicide claim in a 2021 paper, noting that the troupe was soon to return home and that the other performers had no prior concerns about Sturmann’s mental health. He also wonders if the fact that Sturmann’s death occurred two weeks after the start of the Civil War suggests that he might have been a victim of the racial rage that fueled the war.“I don’t know what happened to Sturmann, but I don’t believe he took his own life,” Drake said in an interview. “I know how to read press reports, and if you go where the silence is, you can usually hear a lot. This is strangely silent, and for that reason I felt it was shouting at me.”In the months after Sturmann’s death, his remains were taken on a journey that saw him increasingly stripped of his personhood, identified only by catalogue number or as “the Hottentot,” as scientists poked and prodded at what was left of him. As Willoughby put it in his book, “Masters of Health: Racial Science and Slavery in U.S. Medical Schools,” “Whites in Boston continued to use his body to craft a narrative of white supremacy.”Shortly after Sturmann died, his body was given to Harvard anatomist Jeffries Wyman, the president of the Boston Society of Natural History. Wyman dissected the teenager’s body at Harvard, according to the school’s 2022 report, and then may have given the skeleton to his colleague Louis Agassiz, the founder of Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology and a leading proponent of “polygenism,” or the notion of a hierarchy of human origins. At some point, however, the entry in a catalogue of Harvard’s Warren Anatomical Museum, which initially said Sturmann’s skeleton was at the Zoology Museum, was amended to say that the skeleton was at the museum of the Boston Society of Natural History.“We have no further records regarding his remains,” Jonathan Swain, a Harvard spokesman, said.What Harvard does have are 10 plaster casts of “the head of a native Hottentot,” as the accession record of one of the casts described it, which were made immediately after the teenager’s death. While the casts are no longer on public display, photos taken by one researcher reveal a painted cast of a young man’s face with the light complexion and high cheekbones typical of the Khoekhoe people, his eyes closed and lips slightly parted.The BSNH was in the process of moving to a new location when it received Sturmann’s remains in June 1861. Somewhere in transit, his preserved brain was either destroyed or lost, according to differing records held by the society, now called the Museum of Science, Boston. An 1861 inscription found by the museum labels his remains “Skeleton of Hottentot — Brain destroyed in moving”; another BSNH catalogue says, “Skeleton of Hottentot … Brain lost in moving collection.”Brittany Contratto, senior archivist at the museum, says the collections were likely moved by animal-drawn wagons on poor roads, and some objects invariably sustained damage. But the museum said in a statement, “No definitive pronouncement can be made about the ultimate journey of Sturmann’s brain.”His skeleton, identified by the museum as #843, however, remained readily available to science. In 1864, the curator of the BSNH’s comparative anatomy department exhibited it at one of the society’s regular meetings. The following year, Wyman, who had taken the skeleton apart and examined it, published a paper titled “Observations on the Skeleton of a Hottentot.”What happened to Sturmann’s remains after that is a mystery. Like Harvard, the Museum of Science says “there is no record of his skeleton’s presence or removal” after 1864.More than a century and a half later, Sturmann's story is still not over. Six years ago, an associate professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa discovered the remains of nine individuals that had been unethically removed from their graves in the 1920s and donated to the school’s anatomy department. Sturmann might have been related to some of the nine, according to one of the principal professors on the UCT project, given the similarity of some of their names to his, including one with the last name Stuurman, spelled slightly differently.Anthony Mietas, a spokesman for the Stuurman family, says relatives are eager to explore any connections between the nine people’s remains and the young man who wound up in Boston, and they could even help locate his remains. Some geneticists say it might be possible to extract DNA from the casts at Harvard, though it is unclear whether it could be matched to DNA from other remains. The nine sets of remains were reburied last Sunday. Mietas hopes that if Sturmann’s remains are ever found, they will be returned to South Africa.",11558,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2023/12/03/sturmann-yanghis-remains-lost/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GOGY35Z2SZBGJC3R2QNNE2IM4Y.jpg&w=440

Politico,Israel widens evacuation orders as it shifts offensive to southern Gaza,2023-12-03 06:46:00,Associated Press,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Israel’s military on Sunday ordered more areas in and around Gaza’s second-largest city of Khan Younis to evacuate, as it shifted its offensive to the southern half of the territory where it says many Hamas leaders are hiding.Heavy bombardments were reported overnight and into Sunday in the area of Khan Younis and the southern city of Rafah, as well as parts of the north that had been the focus of Israel’s blistering air and ground campaign.Many of the territory’s 2.3 million people are crammed in the south after Israeli forces ordered civilians to leave the north in the early days of the 2-month-old war.Heavy bombardments were reported overnight and into Sunday in the area of Khan Younis and the southern city of Rafah, as well as parts of the north that had been the focus of Israel’s blistering air and ground campaign.Many of the territory’s 2.3 million people are crammed in the south after Israeli forces ordered civilians to leave the north in the early days of the 2-month-old war.With the resumption of fighting, hopes receded that another temporary truce could be negotiated. A weeklong cease-fire, which expired Friday, had facilitated the release of dozens of Gaza-held Israeli and foreign hostages and Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.“We will continue the war until we achieve all its goals, and it’s impossible to achieve those goals without the ground operation,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address Saturday night.On Sunday, the Israeli military widened evacuation orders in and around Khan Younis, asking residents of at least five more areas and neighborhoods to leave for their safety.Residents said the Israeli military dropped leaflets ordering residents to move south to Rafah or to a coastal area in the southwest. “Khan Younis city is a dangerous combat zone,” the leaflets read.U.N. monitors said in a report issued before the latest evacuation orders that the areas residents were told to leave make up about one-quarter of the territory of Gaza. The report said that these areas were home to nearly 800,000 people before the war.Ahead of a resumption of fighting, the United States, Israel’s closest ally, had warned Israel to avoid significant new mass displacement.The Israeli military said Sunday that its fighter jets and helicopters “struck terror targets in the Gaza Strip, including terror tunnel shafts, command centers and weapons storage facilities” overnight, while a drone killed five Hamas fighters.In northern Gaza, rescue teams with little equipment scrambled Sunday to dig through the rubble of buildings in the Jabaliya refugee camp and other neighborhoods in Gaza City in search for potential survivors and dead bodies.“They strike everywhere,” said Amal Radwan, a woman sheltering in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp. “There is the non-stop sound of explosions around us.”Mohamed Abu Abed, who lives in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in Gaza City, also said there were relentless airstrikes and artillery shelling in his neighborhood and surrounding areas.“The situation here is imaginable,” he said. “Death is everywhere. One can die in a flash.”The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said Saturday that the overall death toll in the strip since the Oct. 7 start of the war had surpassed 15,200, a sharp jump from the previous count of more than 13,300 on Nov. 20. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but it said 70% of the dead were women and children. It said more than 40,000 people had been wounded since the war began.U.S. appeals to protect civilians came after an offensive in the first weeks of the war devastated large areas of northern Gaza. Much of Gaza’s population is packed into the territory’s southern half. The territory itself, bordering Israel and Egypt to the south, is sealed, leaving residents with the only option of moving around within Gaza to avoid the bombings.“Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating,” U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters Saturday during the COP28 climate conference in Dubai.Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel was making “maximum effort” to protect civilians and the military has used leaflets, phone calls, and radio and TV broadcasts to urge Gazans to move from specific areas. He added that Israel is considering creating a security buffer zone that would not allow Gazans direct access to the border fence on foot.Israel says it targets Hamas operatives and blames civilian casualties on the militants, accusing them of operating in residential neighborhoods. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Israel says at least 78 of its soldiers have been killed in the offensive in northern Gaza.Bombardments on Saturday destroyed a block of about 50 residential buildings in the Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City and a six-story building in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya on the northern edge of the city, said the U.N.

He said the block had housed over 1,000 people.“Retrieving the martyrs is extremely difficult,” he said in video comments from the site of the attack.Meanwhile, Harris told Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in a meeting that “under no circumstances” would the U.S. permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, an ongoing siege of Gaza or the redrawing of its borders, according to a U.S. summary.The war was sparked by an Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and other militants that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in southern Israel. Around 240 people were taken captive.The renewed hostilities have heightened concerns for 137 hostages, who the Israeli military says are still being held after 105 were freed during the recent truce.

ABC,"Indonesia's Marapi volcano erupts, spewing ash plumes and blanketing several villages",2023-12-03 06:40:00,RAHMA NURJANA Associated Press,"PADANG, Indonesia -- Indonesia’s Mount Marapi in West Sumatra province erupted Sunday, spewing white-and-gray ash plumes more than 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the air and sending hot ash clouds several miles away.There were no immediate report of casualties, said Ahmad Rifandi, an official with Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center at the Marapi monitoring post. The two routes for climbers were closed after the eruption and villagers living on the slopes of the mountain were advised to stay 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from the crater’s mouth because of potential lava.About 70 climbers started their way up the nearly 2,900-meter (9,480-foot) mountain on Saturday and became stranded. So far, 28 have been successfully evacuated with the rest still awaiting rescue, said Dian Indriati, the acting head of North Sumatra’s conservation agency.A video on social media shows the climbers were evacuated to a shelter, their faces and hair smeared with volcanic dust and rain.National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said several villages were blanketed with falling ash, blocking out the sun in many areas.

NPR,The shadowy Hamas leader behind the war against Israel,2023-12-03 06:01:00,Daniel Estrin,"TEL AVIV, Israel — The deadly Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, dragging Israeli hostages back to Gaza, and high-stakes negotiations for their release could not have happened without the approval of one secretive man. Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, is widely believed to have helped mastermind the unprecedented Hamas attack that changed the course of Israeli-Palestinian history. He spent more than two decades behind bars in Israel, before being freed 12 years ago in a hostage ransom deal his brother helped negotiate. In early October, Sinwar outsmarted Israel with the same hostage-taking tactic — resulting in Israel's deadliest day on record. Now Israel seeks to eradicate the Islamist militant group Sinwar leads in Gaza. Israel, the United States, Europe and others designate Hamas as a terrorist organization, but its surprise attack earned it widespread support among Palestinians, many of whom regard it as resisting decades of Israeli subjugation. Israel also vows to kill Sinwar, a short, wiry man with cropped white hair. Israeli leaders have deemed him a psychopath. Israelis and Palestinians presume Sinwar is hiding underground somewhere in Gaza, negotiating with world powers over hostage releases, trying to outmaneuver Israel, and surviving another day. Born on Oct. 29, 1962, according to Hamas, Sinwar helped found the group's internal security apparatus in the late 1980s. He earned a nickname among Palestinians: the butcher of Khan Younis, where he grew up in southern Gaza. His role in Hamas for years was to help root out suspected Palestinian informants for Israel. He was imprisoned in Israel on four life sentences, accused of playing a role in killing Israeli soldiers and Palestinian collaborators with Israel. ""He [has] so many secrets,"" says his former prison mate, Esmat Mansour, who now serves as a commentator of current affairs in Arabic-language media. Mansour recalls, Sinwar assembled a small team of confidants who would smuggle cellphones into prison, interrogate new prisoners about how they had been caught preparing an attack against Israel, and catch Palestinian inmates serving as informants for Israel. ""So many spies,"" Mansour says, speaking to NPR in the Palestinian city of Ramallah. In 2006, Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was captured by Hamas and held hostage in Gaza for five years. The man who guarded the captive soldier was none other than Sinwar's own brother, Mohammed. In 2011, Hamas freed the captive soldier in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Sinwar's brother made sure Sinwar was among them. ""All the prisoners [looked] at him as a man who can decide about their life,"" Mansour says. His VIP status in prison, and return to Gaza with the released prisoners, helped Sinwar rise in the ranks to lead Hamas in Gaza. Over the years, security-conscious Sinwar rarely appeared in public. But he did meet with the foreign press twice around periods of conflict with Israel. ""Your presence for us is a big accomplishment and asset for our people and our cause,"" he told the visiting journalists at a 2018 press conference in Gaza City that lasted two hours. Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas militant group's leader in the Gaza Strip, speaks to international press, including NPR, in Gaza City on Nov. 21, 2018. Khalil Hamra/AP hide caption Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas militant group's leader in the Gaza Strip, speaks to international press, including NPR, in Gaza City on Nov. 21, 2018. At the time, Hamas was holding two Israeli citizens and the bodies of two killed Israeli soldiers. NPR asked Sinwar about the captives. Sinwar said it was a confidential file he wasn't prepared to talk about. Hamas is still holding them today. At the time, Hamas was encouraging violent protests along the Israeli border fence of the blockaded Gaza Strip. He said it was a strategy he learned from his hunger strikes in Israeli prison — he said Palestinians in Gaza were protesting their Israeli jailers for better conditions. The strategy seemed to work. Hamas and Israel, which do not speak directly to each other, reached an indirect arrangement known as ""quiet for quiet."" Hamas agreed to cool hostilities and Israel agreed to ease Gaza's high unemployment rate, granting coveted Israeli work permits to thousands of laborers from the territory. A 2021 Hamas-Israel war interrupted that deal. Sinwar gave another press conference to foreign media after the war, denying that Hamas had routed international humanitarian aid to its clandestine effort to build underground tunnels for Hamas fighters. Israel's permits for workers from Gaza resumed, and surged to higher numbers, while fighting between Gaza and Israel ceased. The number of work permits Israel granted Gaza laborers, before the current war, surpassed 8,000. Eyal Hulata, who served as Israel's national security adviser last year, thought this strategy bought Israel some quiet on the Gaza border. ""I don't know. I thought we had an understanding what Sinwar's thinking was, and this was so wrong,"" Hulata told NPR in a recent briefing with journalists. Israel was shocked on Oct. 7, when Hamas fighters stormed the border, killed about 1,200 people and took back to Gaza more than 250 captives. David Meidan, the Israeli negotiator who, along with other officials, approved Sinwar's release from prison in the 2011 exchange of prisoners for one Israeli captive soldier, says Sinwar's strategy with the Oct. 7 attack was similar. ""First of all, to capture maximum hostages, and to use them as a tool to release his friends,"" Meidan says. Sinwar has not yet secured the release of his fellow prison mates with whom he spent years behind bars in Israel. But last week, Israel freed Palestinian women and minors jailed in recent weeks and years, in exchange for Hamas releasing some of its Israeli hostages. During that time, both sides agreed to a temporary cease-fire in the war. For every 10 hostages Hamas released per day, Israel extended the cease-fire another day and released 30 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Meidan said it helped Sinwar buy time. ""He needs time now,"" Meidan says. ""The time will help him to survive."" Many Israelis worried that the pause in fighting would help Hamas fighters regroup, and leave more time for international pressure to mount against Israel resuming its military assault. But Israel renewed combat in Gaza on Friday, following a dispute over the kind of hostages Hamas offered to release and renewed Gaza rocket fire onto Israel. Sinwar will likely keep holding onto Israeli captive soldiers as a bargaining chip for his bigger goal: to secure the release of all Palestinian prisoners. Israel currently jails 7,677 Palestinian ""security"" inmates, according to the Israeli legal aid group HaMoked. ""We are ready to conduct an immediate prisoner exchange deal that includes the release of all Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in exchange for all prisoners held by the Palestinian resistance,"" Sinwar said in an Oct. 28 statement. Opinion polls in October showed large Israeli support for such a comprehensive prisoner swap.

""When they end the war, they will make negotiations to release all the prisoners, and then it will be the biggest picture of victory in Palestinian history,"" says Mansour, Sinwar's former prison mate. After the last Israel-Hamas war in 2021, Sinwar dared Israel to assassinate him, and walked openly in the streets of Gaza. Today, as the 2023 war is not yet complete, Sinwar is on Israel's hit list. ""We will get to Yahya Sinwar, and we will assassinate him,"" said Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant last month, ""I say here, to the residents of Gaza, if you get (to him) before us, it will shorten the war.""",8015,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/03/1216138367/hamas-gaza-leader-yahya-sinwar,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/11/30/gettyimages-1251823752_slide-f8c05688bfe1dce3e0e7714e66ff2407915b8f2a-s1100-c50.jpg,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,national hamas large medium ransom earn gallant meidan hulata course big body hamoked deny visit number designate adviser fellow renew shalit woman storm yoav dare change goal return public bought statement mount foreign citizen encourage spent permit detainee held journalist outmaneuver similar thousand esmat grow current quiet october back clandestine hit deadliest openly laborer organization make extend leader official wrong lead power israel meet rarely jaafar early cool combat resistance nickname informant pressure aid strip kind secure defense vip high surge grant prepared leave status fire friend rise hold supporter thursday mastermind accomplishment side give covet small image role ease shock widely briefing interrupt week militant rocket gilad surpass cellphone life rate dispute comprehensive minister deadly day collaborator affair negotiation rout record street learn today presence hide swap happen agree born capture caught time brother freed deem terrorist butcher ago late world talk work protest resist cropped subjugation jail attack condition chip surprise imprison buy underground understand accord found tactic fence blockade khan violent resident commentator presume exchange shorten caption unprecedented hostage conference walk directly palestinian regroup tunnel release state unemployment worried eyal city accuse decide newly ready mate npr tool approval wiry group hiding resume suspect yahya complete fighter getty confidant seek security sentence history younis result believe root negotiator confidential strategy apparatus fight gaza ramallah serf year secretive soldier approve pause islamist hour strike territory offer secret temporary reach assault conflict recent humanitarian team israeli international outsmart catch captive surround maximum asset build hunger bank deal press conduct worker negotiate currently support smuggle mansour jailer poll guard aviv opinion david cease white bar kill border short bargaining psychopath europe play decade military month list khalil eradicate show speak tel speaks sinwar indirect southern hair prisoner assassinate follow arrangement victory united west picture hostility internal effort rank spy immediate vow include survive told prepare assemble serve mohammed drag prison occupy legal widespread former interrogate minor inmate friday file period recall regard,-0.98105,0.411728009981285,9.248679495686794,0.3754291289518562,0,2023-12-03
NPR,"Gaza war is deadliest conflict for journalists in over 30 years, press advocates say",2023-12-03 06:00:00,Fatima Al-Kassab,"Journalists, relatives and friends pray over the bodies of journalists Sari Mansour and Hassouna Esleem after they were killed in an Israeli bombardment at Bureij camp in the central Gaza Strip on Nov. 19. LONDON — ""This might be the last video I post,"" Ayat Khaddoura, a Palestinian journalist and podcaster, said in a post on Instagram Oct. 13. It was one of many videos Khaddoura had been sharing with her hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, talking about living under Israeli bombardment and trying to survive with limited water and electricity. A post shared by Ayat Khaddoura (@ayatkhaddoura.vo) On Nov. 6, in a video she called her ""last message to the world,"" she said: ""We used to have big dreams, but now our dream is only to be killed in one piece so people know who we are."" A week later, she was dead. An Israeli airstrike on her home in northern Gaza killed her. The Committee to Protect Journalists says the Israel-Gaza war has ""led to the deadliest month for journalists"" since it started gathering data in 1992. Of 61 deaths of journalists and media workers CPJ has recorded as of Friday, 54 were Palestinian journalists, four were Israeli and three were Lebanese. By comparison, according to CPJ, a total of 68 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide in all of 2022. That total includes deaths in conflicts around the world, and those due to dangerous assignments, targeted killings and crossfire. The rising toll comes as the Israel-Hamas war enters its third month, and Israel continues its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which has so far killed more than 13,300 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. Israel's offensive is in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. Press freedom advocates have decried that journalists, even when they're visibly marked as press, are among the casualties in Gaza. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based nonprofit, says the majority of Gaza journalist casualties since the start of the war were killed while doing their jobs. The organization classifies 43 of the 50 journalists killed so far as being on a ""dangerous assignment."" It says investigations into the circumstances of the deaths are ongoing and that it is investigating whether some were targeted attacks. ""The Israeli army is making choices and those choices to use lethal force against journalists and media facilities have to be warranted and proportional. Failing to do so constitutes possible war crimes,"" says Sherif Mansour, coordinator for the CPJ's Middle East program. Of those killed, 90% have been Palestinian journalists and media workers in Gaza. The organization says the four Israeli journalists were killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel. It has confirmed that two of them were working at the time. The three Lebanese journalists were killed while on duty in Lebanon on the Israeli border, in what their respective organizations believe were targeted attacks. Al-Mayadeen TV journalist Farah Omar had given a live update an hour before she was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel's military denies targeting Palestinian or other journalists and says it tries to avoid civilian casualties. Gaza's journalists have shouldered the responsibility of telling the world what is happening while also suffering personal losses and tragedies during the war. Their task of newsgathering has been made more difficult by communication blackouts in Gaza, where phone and internet links have gone down periodically throughout the war. Palestinian officials blame Israel for severing lines and limiting fuel deliveries to power telecom towers and generators. Some Gaza journalists, including those working with international outlets, may receive support such as the provision of protective gear and equipment. Others who work on a freelance basis do not. Gaza-based journalists may also work for local outlets that are coming under bombardment themselves. But the risks are high for all in the besieged territory — most people in Gaza cannot get out. The Israeli military told Reuters and the Agence France-Presse that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip, after the news agencies had sought assurances that their journalists would not be targeted by Israeli strikes, Reuters reported. Nour Swirki, a freelance journalist who is currently living in a shelter in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, says it has become increasingly difficult to carry on reporting when fearing for her life and that of her family. She is a mother of two. ""I am playing two roles in this war: the professional one as a journalist, and as a mother. I'm terrified of losing myself as a civilian, as a journalist,"" she tells NPR in a voice message. ""I'm always thinking, what if something happens to my children. It's not an easy situation for us, as journalists, male and female, and as mothers and fathers."" Salman al-Bashir, a journalist for the Palestinian Authority's TV channel, tore off his protective gear in the middle of a live broadcast when he found out his colleague, Mohammed Abu Hatab, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. ""We are victims, live on air,"" he cried. ""It is only a matter of time until we are killed. We wait our turn, one after the other."" Al Jazeera's Gaza correspondent Wael al-Dahdouh was broadcasting when he received the news that his family had been killed by an Israeli airstrike. His wife, son and daughter, grandson and at least eight other relatives were all killed in an Israeli attack on the home they had been sheltering in. Moments after he learned the news, the channel switched to footage of him, still wearing his press vest, kneeling over the body of his son. When he came back on air days later, he told viewers that despite his pain and ""open wound,"" he felt it was his duty to get back in front of the camera and carry on reporting. Hind Khoudary, a 28-year-old freelance journalist, says she feels disheartened that international correspondents were able to come in on embeds with the Israeli military when local reporters in Gaza had no information about what was happening to the homes and families they were forced to leave behind in the north of Gaza. Khoudary, like many others, fled her home in Gaza City after the Israeli military told people there to move south. Her house was destroyed by Israeli airstrikes. Communication blackouts have made it difficult for people in Gaza to know what is happening in other parts of the territory. ""I feel so sad seeing the Fox News and CNN correspondents, visiting Gaza and reporting about what's going on, when me and my colleagues who are Palestinian journalists, we have been here since day one,"" she says. ""We were forced to flee our homes, we don't know anything about what is happening in the north, we don't know anything about our families. We don't know what's bombed, what's not bombed, who's injured, who's killed, we literally know nothing,"" Khoudary says. Plestia Alaqad, a 22-year-old freelance Palestinian journalist, posted a photo of her press jacket on Instagram last week. ""I used to always wear my press vest and helmet... but lately I stopped wearing them,"" she wrote in an accompanying caption. ""I don't feel safe in Gaza no matter what ... especially when wearing [the] press vest and helmet."" A post shared by Plestia Alaqad | بلستيا العقاد (@byplestia) ""I hope this nightmare ends soon, I hope we don't lose anymore journalists,"" she wrote. Alaqad has since left Gaza. She told her followers on social media that she left out of fears that her role as a journalist was putting herself and her family at greater risk. Before she left, Alaqad had been documenting the war in Gaza to her 4 million Instagram followers, who watched her flee her home, walk around her neighborhood after it was reduced to rubble and shelter in the dark during power blackouts. In most of her posts, she wore her protective press vest. Other Palestinian journalists also say they feel less safe wearing a press vest. They say they believe being identified as members of the press could make them and their families targets for Israeli forces. A post shared by Plestia Alaqad | بلستيا العقاد (@byplestia) ""I don't feel safe at all with the press vest,"" Swirki tells NPR. ""As journalists here, it is considered part of the danger and risk, to wear this vest."" She believes some of her colleagues have been targeted by Israel. ""There is no safe place at all in the Gaza Strip. And with these targets for our colleagues we know we aren't protected. We are facing death every single moment in the field,"" Swirki says. But the Committee to Protect Journalists says it has found evidence of the Israeli army targeting journalists in the past. It points to the case of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who was shot dead last year while reporting in the occupied West Bank. Human rights groups and news outlets concluded after independent investigations that the Palestinian American journalist was killed in a targeted attack by Israeli troops. She was wearing a press vest at the time. The Israel Defense Forces later acknowledged the ""high possibility"" one of its soldiers shot Abu Akleh but said there wasn't evidence they intentionally targeted her. ""The IDF have not respected [press] insignia in the past,"" says Sherif Mansour, coordinator for the CPJ's Middle East program. A CPJ report published in May showed the majority of the journalists killed by the Israeli military in the past 22 years had press insignia showing on their bodies and their vehicles. ""What we have seen in this war is a deadly pattern becoming more deadly,"" Mansour says. He says it's a pattern that has wider implications for a war in which foreign press has largely been unable to report on what is going on in Gaza, and where there have been several communication blackouts. ""This pattern leaves Palestinian journalists in a precarious situation and leads to a chilling effect about covering IDF operations,"" says Mansour. Mansour says this makes the work of Palestinian journalists in Gaza all the more vital — and attacks on them all the more troubling for those trying to understand the conflict. ""Millions around the world rely on journalists to have accurate information and commentary,"" says Mansour. ""Without them, we end up with a sea of mis- and disinformation that can only fuel the conflict.""",10511,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/03/1215798409/palestinian-journalists-killed-gaza-israel-hamas-war,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,conclude confirm central vest decry middle electricity reduce hamas bureij broadcast classifies water medium suffer social cnn body enters big south swirki visit target provision casualty broadcasting bombed past feel salman wider foreign daughter ongoing tower crossfire live carry put insignia human authority instagram constitutes especially journalist khoudary marked generator share consider thousand responsibility american call back deadliest front organization make cpj esleem official fear lead power moment single israel air video member effect khaddoura strip victim nightmare avoid chill difficult blame defense shot shoulder situation high comparison anymore العقاد leave sought friend force rise felt tv left photo advocate protective colleague give communication shelter role investigate rely bombardment outlet army point reporting jacket week female denies blackout hatab camp life akleh deadly million day safety record fox plestia possible troop learn start intentionally wear possibility happen injured living wait investigation killing time largely accompany freelance besiege news idf world ayat dark ministry talk work task civilian attack telecom agency part pain understand committee accord fail father found khan gathering tore post increasingly cover death sari viewer caption literally northern hostage walk stop palestinian circumstance wael relative majority local professional kneel despite acknowledge field crime city wore byplestia vehicle npr easy protect group health line disinformation equipment switch fuel shireen duty embeds precarious reporter place lebanese airstrikes lebanon facility piece voice turn evidence younis operating believe hundred write home response neighborhood assurance receive message gaza offensive continue internet family dream phone correspondent year pray soldier hour publish territory strike tragedy rubble move wife respective warrant newsgathering pattern identify channel conflict mother israeli north omar international abu total watch case airstrike report nour follower safe helmet data bank accurate cry worldwide terrify male document grandson press hassouna worker freedom currently limited sad job implication personal support hind destroyed mansour link proportional risk information matter great kill border reuters visibly danger play military lose month show lethal wound hope commentary dishearten independent southern agence toll unable footage dangerous podcaster farah assignment loss choice alaqad leaf west jazeera house بلستيا nonprofit include respect open flee survive told trouble periodically east coordinator delivery due mohammed camera occupy vital sever sherif operation dead basis program friday guarantee update limit child london gear,-0.99605,0.7991627818475884,8.550661401776896,0.3301829441602169,0,2023-12-03

LONDON and RAMALLAH, Israeli-occupied West Bank — Rimah Shahada's living room is filled with deflated balloons. For the past week, she'd been preparing a homecoming celebration — with balloons, stuffed animals and welcome home cards — for her 17-year-old daughter, Aseel, who's been in an Israeli prison hospital since Nov. 11. Aseel was shot in the leg that day by Israeli soldiers, who said she lunged at them with scissors at a military checkpoint near the refugee camp where the Shahada family lives, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The teenager is one of thousands of people arrested in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli prison service figures, Palestinian officials and human rights groups. Many of them, like Shahada, are being held without charge or trial. Israel released about 240 Palestinian detainees and prisoners, in exchange for over 100 hostages freed by Hamas, as part of a weeklong truce that ended Friday.

""We can't reach her, no one tells us anything about her,"" Shahada says of her daughter. ""And now they're hitting Gaza again. God be with the martyrs in Gaza. I hope this war ends."" When Hamas militants stormed parts of southern Israel on Oct. 7, they killed about 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages back to the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli officials. Since then, Israel's bombardment and invasion of Gaza have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians there, according to health officials in Gaza. Both Hamas and Israel say a prime aim is to free the prisoners or captives held by the other side. After the past week's swaps, Israel estimates 137 hostages are still held in Gaza. The resumption of fighting between Israel and Hamas has dashed hopes of families like the Shahadas for the further release of the more than 10,000 Palestinians who remain in Israeli jails. Aseel Shahada's name had been published on an Israeli government database of Palestinian prisoners eligible for release as part of the temporary truce with Hamas — which gave her family hope that her release was imminent. But only about 240 of the 350 names published were released before the exchanges stopped Friday. Another woman from their refugee camp was among those released in the past week. Shahada's name was just after hers on the list. Her mother believes that if the truce had held for one more day, she would have been reunited with her daughter.

Shahada's family says the teenager was upset about the Gaza war, but denies she was ever violent. They say they don't know how she could have gotten a weapon on her way home from school that day. They haven't been able to talk to her since the incident. As of Friday, Israel was holding 7,677 Palestinians as what it deems security inmates, and another 2,873 Palestinians as administrative detainees — which means they can be held without charge, indefinitely. More than 1,500 of the arrests were made in November alone. These figures were sent to NPR by HaMoked, an Israeli nonprofit that offers legal aid to Palestinians living under occupation. It draws data directly from Israel's prison service. The top Palestinian official overseeing prisoners' affairs, Qadoura Fares, who belongs to the Fatah party, Hamas' rival, says more than 3,000 Palestinians have been arrested in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in total since Oct. 7. ""The majority of them, 90% of them, are victims — not prisoners,"" Fares told NPR in an interview last week at his office in Ramallah. He says most of them are minors accused of nonviolent offenses. ""These are people Israel has decided to arrest for endangering Israeli security — without clarifying why, how, with whom,"" Fares says. Fares accuses Israel of stepping up arrest raids during the latest Gaza war, in order to intimidate Palestinian communities and also have more detainees to negotiate with in prisoner exchanges. A Palestinian official overseeing prisoner affairs, Qadoura Fares, sits in his office in Ramallah, West Bank, on Nov. 22. Fares was also released as part of a prisoner exchange deal in 1994 after being held in prison for 13 years.

Fares was also released as part of a prisoner exchange deal in 1994 after being held in prison for 13 years. Israel acknowledges stepping up arrest raids. It says it's targeting members of Hamas and other militant groups in order to thwart future attacks — especially during a time of war. Hamas' ability to penetrate Israeli security — to kill and kidnap so many people on Oct. 7 — prompted many Israelis to ask whether militants had help from Palestinians elsewhere, including in the West Bank. Polls show wide support for Hamas in the West Bank, and there have been demonstrations there in support of the militant group. The West Bank has been under Israeli military occupation since Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war. Under Israeli military law, Palestinian suspects can be held for up to eight days before seeing a judge — who can then classify them as administrative detainees, and extend their seizure indefinitely. Before this war, the United Nations and human rights groups had criticized the application of military law to Palestinian civilians. They've also criticized the uptick in Israeli arrest raids since the war began. ""The scale of detentions and arrests [of Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem] since the 7th of October, and those without charges or trial, is unprecedented,"" Budour Hassan, an Amnesty International researcher based in the West Bank, tells NPR. ""Palestinian detainees are telling us about humiliation and reprisals, even though they had nothing to do with the Oct. 7 attacks. It's a tactic of collective reprisal against all Palestinians."" The prison figures show that out of a total of at least 10,550 Palestinians in Israeli custody, nearly 40% of them are held without charge. Many of them are accused of nonviolent offenses. Last month, Israel amended its counterterrorism law to make ""consumption of terrorist materials"" — reading or sharing content considered pro-Hamas online, for example — a new criminal offense. The law has been criticized by rights groups groups, including Article 19 and Adalah, as being ambiguous and far-reaching. ""It makes thoughts subject to criminal punishment ... and criminalizes even passive social media use,"" the human rights group Adalah says. That's what happened to Ayah Jalal Mohammed Tamimi. The 20-year-old college student was arrested at her home in East Jerusalem on Oct. 9, two days after the Gaza war began, and accused of incitement — for a post on Instagram Stories, which quoted the Quran. (The post expired after 24 hours, so NPR was not able to verify Tamimi's account. She says it was simply a Quranic verse, posted without commentary.) Tamimi spent 50 nights in jail before being released Tuesday, as part of the now-halted nightly exchanges of hostages and prisoners that were part of the temporary Israel-Hamas truce. She was never charged, and wasn't allowed a phone call from jail — not to a lawyer or her family, she says. ""They gave us plain bread. But we were always hungry, and it was cold,"" Tamimi tells NPR by phone from her home in East Jerusalem.

Last month, Israel's national security minister declared a three-month ""prison emergency,"" which allows for prisoners to be given floor mattresses, rather than beds. The text of the declaration says that ""many more detainees are expected to be absorbed in the near future in view of the state of war."" Another freed prisoner, 17-year-old Malik Mohammed Arafat Deeba, says he felt that change. Israeli prison conditions worsened after the war broke out, he says. Deeba was arrested in his East Jerusalem neighborhood last summer for stone-throwing — something he denies. He too was never charged, but was jailed for five months, before being released Tuesday as part of the now-halted truce. ""After the war began, the food got really bad, and they didn't give us enough of it,"" Deeba tells NPR by phone. ""We were treated terribly. They cut us off from the world, we had no way of contacting our families."" His mother, Nihal Deeba, tells NPR she had been allowed to visit her son in jail until Oct. 7, when such visits were halted. She has another son, Arafat, age 20, who remains in Israeli custody. She'd been hoping the truce would last longer, and that he too might be freed. ""These are our children, our brothers and sisters,"" Nihal Deeba says. ""I pray that all the prisoners are freed, and that the prisons are emptied."" Most of the Palestinians freed during the past week's exchanges were teenage boys. They also included several teenage girls and several dozen adult women. The gender of some of them is unclear, because their names could be male or female. Most of them are listed as being from the West Bank and Jerusalem. None had been convicted of murder. Some have been accused or convicted of violence, including stabbings that injured Israeli security officers or civilians. Other offenses include stone-throwing, incitement and membership in what Israel considers a terrorist group. Before the releases, Israel published lists of names of jailed Palestinians who were eligible to be part of the exchanges. It allowed Israeli citizens to petition their Supreme Court if they objected to any of the names. Some groups representing victims of terrorist attacks said they planned to appeal some names. But the court historically has not intervened to block such releases, and it did not do so this week. Among some 30 Palestinians released Wednesday night was Ahed Tamimi, now 22, who as a teenager became a symbol of Palestinian defiance to military occupation. In 2017, a video went viral showing Tamimi slapping and kicking Israeli soldiers in her home village in the West Bank. She pleaded guilty to assault charges, and has been in and out of Israeli prison since then. (Ahed Tamimi has no relation to Ayah Jalal Mohammed Tamimi.)

Ahed Tamimi had been arrested again last month, this time for an Instagram post. Israeli media say the post referred to Adolf Hitler and contained threats to ""slaughter"" Jews. Her family says there are dozens of fake accounts under Tamimi's name, and that she did not post the message in question. The account it was posted on, which carried Tamimi's name and photo, has since been deleted.

NPR,More than 100 Gaza heritage sites have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli attacks,2023-12-03 06:00:00,Chloe Veltman,"In the weeks since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and destroyed thousands of homes in the territory. And there have also been tremendous losses to the region's ancient and globally significant cultural heritage. The region was a hub for commerce and culture under Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine rule. It remained influential for centuries thereafter. A recent survey by the group Heritage for Peace details the damage done so far to more than 100 of these landmarks in Gaza since the start of the present conflict. The casualties include the Great Omari Mosque, one of the most important and ancient mosques in historical Palestine; the Church of Saint Porphyrius, thought to be the third oldest church in the entire world; a 2,000-year-old Roman cemetery in northern Gaza excavated only last year; and the Rafah Museum, a space in southern Gaza which was dedicated to teaching about the territory's long and multi-layered heritage — until it was hammered by airstrikes early on in the conflict. Israel says it is pursuing Hamas in an effort to destroy it and to rescue hostages. It accuses Hamas of operating out of civilian areas, including hospitals and mosques.

It added the survey was generated in response ""to the requests and desires of numerous concerned individuals, researchers, and local residents to shed light on the status of cultural heritage.""

Marco Longari/AFP via Getty Images hide caption ""If this heritage be no more in Gaza, it will be a big loss of the identity of the people in Gaza,"" said Isber Sabrine, president of Heritage for Peace, in an interview with NPR. Sabrine said his organization plans to continue the work of surveying and monitoring the status of cultural landmarks in Gaza over the coming months, both on the ground in collaboration with locals, as well as using satellite imagery. ""The people in Gaza, they have the right to keep and to save this heritage, to tell the history, the importance of this land,"" he said. The 1954 Hague Convention, agreed to by Palestinians and Israelis, is supposed to safeguard landmarks from the ravages of war. But landmarks in Gaza have been destroyed by Israeli strikes in earlier rounds of fighting. Dozens of sites, including the now-obliterated Great Omari Mosque, suffered damage in 2014. A report by UNESCO, the United Nations body that designates and protects World Heritage sites, cites further destruction to cultural and historic sites in Gaza in 2021. ""UNESCO is deeply concerned about the adverse impact of the ongoing fighting on cultural heritage in Palestine and Israel,"" said a UNESCO spokesperson in a statement sent to NPR. ""Our organization calls on all parties involved to strictly adhere to international law. Cultural property should not be targeted or used for military purposes, as it is considered to be civilian infrastructure."" Damage at the historical Great Omari Mosque on Aug. 2, 2014. Mohammed Abed/AFP via Getty Images hide caption UNESCO has as yet been unable to survey the extent of the damage to the area's cultural heritage. ""Due to the ongoing fighting and the impossibility of accessing the area, UNESCO is not in a position to assess the damage itself on site,"" the agency's statement said. ""At this stage, our experts can only monitor the situation remotely, using satellite data and information transmitted to us by third parties. This information must then be scrupulously verified."" The Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities did not respond to NPR's request to share information about the current status of Gaza's cultural heritage sites or salvaging plans. According to a report in The Art Newspaper, the ministry said it is ""at present unable to carry out a full assessment given the conditions on the ground."" Israel's military did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on the Heritage for Peace report. Locals are only now starting to take stock of the damage caused by the present fighting. ""When we move around Gaza, we feel very angry and very sad as well,"" said Gaza City Mayor Yahya al-Sarraj in a video report by Al Jazeera.

CNN,Israel recalls negotiators after reaching ‘dead end’ in Qatar talks,2023-12-03 03:22:00,Tamar Michaelis,"Israeli authorities recalled their team of negotiators from Qatar after reaching a “dead end” in talks to release hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to a statement released by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.The talks in the Gulf nation had led to a tenuous truce between Hamas and Israel that lasted seven days before collapsing on Friday morning.In the statement, Israel blamed Hamas for failing to “fulfill its part of the agreement, which included the return of all women and children held hostage.”The negotiators were from Israel’s Mossad intelligence service and the statement said it was the head of the agency, David Barnea, who recalled the team.A source familiar with the talks told CNN that they broke down on Saturday after Israel continued to insist on the release of a group of women and Hamas refused.As the diplomatic process stood at an impasse, Hamas pushed to begin discussing the release of men – possibly on a different set of terms, according to the source. Israel rejected that idea, insisting that it was imperative that all women be released first.Hamas in a statement held Israel and the United States responsible for ending the dialogue. The militant group said Israel refused its offers to exchange prisoners and hand over the bodies of hostages it said had died during the bombardment of Gaza.Saleh Al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas’ political bureau, confirmed to Al Jazeera TV on Saturday that negotiations had ended, adding there would be no more hostages released until there is a ceasefire.The remaining hostages still being held by Hamas are current or former soldiers, Al-Arouri said, adding that adult males will be subject to different standards by Hamas.﻿“We said from day one that the price for releasing Zionist prisoners is the liberation of all our prisoners, after the ceasefire,” Al-Arouri said.Israeli and US officials believe that Hamas continues to hold hostage a number of women in their twenties and thirties, many of them kidnapped from the Nova music festival. Hamas has insisted that some of the remaining women they were holding hostage were considered a part of the IDF, which Israel denies.The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that there are 136 hostages still being held in Gaza, including 17 women and children. It is unclear how many of those are being held by Hamas as opposed to other militant groups that operate in the territory.Qatari and American mediators are still working to find a way to bring back a temporary stop in the fighting, Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters on Saturday after speaking with the Emir of Qatar on the sidelines of the COP28 climate summit in Dubai.“Our work is ongoing to support some ability to reopen the pause and to have a deal going forward where there will be a pause so that we can get hostages out and get aid in,” Harris said at a news conference.Harris also said that while the US supports Israel’s “legitimate military objectives” in Gaza, the civilian suffering inside the enclave has been too high.“As Israel defends itself, it matters how,” she said. “Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering, and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating.”The Israel Defense Forces said it carried out more than 400 strikes in the first 24 hours of renewed fighting that began Friday morning, targeting both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza.The Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said Saturday that most of the victims were women and children, and dozens are feared dead after the apparent bombardment of a multi-story concrete building in the Jabalya refugee camp.Among the victims was Dr. Sufyan Tayeh, a prominent Palestinian scientist and the president of the Islamic University of Gaza, according to a statement by the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research. He was killed alongside his family, the statement said.﻿Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said in a statement late Saturday that it had launched a barrage of rockets from northern Gaza toward Tel Aviv.The group claimed the attack was in response to what it called “Zionist massacres against civilians.”Despite the resumption of hostilities, the two sides on Friday continued to negotiate in Qatar through mediators to pause the fighting in exchange for the release of more hostages, sources said.However, negotiators began expressing concern before Friday’s collapse that Hamas may no longer be holding enough women and children to get Israel to continue pauses in fighting.Israel had agreed to extend the truce daily for every 10 hostages Hamas released. It released three Palestinian prisoners in exchange for every hostage.",4736,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/middleeast/israel-hamas-qatar-talks-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/191001115139-mj-lee-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,festival confirm tayeh impasse hamas concern prime collapse suffer cnn mediator body bring number target morning renew liberation woman benjamin operate claimed statement return subject research ongoing carry diplomatic sideline authority ability held refugee standard consider american current call back push islamic extend official lead fear political israel video barrage service aid dozen agreement victim adult blame defense high brigade alongside force oppose head sufyan vice hold continued tv legitimate wing side image music bombardment scientific nova innocent netanyahu militant emir rocket express set minister summit scientist day negotiation concrete jabalya begin remain president inside massacre agree enclave recall news idf kidnap late ministry talk intelligence broke work gulf jihad civilian idea attack hand agency part possibly accord fail responsible imperative education exchange frankly northern reject hostage stop building palestinian nation despite defends scale release state apparent stood group health fulfill resumption different twenty reporter tenuous believe response negotiator fight harris gaza continue term family soldier pause mossad offer hour strike temporary reach team israeli add reopen familiar unclear saturday deal male negotiate barnea thirty forward support truce prominent price david matter bureau qatar kill source longer military refuse speak tel objective deputy find zionist climate prisoner process united university hostility launch jazeera ceasefire dialogue include told kamala former dead daily friday insist child discuss,-0.9734,0.1900337837837837,11.614584323040376,0.3941168091168091,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Israel says military offensive in crowded southern Gaza will be 'no less strength' than in the north,2023-12-03 03:21:00,NAJIB JOBAIN Associated Press and KAREEM CHEHAYEB Associated Press,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip -- The Israeli military said Sunday it had expanded its ground operations to every part of Gaza and ordered more evacuations in the crowded south, followed by heavy bombardment, as it vowed that operations there against Hamas would be “no less strength” than its earlier offensive in the north.Palestinians in the Gaza Strip said they were running out of places to go in the sealed-off territory that borders Israel and Egypt. Many of its 2.3 million people are crammed into the south after Israel ordered civilians to leave the north in the early days of the war, which was sparked by the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and other militants that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in southern Israel.The United Nations estimates that 1.8 million Gazans have been displaced. Juliette Toma, director of communications at the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said nearly 958,000 of them were in 99 U.N. facilities in the south.Heavy bombardment was reported around Gaza’s second-largest city of Khan Younis in the south and the nearby city of Rafah. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk urged an end to the war, saying civilian suffering was “too much to bear.”The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said the death toll there since Oct. 7 has surpassed 15,500. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, but said 70% of the dead were women and children. It said more than 41,000 people had been wounded.A Health Ministry spokesman asserted that hundreds of people had been killed or wounded since the cease-fire ended. “The majority of victims are still under the rubble,” Ashraf al-Qidra said.Meanwhile, fears of a wider conflict intensified. A U.S. warship and multiple commercial ships came under attack Sunday in the Red Sea, the Pentagon said. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed attacks on two ships they described as being linked to Israel but did not acknowledge targeting a U.S. Navy vessel.Hopes for another temporary truce in Gaza were fading. A weeklong cease-fire that expired Friday facilitated the release of dozens of the roughly 240 Gaza-held Israeli and foreign hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. But Israel has called its negotiators home, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war will continue until “all its goals” are achieved. One is to remove Hamas from power in Gaza.Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said resuming talks with Israel on further exchanges must be tied to a permanent cease-fire.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the U.S. is working ""really hard” for a resumption of negotiations.Israel's military widened evacuation orders in and around Khan Younis, telling residents of at least five more areas to leave. Residents said the military dropped leaflets ordering them to move south to the border city of Rafah or to a coastal area in the southwest. “Khan Younis city is a dangerous combat zone,” the leaflets read.But Halima Abdel-Rahman, a widow and mother of four, said she won’t heed such orders anymore. She fled her home in October to an area outside Khan Younis, where she stays with relatives.“The occupation tells you to go to this area, then they bomb it,” she said by phone. ""The reality is that no place is safe in Gaza. They kill people in the north. They kill people in the south.”The United States, Israel’s closest ally, has urged Israel to avoid significant new mass displacement and do more to protect civilians. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris also told Egypt's president that “under no circumstances” would the U.S. permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, an ongoing siege of Gaza or the redrawing of its borders.On the ground in Gaza, there was frustration and mourning. Outside a Gaza City hospital, a dust-covered boy named Saaed Khalid Shehta dropped to his knees beside the bloodied body of his little brother Mohammad, one of several bodies laid out after people said their street was hit by airstrikes. He kissed him.“You bury me with him!” the boy cried. A health worker at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital said more than 15 children were killed.Israel's military said its fighter jets and helicopters struck targets in the Gaza Strip including “tunnel shafts, command centers and weapons storage facilities,"" while a drone killed five Hamas fighters. Military officials acknowledged ”extensive aerial attacks in the Khan Younis area.""The bodies of 31 people killed in Israeli bombardment of central Gaza were taken to the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, said Omar al-Darawi, a hospital administrative employee. One woman wept, cradling a child’s body on her lap. Another carried the body of a baby. Later, hospital workers reported 11 more dead after another airstrike. The bloodied survivors included a child carried in on a mattress.Outside a morgue in Khan Younis, resident Samy al-Najeila carried the body of a child. He said his sons had been preparing to evacuate their home, “but the occupation didn’t give us any time. The three-floor building was destroyed completely, the whole block was totally destroyed.” He said six of the bodies were his relatives.“Five people are still under the rubble,” he said. “God help us.”During a short trip to the United Arab Emirates as the top American representative at the U.N. climate conference, Harris said: ""Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating.”Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel was making “maximum effort” to protect civilians. In addition to the leaflets, the military has used phone calls and radio and TV broadcasts to urge Gazans to move from specific areas.Israel says it targets Hamas operatives and blames civilian casualties on the militants, accusing them of operating in residential neighborhoods. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Israel says at least 78 of its soldiers have been killed in the offensive in northern Gaza.The renewed hostilities have heightened concerns for the 137 hostages who the Israeli military believes are still being held by Hamas. During the recent truce, 105 hostages were freed, and Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners. Most of those released by both sides were women and children.The families of hostages have called for an urgent meeting with Israel's Security Cabinet, saying time is “running out to save those still held by Hamas.”Elsewhere in the region, Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it struck Israeli positions near the tense Lebanon-Israel border. Eleven people — eight soldiers and three civilians — were wounded by Hezbollah fire in the area of Beit Hillel, army radio reported. The military said its artillery struck sources of fire from Lebanon. It also said its fighter jets struck other Hezbollah targets.And Iraqi militants with the Iran-backed umbrella group the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said they struck the Kharab al-Jir U.S. military base in Syria with rockets. A U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said rockets hit Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria but there were no reports of casualties or damage.___",7305,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israel-widens-evacuation-orders-shifts-offensive-southern-gaza-105337989,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c62c5bd5-9986-4776-a096-efe7e1451601/wirestory_1b93089ec82d10ce89df802d51acc108_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,power wider bury rebel drone widow helicopter hamdan prime crammed human gazans place residential safe cabinet protect weeklong hard source jet building vice nbc ashraf boy stay hundred houthi held urgent syria struck specific differentiate climate imprison sunday concern heavy truce hezbollah omar expand warship casualty save volker cradle ministry central broadcast laid intensified israeli family khan airstrikes assert adviser coastal umbrella innocent believe image health hostage city woman tie türk dead navy toll bloody command communication condition estimate acknowledge friday combat morgue senior renew give zone anymore offensive early brother fading follow meeting heighten meet mass blame fire hillel civilian saaed official harris operative recent drop ally foreign evacuation significant dangerous american expire claim center resumption minister surpass part crowd completely suffer kamala bank administrative group conference base mohammad anonymity vowed death osama cry frankly flee shaft security palestinian rumalyn street combatant home deir neighborhood extensive territory release rubble tense gaza baptist operating destroyed facility arab move fighter younis tv land resume prisoner army yemen work reality carry body order nation council weapon line representative addition roughly trip hospital israel halima region southwest earlier evacuate baby knee militant iraqi soldier short relocation siege operation include aerial talk circumstance nearby south strength lebanon child effort conflict employee kill airstrike strip described shehta top million wound samy hamas benjamin west red call mother beit exchange storage permanent ongoing negotiator director border resident widen told chief resistance continue national goal leaflet ground khalid president majority leave phone evidence position claimed john spokesman press day temporary speak thousand side islamic egypt military house freed block force prepare scale frustration accuse northern remove avoid rocket radio bombardment united achieve displacement rafah victim totally facilitate kharab toma redrawing permit agency occupation maximum dozen october tunnel regev regulation wept run attack refugee artillery worker area video time hostility kirby provide iraq closest emirate pentagon hit mourn displace survivor eleven multiple god urge link southern commercial spark kiss fear netanyahu make report heed juliette target mark bomb north state ship,-0.9969,0.5338809034907598,10.364921230307576,0.3097461097461098,0,2023-12-03
NPR,"Police in Paris have arrested a man who targeted passersby, killing 1 and injuring 2",2023-12-03 02:49:00,The Associated Press,"PARIS â€” French police arrested a man who targeted passersby in Paris on Saturday night, killing a German tourist with a knife and injuring two others, France's interior minister said. Police subdued the man, a 25-year-old French citizen who had spent four years in prison for planning a violent offense. After his arrest, he expressed anguish about Muslims dying, notably in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories, and claimed that France was an accomplice, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. The attacker apparently cried ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great), Darmanin added. ""This person was ready to kill others,"" Darmanin told reporters. The anti-terrorism prosecutor's office confirmed it has opened an investigation. The attacker went after a German couple with a knife, killing the man and used a hammer to injure two others. The attacker, who was not identified by name, left prison after four years in 2020 and was under surveillance and undergoing psychiatric treatment, the minister said, painting a brief portrait of the assailant, who was born in Neuilly-Sur-Seine, a Paris suburb. He was most recently living with his parents in the Essonne region, south of Paris. The fatal attack occurred in the 15th district of the French capital with the assailant using a knife to kill the German tourist, who was not identified. He then crossed the Seine river to the Right Bank and used a hammer to attack the injured. Details about the victims were not immediately known. The attacker was stopped by police who twice fired a taser at him in the stomach, the minister said, praising the officers for their quick response and reiterating that ""there would doubtless have been other dead."" France has been under a heightened terror alert since the fatal stabbing in October of a teacher in the northern city of Arras by a former student originally from the Ingushetia region in Russia's Caucasus Mountains and suspected of Islamic radicalization. That fatal attack came three years after another teacher was killed outside Paris, beheaded by a radicalized Chechen later killed by police. The Saturday attack raised the fear level in the French capital, still marked by the 2015 attacks of cafes and a music hall by Islamist radicals that killed 130 people.

ABC,"1 dead in strong quake that sparked tsunami warning, widespread panic in Philippines",2023-12-03 02:09:00,JIM GOMEZ Associated Press,"MANILA, Philippines -- A powerful earthquake that shook the southern Philippines killed at least one villager and injured several others as thousands scrambled out of their homes in panic and jammed roads to higher grounds after a tsunami warning was issued, officials said Sunday.The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the quake Saturday night had a magnitude of 7.6 and struck at a depth of 32 kilometers (20 miles). The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said it expected tsunami waves to hit the southern Philippines and parts of Indonesia, Palau and Malaysia, but later dropped its tsunami warning.The USGS recorded a further earthquake Sunday with a magnitude of 6.6, east of the municipality of Hinuatan and at a depth of 56 kilometers (34 miles), but there was no tsunami alert. The Philippine seismological agency described it as an aftershock.In Japan, authorities issued evacuation orders late Saturday in various parts of Okinawa prefecture, including for the entire coastal area, affecting thousands of people.A pregnant woman died after she, her husband and daughter were hit by a 15-feet (4.5-meter) concrete wall that collapsed in their neighborhood as the ground shook and prompted them to flee from their house in Tagum city in Davao del Norte province, the city’s disaster-mitigation chief, Shieldon Isidoro, told The Associated Press.Her husband and daughter were injured. Two other children and their parents jumped from a second-floor window in panic as their house swayed but were not injured after landing on a grassy lot, said Isidoro, who was at his home when the ground started to shake.""Initially the swaying was weak. Then it quickly became stronger and I could hardly stand. My perfume bottles fell off a table, pictures on my wall swung and I heard people screaming outside: 'Get out, get out, earthquake, earthquake!”’ Isidoro said.While he feared the roof of his house would collapse on him, Isidoro said he was more worried that there could be many casualties in Tagum, a city of about 300,000 people, where he had led regular earthquake drills that he thought helped prevent more deaths and injuries.Hundreds of patients were evacuated from a Tagum hospital but later were escorted back after an inspection showed no major damage to the building, officials said.Thousands of residents stayed outside their homes for hours in many towns due to the earthquake and tsunami scare, including in some that were drenched by an overnight downpour, officials said.Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr told a news conference that authorities were assessing the quake’s impact but initial reports indicated there were no major damages except for two damaged bridges and pockets of power outages. One death was reported with a few injuries, he said.Teresito Bacolcol, the head of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, told The AP shortly after the quake hit that his agency advised residents along the coast of Surigao del Sur and Davao Oriental provinces, which were near the epicenter of the undersea quake, to immediately evacuate to higher ground or move farther inland.Pictures posted on the Facebook account of Hinatuan town in Surigao del Sur province show residents fleeing to higher ground on foot or aboard cars, trucks, motorcycles and tricycle taxis overnight.Many villagers who fled to evacuation centers returned to their homes on Sunday, officials said.After undertaking inspections, civil aviation officials said there was no major damage in several airports in the south and there was no disruption in flights operations.The Philippines, one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, is often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of seismic faults around the ocean. The archipelago is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year.___",3866,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/strong-earthquake-sparked-tsunami-warning-leaves-1-dead-105337884,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/167a28a5-eab1-4e84-94e3-6df69725d424/wirestory_cf74e4071a06f8257e6509602d19bc15_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,typhoon power scream advise drench prevent powerful fault night car undertaking scramble drill building start motorcycle volcanology truck taxi stand parent depth bottle struck ocean sunday seismology casualty epicenter mile alert picture coastal japan swayed injured shieldon wave impact fell bridge jr city woman palau ring quickly institute initially teodoro pacific pregnant coast magnitude geological regular surigao fire window back official shortly facebook drop seismological weak evacuation davao hinatuan country aboard seismic indicate center part volcanic initial province conference death downpour flee record home strong airport malaysia shake prefecture foot issue neighborhood grassy patient table lash account shook expect due municipality concrete disruption storm move land quake overnight order entire hospital panic farther evacuate include post escort south civil indonesia high major assess child sway arc kill described outage hour worried husband scare news injury lead resident told chief pocket ground inspection roof earthquake location lot world perfume thousand authority affect warn flight house secretary collapse east wall tagum bacolcol villager associate immediately head manila jammed hinuatan agency undersea area return damage survey swung heard gilberto archipelago oriental jumped isidoro kilometer tsunami hit okinawa show stayed philippine usgs late eruption southern prompt daughter tricycle aviation fear road saturday report town norte,-0.9952,0.4655975168132437,12.036283185840706,0.3362179487179487,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,"Blast that killed 4 at university was terrorism, Philippine president says",2023-12-03 01:28:00,Regine Cabato,"MANILA — An explosion in the southern Philippines that killed at least four people Sunday was “perpetrated by foreign terrorists,” according to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.The blast took place during a Catholic mass held inside a gymnasium at Mindanao State University in the majority-Muslim city of Marawi, some 500 miles south of Manila.Marcos condemned “the senseless and most heinous acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists” in a statement on social media. “Extremists who wield violence against the innocent will always be regarded as enemies to our society,” he said.The island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines, which includes a Muslim-majority autonomous region, has historically been wracked with armed conflict, and insurgent groups remain active in some areas.On Sunday, photos and videos of the scene showed bodies and plastic chairs strewn across the gym floor. Survivors emerged with scrapes and blood-soaked clothes.In a Facebook group for the university community, users expressed solidarity, but also fear. “To our Christian sisters, if you go out later … wear a hijab,” one comment with over 40 reactions read. “We just want to ensure you are safe.”Mamintal Alonto Adiong Jr., governor of Lanao del Sur in Mindanao, said the province upholds “basic human rights, and that includes the right to religion.”Diplomats from the United States, Canada, Britain and the European Union condemned the attack. “I extend deepest condolences on the part of the U.S. government,” U.S. ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson said on social media.The university has suspended classes until further notice. “We stand in solidarity with our Christian community and all those affected by this tragedy,” it said in a statement.An initial investigation found “the bomb signature is probably from Daula Islamiyah Maute Group,” said Philippine army spokesman Louie Dema-ala, but authorities were reviewing other possibilities.The Maute group — which is affiliated with the Islamic State terrorist organization — is among the militant groups that besieged Marawi City for five months in 2017.

ABC,"Militants open fire at a bus in northern Pakistan, killing 9, including 2 soldiers",2023-12-03 01:18:00,The Associated Press,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Militants opened fire at a bus in northern Pakistan, killing nine people including two soldiers, and injuring over 20 others, local police said.The attack happened Saturday night on the Karakoram Highway in the northern Gilgit Baltistan region, police officer Azmat Shah said. The highway connects Pakistan with China and also passes through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which has been a hotbed of terrorism in the past due to the presence of the Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups in the area.The bus was carrying passengers from Gilgit to the city of Rawalpindi when it was shot at, causing the driver to lose control and crash into a truck, which in turn caught fire. Both drivers were killed on site.At least 26 people were injured — including a local cleric — and transferred to hospitals. Police helped reroute traffic in the area after condoning off the site, officials said.The interior minister of Gilgit Baltistan, Shams Lone, called the incident an “act of terrorism.”Pakistan’s interim Prime Minister, Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar condemned the attack, saying that “anti-state elements would not be allowed to sabotage the peace of Gilgit Baltistan,” and vowed to continue fighting “against terrorists.”A special investigation team has been formed to look into the attack and apprehend those behind it, according to the chief minister of Gilgit Baltistan, Gulbar Khan.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.In a statement Sunday, Muhammad Khorasani, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, also known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, denied his group was behind the shooting.",1635,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/militants-open-fire-bus-northern-pakistan-killing-9-105337536,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,interim due local site apprehend lose pass shah interior police prime carry element sabotage hospital passenger region night baltistan militant soldier traffic gulbar include truck peace pakhtunkhwa accord china kill form caught condone sunday taliban happen call terrorism investigation hotbed responsibility presence pakistani cleric chief continue azmat injure injured khorasani claimed spokesman bus crash ttp muhammad city officer connects shot northern khyber sham driver incident act immediately karakoram peshawar pakistan shoot statement fire control gilgit official condemn lone attack area team past minister kakar fight province special group turn deny vowed open transfer reroute saturday rawalpindi highway,-0.98755,0.3669724770642201,12.12209059233449,0.3371428571428571,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Indian premier Narendra Modi's party set for victory in 3 states ahead of 2024 national vote,2023-12-03 01:07:00,The Associated Press,"NEW DELHI -- India’s Hindu nationalist party was headed for a clear win in three out of four state elections Sunday, according to the election commission’s website. The crucial poll has pitted India’s opposition against the ruling party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of next year’s vital national vote.Ballot counting showed Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, was poised to wrest control of the states of Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan from the Indian National Congress, India’s main opposition party. The BJP was also likely to be re-elected in Madhya Pradesh for a record fifth term.The Congress was comfortably leading in Telangana state which is ruled by the strong Telangana Rashtra Samithi, known for opposing BJP in the state.Final results are expected later Sunday.Vote counting in a fifth state, Mizoram, is set for Monday where BJP’s regional ally, the Mizo National Front, is in power.Elections in the five states were held last month and more than 160 million people, or a sixth of India’s electorate, were eligible to vote. Polling in India is generally done in phases owing to the large population.Modi thanked voters for “their unwavering support” in the states where his party was leading.“The results in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan indicate that the people of India are firmly with politics of good governance and development, which the @BJP4India stands for,” Modi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leader, conceded defeat in the three states where his party was trailing. “The battle of ideology will continue,” he wrote on X, and thanked the people of Telangana where his party was winning.BJP workers celebrated their party’s certain win across the country. In some places they danced wearing Modi masks, distributed sweets and smeared colors on each others' faces as mark of jubilations.At the party headquarters in New Delhi on Sunday evening, the BJP activists lined up on the two sides and Modi walked between them, waving. The activists showered him with flower petals, chanting “Long live Mother India” and other slogans.Later, Modi in a speech said the results were “historic and unprecedented” and “a victory for honesty, transparency and good governance.”Modi and his party remain popular on a national level after nearly a decade in power and surveys suggest he will win a third consecutive term in 2024. But a new alliance of 28 opposition parties, called INDIA, is expected to challenge Modi’s party nationally. The acronym, which stands for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, comprises India’s previously fractured opposition parties and is led by the Congress party.Both the Indian premier and the Congress leader Gandhi flew across the five states to woo voters before the election. The charged-up voting campaigns witnessed both leaders promising voters subsidies, loan waivers and employment guarantees.Modi will seek reelection next year at a time when India’s global diplomatic reach is rising. But in recent polls, Congress has dented his party’s image of invincibility by toppling local BJP governments in state elections in southern Karnataka and northern Himachal Pradesh.",3185,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/vote-count-begins-4-indian-states-pitting-opposition-105337443,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/99df9d08-37fd-4afb-912f-42f8863ccc3d/wirestory_1044810ef17acc38c7511c8b6a783eb4_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,firmly expect power chant local generally bjp headquarters karnataka shower flew modi result prime suggest voting indian telangana poll dent place line nationalist eligible unwavering popular transparency inclusive crucial website comfortably voter counting premier india alliance development stand accord topple consecutive held speech witness smear madhya bharatiya rule million sunday promising developmental samithi call set mother celebrate honesty reach petal level polling formerly lead owe gandhi sixth national concede continue comprises unprecedented term loan janata dance distribute image walk wave battle government mizoram pit party mizo side month commission decade ruling year acronym congress fracture historic win politics northern poise challenge seek himachal write x flower thanked delhi rashtra head phase live control ideology trail nationally rajasthan support front recent ally remain ahead wrest worker monday wear survey country previously narendra indicate activist time minister defeat election subsidy reelection waiver governance color invincibility global long pradesh regional chhattisgarh show vote hindu rise vital mask oppose southern record campaign strong sweet large diplomatic employment mark victory opposition clear electorate leader woo state,0.9902,0.0941915227629513,10.797663230240545,0.4005230880230881,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,"In second act, Russian activist group Pussy Riot protests Ukraine war",2023-12-03 01:00:00,Robyn Dixon,"RIGA, Latvia — More than a year after members of the Russian activist group Pussy Riot, Maria Alyokhina and Lucy Shtein escaped from Moscow disguised as food couriers, the feminist punk-protest band is touring the United States with a new antiwar anthem that howls in rage at Kremlin propagandists they accuse of poisoning Russian minds.The group borrows from Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake — music wedded in Russian minds as synonymous with sinister official censorship — for their song about the poison of state television in a nation where, according to the lyrics, “the happiness of the Motherland is more precious than life.”Alyokhina was imprisoned in 2012 with two other Pussy Riot members for nearly two years for “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” over a punk performance that year in Moscow’s Christ the Savior Cathedral. She was arrested again in January 2021 for organizing protests over the jailing of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.For months, Alyokhina faced a string of trumped-up charges, such as spreading “Nazi propaganda” or “inciting hatred.” She was repeatedly placed in detention — often rearrested as she walked out of the prison gate — or sentenced to house arrest with a police car constantly watching the Moscow apartment she was sharing with Shtein, who is her girlfriend.In a carefully planned spring 2022 escape, Shtein left their apartment disguised in a green food courier outfit and fled Russia via Belarus. Weeks later, Alyokhina escaped Russia in the same disguise.“There were no scary moments,” Alyokhina said in a phone interview after one of the group’s performances. She was beaten by Cossack militias in 2014 in Sochi with other members of the group and has been arrested so many times that she has learned to tamp down her fear — a trait she jokingly calls a “deformation.”In their first North American tour since the escape, Pussy Riot is protesting the horrors of what they call President Vladimir Putin’s “fascist” regime to a U.S. audience that appears increasingly divided over support to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion.Pussy Riot’s “Swan Lake” weaves a tale of the ominous social themes unfolding in Russia against the background of the war — the appalling casualty rates, the demands from Russian politicians that women stay home and give birth to many children, the jailing of antiwar protesters, and the increasing militarization of education.The lyrics run:The value of life is overestimatedWomen should give birth moreDon’t spare the soldiersOur women will have more babiesThey don’t consider us as people here.In a video for the song, the group in virginal white cotton dresses walk barefoot in an agricultural field outside a wooden cottage. Inside, a small boy plays with toy soldiers in front of a television set, and suddenly finds his hands covered in blood.War is a celebration, everything is fine.Pussy Riot collaborated on the video with artists still in Russia, including Alisa Gorshenina, of Nizhny Tagil, a city in the Urals, who works in textiles and other media.“We use the Swan Lake theme because that theme was used during the Soviet Union to censor news,” Alyokhina said.It was played on state television when Soviet leaders died and during the 1991 coup against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The new song was authored by Alyokhina, Shtein, Olga Borisova and Diana Burkot.“The whole song is our protest against Russian propaganda,” Alyokhina said. “Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, they started to brainwash children with new patriotic lessons that they created. They forced children to learn the so-called new history of Russia.”Pussy Riot operates as a creative activist collective with shifting participation in performances and actions. They stage protests, perform in different groupings, stage exhibitions, give speeches, write books and release political songs.Alyokhina’s 2017 memoir, “Riot Days,” tells of her activism and time in prison and her insistence on her dignity — defying prison warders who ordered her to strip. She is writing a new book, to publish next year.The group’s tour performance, also called Riot Days, is a mix of music, performance and protest designed to tell audiences “who Vladimir Putin is and what they are going to do. The main goal of this regime is to rebuild the dead body of Soviet Union with tanks, rockets, the army, whatever they have,” Alyokhina said.Pussy Riot performed in Washington on Saturday and will appear in other eastern coast cities this week.They were spurred to write Swan Lake because of an incident at school No. 22 in the city of Yekaterinburg in September 2022 when teachers ordered children to write supportive letters to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine.A fifth-grader named Timofei wrote a letter begging the recipient not to kill anyone, according to local media channel It’s My City, and was reproached by his teacher for sending the wrong message.Another incident that inspired the song involved 12-year-old Masha Moskalyova, who was reported to the police by her school and placed in an orphanage after she drew an antiwar picture protesting the war.Her single father, Alexei Moskalyov was sentenced to two years in jail over online comments about the war. His daughter is now living with her mother, who had been estranged.Pussy Riot’s 2012 cathedral protest song “A Punk Prayer,” won little support from Russians, 42 percent of whom saw it as an attack on the Russian Orthodox Church. A poll by Levada Center independent polling group at the time found that only 6 percent of Russians sympathized with the group.That song evoked the gilded corruption of the church in toxic symbiosis with Putin, “the KGB’s chief saint,” descending to choke freedom, chain LGBTQ+ people, and send “punks to prison vans.”Eleven years later, as the Kremlin presses forward with a regressive “traditional” Orthodox agenda, banning the “international LGBT public movement” as “extremist,” restricting abortion, banning transgender people from transitioning, and pursuing a messianic war against Ukraine, the cathedral protest now seems a prophetic warning.Still, public support for the war remains high, thanks to state propaganda.Alyokhina was alone in a prison cell on Feb. 24, 2022 when she heard on the radio that Russia had invaded Ukraine.“It’s useless to scream when you’re alone, but I wanted to scream,” she said. “But instead of screaming, I just started writing. I wanted to just write everything I felt.”Working feverishly to continue her protest action outside of Russia, she feels torn from her country, although there is no way back as long as Putin remains in power.",6658,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/03/russia-pussy-riot-ukraine-war/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,protest traditional power local repeatedly propagandist white propaganda synonymous scream member descend instead dress online poll place played jailing demand overestimatedwomen car rearrested spring abortion start design forward remains shift boy stay christ celebration virginal coup constantly tank imprison hooliganism learn freedom tchaikovsky mind russian lucy september set censor kgb appal ukraine found casualty beaten comment barefoot moskalyova nizhny moment belarus riot picture alyokhina artist eastern union lyric send walk choke gorshenina disguise rage create city washington woman diana weave detention involve levada charge dead left happiness antiwar organize feel food regressive brainwash hatred exhibition arrest perform cottage give audience small write value coast trait drew social grouping scary punk defend warder prayer back tagil official front recipient cover evoke theme pursue american transition censorship feminist country motherland prison center activist riga independent percent publish fight lesson group vladimir courier green movement outfit flee jokingly insistence feverishly living political rate home unfold field swan religious birth release incite leader howl prophetic supportive watch moredon sentence corruption medium plan collaborate single find tamp police alisa letter regime dignity agricultural wooden army moscow work cotton militarization body nation order torn book orphanage precious chain soldier sympathize gorbachev public hand band include ominous wrong moskalyov textile high nazi play restrict child accord speech spur action orthodox kill invasion strip mikhail interview father january author suddenly wed call mother russia savior polling television gate mix news alexei rebuild escape defy background international chief gild continue goal masha president horror inspire inside messianic song phone tour increase divide yekaterinburg press week beg day kremlin soviet creative putin church sochi month share increasingly ban cossack life consider year house force useless invade accuse stage poison participation borisova rocket radio maria apartment united extremist borrows incident channel spare string begin motivate agenda different collective support fascist carefully run soldiersour school attack protester saint militia heard video lake teacher time toxic cell jail lgbt reproach long timofei symbiosis toy eleven operates olga spread anthem music daughter history shtein fear urals memoir pussy patriotic saturday report transgender cathedral activism north performance politician opposition sinister latvia babiesthey state,-0.99495,0.135175728446981,10.640619396903013,0.3245737734487735,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Chinese developer Evergrande risking liquidation if creditors veto its plan for handling huge debts,2023-12-03 00:06:00,ZEN SOO AP business writer,"HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong court will convene a hearing Monday on troubled Chinese property developer Evergrande’s plans for restructuring its more than $300 billion in debts and staving off liquidation.The company, the world’s most indebted property developer, ran into trouble when Chinese regulators cracked down on excessive borrowing in the real estate sector.Last month, the company said Chinese police were investigating Evergrande’s chairman, Hui Ka Yan, for unspecified suspected crimes in the latest obstacle to the company's efforts to resolve its financial woes.The Hong Kong High Court has postponed the hearing over Evergrande’s potential liquidation several times. Judge Linda Chan said in October that Monday’s hearing would be the last before a decision is handed down.Evergrande could be ordered to liquidate if the plan is rejected by its creditors.In September, Evergrande abandoned its initial debt restructuring plan after authorities banned it from issuing new dollar bonds, which was a key part of its plan.The company first defaulted on its financial obligations in 2021, just over a year after Beijing clamped down on lending to property developers in an effort to cool a property bubble.Evergrande is one of the biggest developers to have defaulted on its debts. But others including Country Garden, China's largest real estate developer, have also run into trouble, their predicaments rippling through financial systems in and outside China.The fallout from the property crisis has also affected China’s shadow banking industry — institutions which provide financial services similar to banks but which operate outside of banking regulations.Police are investigating Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, a major shadow bank in China that has lent billions in yuan (dollars) to property developers, after it said it was insolvent with up to $64 billion in liabilities.Real estate drove China’s economic boom, but developers borrowed heavily as they turned cities into forests of apartment and office towers. That has helped to push total corporate, government and household debt to the equivalent of more than 300% of annual economic output, unusually high for a middle-income country.",2200,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chinese-developer-evergrande-risking-liquidation-creditors-veto-plan-105336787,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5b44ea4c-43e1-46a7-b978-b851dc6d99ea/wirestory_e83225b9a7856dd7015e7e1a527fc4d8_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,estate hong insolvent plan shadow police default order cool beijing similar total economic service hand include enterprise high crime major bond effort china office linda system resolve troubled operate september ripple heavily stave evergrande chairman predicament zhongzhi indebted key property unspecified corporate reject big crack world obligation government authority convene month billion ban real industry boom city developer dollar household year push drove forest output restructuring banking institution unusually investigate apartment obstacle equivalent chinese tower excessive borrowing annual october liquidate run lent lending monday yuan decision country yan time court hearing liquidation chan part garden crisis provide debt regulator initial suspect trouble fallout affected bank group turn ran late potential kong financial abandon borrow large issue judge company clamped postpone,-0.97245,0.409090909090909,13.25197860962567,0.347692716640085,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Kissinger's unwavering support for brutal regimes still haunts Latin America,2023-12-03 00:02:00,DANIEL POLITI Associated Press and PATRICIA LUNA Associated Press,"SANTIAGO, Chile -- In Chile, leftists were tortured, tossed from helicopters and forced to watch relatives be raped. In Argentina, many were “disappeared” by members of the brutal military dictatorship that held detainees in concentration camps.It all happened with the endorsement of Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. secretary of state who died Wednesday at age 100.As tributes poured in for the towering figure who was the top U.S. diplomat under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, the mood was decidedly different in South America, where many countries were scarred deeply during the Cold War by human rights abuses inflicted in the name of anti-communism and where many continue to harbor a deep distrust of their powerful neighbor to the north.“I don’t know of any U.S. citizen who is more deplored, more disliked in Latin America than Henry Kissinger,” said Stephen Rabe, a retired University of Texas at Dallas history professor who wrote a book about Kissinger’s relationship with Latin America. “You know, the reality is, if he had traveled once democracy returned to Argentina, to Brazil, to Uruguay — if he had traveled to any of those countries he would have been immediately arrested.”There is likely no starker example of Kissinger’s meddling with democracy in the region and then supporting brutality in the name of anti-communism than Chile.In Chile, Kissinger played a key role in the efforts to do everything in the United States' power to undermine and weaken the socialist government of Salvador Allende, who was elected president in 1970. Kissinger then used his sway to prop up the military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who rose to power in a 1973 coup, repeatedly refusing to call attention to the numerous human rights violations of Pinochet's regime, which murdered opponents, canceled elections, restricted the media, suppressed labor unions and disbanded political parties.Kissinger long alleged that he wasn’t aware of the human rights abuses that were committed in the region, but records show that this wasn’t the case, said Peter Kornbluh, a senior analyst at the National Security Archive that is in charge of its Chile project.“The declassified historical record, the documents that Kissinger wrote, read and said, leave no doubt that he was the chief architect of the U.S. policy to destabilize the Allende government and that he was also the chief enabler of helping the Pinochet regime consolidate what became a bloody, 17-year infamous dictatorship,” Kornbluh said.Kissinger was “somewhat obsessed” with Allende’s government, fearing that the rise of a socialist government through democratic means could have a contagion effect in the region, said Chilean Sen. José Miguel Insulza, a former secretary general of the Organization of American States who served as a foreign policy adviser in Allende’s government.“For him, any action that meant defending the national interest of the United States seemed justifiable,” Insulza said.Kissinger feared what Allende’s government could mean for the world.“In geopolitical terms, Kissinger considered the rise of a left-wing coalition to power through democratic means even more dangerous than the example set by Cuba. Indeed, this could be replicated in Western countries with powerful communist parties in terms of electoral influence, such as in Italy,” said Rolando Álvarez, a history professor at the University of Santiago, Chile.Kissinger was seemingly unaffected by tales of suffering at the hands of military officers, even though his own family arrived in the U.S. as refugees who had to flee Nazi Germany in his teens.“By the end of 1976, State Department aides were telling Henry Kissinger, a Jew, that Jews were being targeted in Argentina,” Rabe said. “And Kissinger just didn’t do anything.”In Chile’s neighbor, Argentina, a military junta rose to power in 1976 vowing to combat leftist “subversives."" Kissinger made clear he had no objections to their brutal tactics and repeatedly ignored calls from other State Department officials to raise more concerns about human rights violations.In a June 1976 meeting, Kissinger had a message for Argentina's foreign minister, Admiral César Augusto Guzzetti: “If there are things that have to be done, you should do them quickly.” He later reiterated that support during a meeting in October 1976 — a time when Argentine officials were worried the U.S. would raise human rights concerns amid increasing reports of torture and disappearances.Guzzetti was “overjoyed” at the meetings, and “had felt that Kissinger had given him the signal that the United States had no objection to wholesale slaughter,” Rabe said.Kissinger had a similar attitude toward other military dictatorships in the region, including in Uruguay and Brazil, and never raised objections to what was known as Operation Condor, a clandestine program that allowed military regimes in that part of the world to illegally pursue, detain, torture and assassinate political dissidents who fled their countries.That attitude made a lasting imprint on Latin Americans’ psyche.“At least here in Latin America, what I perceived in Henry Kissinger’s vision is very negative because it’s a kind of anything goes mentality. No matter how brutal the dictatorship is that must be supported, it doesn’t matter,” said Francisco Bustos, a human rights lawyer and professor at the University of Chile.Decades later, the effects of that policy are still being felt in a region that feels the U.S. would go to any lengths to support its interests.“There is a segment of political parties and movements in Latin America, including Chile, where the relationship with the United States is essentially marked by anti-imperialism. This perspective essentially sees any U.S. administration, whether Democratic or Republican, liberal, progressive, or ultraconservative, as more or less the same,” said Gilberto Aranda, an international relations professor at the University of Chile.Although U.S. intervention in a region that was often referred to as “America’s backyard” has a long history, Kissinger seemed to take that into overdrive.It’s no surprise then that one of the harshest reactions to Kissinger’s death came from a Chilean official.“A man has died whose historical brilliance never managed to conceal his profound moral misery,” Chile’s ambassador to the United States, Juan Gabriel Valdes, posted on the social media platform X. Chile’s leftist President Gabriel Boric then retweeted the message.___",6509,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/kissingers-unwavering-support-brutal-regimes-haunts-latin-america-105336783,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f540a35c-d504-4649-9dc0-599647f0923f/wirestory_4780b50a4cc7f865b9771c1ab25a7187_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,meant power gerald repeatedly member argentine administration helicopter chile augusto coalition admiral human dallas democratic powerful played historical harshest brutality analyst mood seemingly insulza ford disliked aware former richard held bustos coup destabilize concern vision happen policy set attention doubt weaken negative family retire adviser mentality profound union perceive segment cancel government cold subversive charge bloody rolando numerous nixon feel university officer combat guzzetti wednesday senior give contagion write arrive social henry chilean felt signal meeting serve defend tower liberal clandestine jew program official gabriel matter electoral geopolitical foreign objection pursue dictatorship opponent dangerous american attitude country minister part amid election disband kind obsess imprint salvador suffer refer message movement deeply toss department death flee security marked record state political inflict kornbluh progressive miguel kissinger deep watch elect influence medium raise ambassador regime josé reality surprise similar book manage region platform detain tribute operation hand include argentina leftist stephen post south commit scar pinochet western nazi restrict sway effort action unaffected top backyard uruguay general effect undermine perspective starker diplomat call allege worried slaughter communist assassinate murder concentration brutal relation international key chief dissident continue national rap harbor neighbor term boric reiterate president cuba leave francisco case brilliance refuse misery increase juan replicate world age party socialist military álvarez allende read consider texas force violation secretary citizen endorsement republican wholesale ultraconservative united rabe italy ignore immediately america valdes deplore archive infamous suppress vow consolidate different intervention length support figure architect germany illegally relationship condor october retweeted refugee meddling democracy overjoyed return relative gilberto essentially time enabler tactic lawyer torture distrust long prop interest show role santiago césar declassify june professor rise latin labor aranda travel reaction conceal aide indeed fear make report organization junta brazil target abuse decidedly clear justifiable detainee history document disappear,-0.9939,0.3687202335228145,11.549982964224874,0.409513888888889,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Venezuelans vote in a referendum to claim sovereignty of a large territory under dispute with Guyana,2023-12-03 00:01:00,REGINA GARCIA CANO Associated Press and JORGE RUEDA Associated Press,"CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuelans are voting in a referendum Sunday called by the government of President Nicolás Maduro to claim sovereignty over a large swath of neighboring Guyana, arguing the oil- and mineral-rich territory was stolen when the border was drawn more than a century ago.Guyana considers the referendum a step toward annexation, and the vote has its residents on edge. It asks Venezuelans whether they support establishing a state in the disputed territory, known as Essequibo, granting citizenship to current and future area residents and rejecting the jurisdiction of the United Nations' top court in settling the disagreement between the two South American countries.“We are solving through constitutional, peaceful and democratic means an imperial dispossession of 150 years,” President Nicolás Maduro said after voting in a military complex in Caracas, the capital. He and other government officials have not explained the exact steps they will take to enforce the referendum's results.The International Court of Justice on Friday ordered Venezuela not to take any action that would alter Guyana’s control over Essequibo, but the judges did not specifically ban officials from carrying out Sunday's five-question referendum. Guyana had asked the court to order Venezuela to halt parts of the vote.Although the practical and legal implications of the referendum remain unclear, in comments explaining Friday's verdict, international court president Joan E. Donoghue said statements from Venezuela's government suggest it “is taking steps with a view toward acquiring control over and administering the territory in dispute.”“Furthermore, Venezuelan military officials announced that Venezuela is taking concrete measures to build an airstrip to serve as a ‘logistical support point for the integral development of the Essequibo,’” she said.The 61,600-square-mile (159,500-square-kilometer) territory accounts for two-thirds of Guyana and also borders Brazil, whose Defense Ministry earlier this week in a statement said it has “intensified its defense actions"" and boosted its military presence in the region as a result of the dispute.Essequibo is larger than Greece and rich in minerals. It also gives access to an area of the Atlantic where energy giant ExxonMobil discovered oil in commercial quantities in 2015, drawing the attention of Maduro's government.Venezuela's government promoted the referendum for weeks, framing participation as an act of patriotism, and often conflating it with a show of support for Maduro. His government held a mock referendum last month, but it did not release participation figures or results.Venezuela has always considered Essequibo as its own because the region was within its boundaries during the Spanish colonial period, and it has long disputed the border decided by international arbitrators in 1899 when Guyana was still a British colony.That boundary was decided by arbitrators from Britain, Russia and the United States. The U.S. represented Venezuela on the panel in part because the Venezuelan government had broken off diplomatic relations with Britain.Venezuelan officials contend that Americans and Europeans conspired to cheat their country out of the land and argue that a 1966 agreement to resolve the dispute effectively nullified the original arbitration.Guyana, the only English-speaking country in South America, maintains the initial accord is legal and binding and asked the International Court of Justice in 2018 to rule it as such, but a ruling is years away.Voters on Sunday will have to answer whether they “agree to reject by all means, in accordance with the law,” the 1899 boundary and whether they support the 1966 agreement “as the only valid legal instrument” to reach a solution.Maduro and his allies are urging voters to answer “yes” to all five questions in the referendum. The referendum was proposed by the country’s National Assembly, approved by the National Electoral Council and cleared by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, all controlled by Maduro loyalists.Maduro has thrown the full weight of his government into the effort, using patriotic rhetoric to try to summon voters to the polls and turning the referendum into the dominant topic across all state-owned media.Essequibo-themed music, nationally televised history lessons, murals, rallies and social media content have helped the government to divert people's attention from pressing matters, including increasing pressure from the U.S. government on Maduro to release political prisoners and wrongfully detained Americans as well as to guarantee free and fair conditions in next year's presidential election.In a tour of Caracas voting centers by The Associated Press, lines of about 30 people could be seen at some of them, while at others, voters did not have to wait at all to cast their ballots. That contrasts with other electoral processes when hundreds of people have gathered outside voting centers from the start.Venezuelans hold as self-evident truth that their homeland’s eastern end includes the Essequibo region. They learn about the territorial dispute from a young age, with textbooks including the historical background and maps marking the territory with diagonal lines.Administrative assistant Henghel Niño, 45, remembers those lessons. Outside a voting center in Caracas, she said she participated in the referendum because Venezuelans “must defend our Essequibo.” But like many other voters, she was not clear about the actions that could result from the referendum's results.“I imagine that (the Guyanese) must be worried about the consequences that this situation may bring, but hey, we have to try to recover our lands because there are many minerals there,” Niño said, adding that she believed Venezuela's government organized the referendum ""to try to recover (Essequibo) legally” in a negotiation with Guyana.“I imagine that the use of weapons would be the last alternative,"" she said.Guyana President Mohamed Irfaan Ali on Sunday acknowledged the apprehension many Guyanese have over the referendum and sought to reassure them, telling them they have “nothing to fear over the next number of hours, days, months ahead.” He said Guyana is using diplomacy as its “first line of defense” and is working continuously to ensure its borders ""remain intact.”“I am not going to get into the internal politics of Venezuela and into their policy making, but I want to advise Venezuela that this is an opportunity for them to show maturity, an opportunity for them to show responsibility, and we call upon them once more join us in ... allowing the rule of law to work and to determine the outcome of this controversy,” Ali said.___",6712,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/venezuelans-vote-referendum-large-swathe-territory-dispute-guyana-105336154,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/21382dd3-8969-4e13-9539-ec265bd0aa7e/wirestory_90a4f0f962a83620903987a68a7d39b0_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,territorial valid advise legal step pressure rich guyana poll donoghue democratic logistical historical televise conspire considers alternative mock voter exact dominant british hundred held period rule sunday boost resolve learn dispossession constitutional policy attention textbook answer comment propose reassure asks original settle divert ministry view build energy intensified conflate justice nicolás free reject eastern full believe diagonal defense government participate determine draw rally assembly henghel disagreement ensure airstrip mineral condition european supreme organize friday acknowledge thrown politics wait recover give peaceful tribunal outcome assistant cheat imagine measure social act unclear rhetoric decide specifically spanish serve announce essequibo defend control nationally official weight matter electoral ally venezuelan wrongfully controversy american access exxonmobil claim country nullified center part remembers map initial lesson boundary vote maturity political integral presidential truth patriotism large niño diplomatic territory imperial judge release account add future practical swath ballot hey concrete medium solve discover continuously land number represent argue result prisoner binding voting suggest work carry citizenship order nation administer gather council weapon line region earlier arbitrator hold halt detain negotiation steal promote summon agreement include britain mohamed guarantee south atlantic joan law development complex accord sovereignty effort action top quantity hour call reach worried russia responsibility presence sought relation border resident annexation background international irfaan implication broken grant national situation neighbor caracas effectively president tour homeland increase press capital week point content day age alter giant verdict month military ban young ruling greece contend consider year establish bring apprehension explain jurisdiction acquire instrument diplomacy guyanese maduro frame approve participation contrast question topic current opportunity united associate america enforce accordance fair panel consequence statement maintains support figure century referendum mural remain area venezuela internal court colonial agree long drawn show turn cast oil process urge edge music dispute commercial fear join patriotic make brazil mark clear legally history state,0.9847,0.0446960667461263,13.065400696864106,0.3257296466973886,0,2023-12-03

Washington Post,Israel’s assault forced a nurse to leave babies behind. They were found decomposing.,2023-12-02 23:02:00,"Miriam Berger, Evan Hill","JERUSALEM — The nurse in the besieged hospital was caring for five fragile babies. Infants, born premature, their parents’ whereabouts after a month of war unknown. Now he faced the most difficult decision of his life.It was the height of Israel’s assault on northern Gaza last month, and al-Nasr Children’s Hospital was a war zone. The day before, airstrikes had cut off the Gaza City facility’s oxygen supplies. Israeli tanks had surrounded the hospital complex, and the Israel Defense Forces were calling and texting the doctors, urging them to leave.But ambulances couldn’t safely reach al-Nasr to transport the wounded, and doctors refused to leave the facility without their patients.The five premature babies were particularly vulnerable. They needed oxygen, and medication administered at regular intervals. There were no portable respirators or incubators to transport them. Without life support, the nurse feared, they wouldn’t survive an evacuation.Then the IDF delivered an ultimatum, al-Nasr director Bakr Qaoud told The Washington Post: Get out or be bombarded. An Israeli official, meanwhile, provided an assurance that ambulances would be arranged to retrieve the patients.The nurse, a Palestinian man who works with Paris-based Doctors Without Borders, saw no choice. He assessed his charges and picked up the strongest one — the baby he thought likeliest to bear a temporary cut to his oxygen supply. He left the other four on their breathing machines, reluctantly, and with his wife, their children and the one baby, headed south.“I felt like I was leaving my own children behind,” said the nurse, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his privacy. “If we had the ability to take them, we would have, [but] if we took them off the oxygen they would have died.”Two weeks later, the pause in hostilities allowed a Gazan journalist to venture into the hospital. In the neonatal intensive care unit, Mohammed Balousha made the awful discovery.The decomposing bodies of the four babies. Eaten by worms. Blackened by mold. Mauled, Balousha said, by stray dogs.“A terrible and horrific scene,” he told The Post. He took video.The grim discovery was a reminder of the harrowing civilian toll of Israel’s war to eradicate Hamas, a campaign that has spared neither hospitals nor children. Thousands have been killed.The current hostilities erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas and allied fighters streamed out of Gaza to attack Israeli communities near the enclave, killed around 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped 240 more. Israel responded with a full siege, airstrikes and ground operations that have killed more than 15,200 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, including thousands of children.Israel has long accused Hamas of hiding command-and-control centers in hospitals; the Biden administration has backed the claim. Hamas and Gaza medical staff deny it.Still, Israeli commanders have made the territory’s health care infrastructure a focus of the military campaign. A month into the war, that included al-Nasr.It was Nov. 10 when Israeli forces told al-Nasr’s staff they had to leave, according to Qaoud, the hospital director. “They sent us a map for a safe route,” he told The Post in a WhatsApp message. “They gave us half an hour to go out. Otherwise, they will bombard the hospital.”An official at the adjacent al-Rantisi pediatric cancer center seemed to receive an assurance that ambulances would retrieve patients from both al-Rantisi and al-Nasr. In a telephone conversation with the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, an arm of Israel’s defense ministry, the al-Rantisi official requested ambulances. In a recording of that call released by the Israel Defense Forces, a senior COGAT officer responds in Arabic: “No problem.”The senior COGAT officer tells the al-Rantisi official that he will “arrange coordination” for ambulances. He gives the precise route that medical staff should take out of the complex.The al-Rantisi official reminds COGAT that staff will also be evacuating al-Nasr. The COGAT officer acknowledges the reminder.Qaoud, too, said there was “coordination with the Red Cross and Israeli army that we will go out and then these cases will be later evacuated to another hospital that was safe.”COGAT spokeswoman Shani Sasson told The Post that Israeli forces neither directed al-Nasr’s staff to evacuate nor operated inside the facility. She declined to answer whether COGAT or the Israeli military had been told about the babies or taken any action to care for them.On Saturday, IDF Spokeswoman Doron Spielman appeared to cast doubt on the story during a live conversation on X, formerly Twitter: “There were no premature babies that decomposed because of the IDF; there were probably no babies that decomposed whatsoever,” he said.Sarah Davies, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Jerusalem, said the agency made no guarantees and could not safely reach the hospital.The evacuation was painful. There was no way to reach the babies’ families, the nurse said. He had no contact information, and communications in much of Gaza were down. Their parents had been “displaced people,” he surmised, “who knew their children were in the hospital and didn’t think the hospital would be hit or raided by the occupation.“They thought they left them in safety.”It was time to leave. The nurse gathered up the strongest baby, made sure the others’ respirators were working, and, still wearing his scrubs, walked with his family out of the hospital to begin the 18-mile journey, much of it on foot, south to Khan Younis.On the road, the nurse found an ambulance to take the baby in his arms to al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest. Israeli forces would raid that facility days later. The World Health Organization eventually evacuated 31 premature babies from al-Shifa. By then, several others had died.On Nov. 24, after nearly seven weeks of fighting, Israel and Hamas began a week-long pause to exchange captives and allow more aid into Gaza.Balousha, a journalist with the Dubai-based Al-Mashhad channel, took advantage of the relative calm to venture into Gaza City and report on corpses left out. On Nabil Tammos Street, he found two bodies, a man and a woman. Someone had covered them in a blanket.“People [were] telling me that the strongest story is found in al-Nasr Hospital,” Balousha said. “They told me that premature babies were left in intensive care and that they were supposed to be rescued,” but with the fighting, “no one took them out.”During the pause, Israeli forces remained near the hospital, cutting off civilian access. Balousha, undeterred, “jumped from wall to wall” through broken buildings to reach the medical complex.As he approached the neonatal intensive care unit, he said, he “started to smell a foul odor.” He turned his camera on.When Al-Mashhad aired the report, it blurred the remains. The channel gave an unaltered copy of the video to The Post, which verified that it was recorded inside al-Nasr’s neonatal intensive care unit by comparing it with images of the facility from before the war.The remains, still hooked up to respirators, bear little resemblance to bodies. They appear as piles of rotting flesh, bones protruding, body parts difficult to make out. Soiled-looking diapers remain wrapped around their middles.Balousha described the scene on camera and hurried out of the unit.The nurse, who reviewed the video, said the corpses were found where he had left the babies. No one had come for them.Qaoud, the al-Nasr director, said the Israeli military “was informed there were cases” left inside the hospital, but “was determined to evacuate.”Davies, the Red Cross spokeswoman, said the organization “received several requests to evacuate hospitals in the north of Gaza, but due to this security situation, we were not involved in any operations of evacuations, nor did teams commit to doing so.”No one has emerged to claim the bodies. There has been no indication, the nurse said, that the parents know their children are dead.He remains haunted by the event. He believes he needs psychiatric treatment.Of what, he asks, were the babies guilty?“Were they fighters?” he asked. “Were they holding weapons? Were they firing rockets?“Why does the army hit the oxygen and electricity? Why did the army target them?”",8360,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/03/gaza-premature-babies-dead-nasr/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I2SUQ3RB7P7RNYEHRVQOFLY23E_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I2SUQ3RB7P7RNYEHRVQOFLY23E_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I2SUQ3RB7P7RNYEHRVQOFLY23E_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I2SUQ3RB7P7RNYEHRVQOFLY23E_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I2SUQ3RB7P7RNYEHRVQOFLY23E_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I2SUQ3RB7P7RNYEHRVQOFLY23E_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,haunt cross scrub emerge infrastructure administration coordination conversation suppose bakr cancer born safe texting fragile protect blacken building start respirator remains venture parent medical jerusalem neonatal tank wrap privacy operate cut protrude doubt answer found asks retrieve activity ministry bear erupt route transport davy hooked israeli family khan airstrikes precise spokeswoman scene full whatsapp particularly believe image walk defense whatsoever health intensive government pause determine hurry city washington woman balousha involve assurance charge toll shani left communication condition difficult assault officer senior give zone eat idf psychiatric x knew unaltered nurse felt biden mold regular painful fire civilian back whereabouts official safely receive infant cover supply doron guilty journey enclave evacuation wear access claim incubator team center diaper part rescue map fight nabil message anonymity cogat security arm record pediatric palestinian street campaign strong unknown raid large aid foot territory patient reminds bombard spar release direct gaza due bone oxygen facility discovery fighter contact inform reminder surmise army work worm half body gather administer weapon pile smell doctor hospital rot israel evacuate baby resemblance hold decline siege operation include electricity review probably arabic guarantee stray post choice south commit height vulnerable complex assess child accord captive action kill indication spoke described blur wound hamas hour acknowledges allied red call responds ambulance reach exchange twitter formerly staff request director wife border told grim international broken eventually situation ground terrible adjacent horrific machine inside picked leave decompose case refuse arrange coordinator week ultimatum harrow world day temporary premature thousand month telephone military air mohammed copy life corps event focus commander respond spielman force story accuse wall northern likeliest interval rocket current survive surround journalist maul calm reluctantly channel unit hiding awful live head begin information support agency attack remain eradicate decision video relative time hostility approach advantage provide jumped verify flesh kidnap breathing hit displace long besiege portable turn cast ability deny medication urge compare community foul undeterred fear qaoud camera stream road saturday report sasson make organization tammos target north gazan deliver committee,-0.99035,0.1435406698564593,9.53191111111111,0.349162624162624,0,2023-12-02
Reuters,"Israel strikes southern Gaza, US VP Harris calls for restraint",2023-12-02 22:49:00,"Mohammad Salem, Nidal Al-Mughrabi","GAZA/CAIRO, Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said too many innocent Palestinians had been killed in Gaza as Israeli war planes and artillery bombarded the enclave on Saturday following the collapse of a truce with Hamas militants.Residents feared the barrages presaged an Israeli ground operation in the south of the Palestinian territory that would pen them into a shrinking area and possibly try to push them across into Egypt.The Gaza health ministry said at least 193 Palestinians had been killed since the truce ended on Friday, adding to the more than 15,000 Palestinian dead since the start of the war. Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas following its Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel in which it says 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage.Speaking in Dubai, Harris said Israel had a right to defend itself, but international and humanitarian law must be respected and ""too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.""""Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering, and the images and videos coming from Gaza, are devastating,"" Harris told reporters.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also weighed in on the need for Israel to protect Gaza civilians as a ""moral responsibility"" even as he said the U.S. would remain its closest friend. ""The center of gravity is the civilian population,"" he said. ""And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was continuing to work in coordination with the U.S. and international organisations to define ""safe areas"" for Gaza civilians.""This is important because we have no desire to harm the population,"" Netanyahu told a news conference in Tel Aviv. ""We have a very strong desire to hurt Hamas.""Harris also sketched out a U.S. vision for post-conflict Gaza, saying the international community must support recovery and Palestinian security forces must be strengthened.""We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the center of this work,"" she said, adding that Hamas must no longer run Gaza.The Western-backed Palestinian Authority governs parts of the occupied West Bank. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' mainstream Fatah party and has ruled the enclave ever since.Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas once and for all. The Iranian-backed Islamist group is sworn to Israel’s destruction. One of its officials has said Hamas would repeat the Oct. 7 attacks if possible.The Israeli military said it had killed Wessam Farhat, commander of a Hamas battalion who sent fighters to hit two kibbutzim near the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7. It also described him as one of the planners of the raid.Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel did not want to see Gaza's civilians caught in the crossfire.""Israel is targeting Hamas, a brutal terrorist organization that has committed the most horrific violence against innocent civilians. Israel is making a maximum effort to safeguard Gaza's civilians,"" Regev said.He said that when the war was over, Israel would seek a ""security envelope"" with special zones and arrangements to prevent Hamas from being positioned on its border.Throughout Saturday morning, a steady stream of wounded people were carried into the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Gaza health officials said 650 had been wounded since the truce collapsed.The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross said the renewed fighting was intense.[1/14]Smoke billows after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, as seen from southern Israel, December 2, 2023. REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko Acquire Licensing Rights""It's a new layer of destruction coming on top of massive, unparalleled destruction,"" Robert Mardini told Reuters in Dubai.With conditions inside Gaza reaching ""breaking point,"" in Mardini's words, the first aid trucks since the end of the truce entered from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, Egyptian security and Red Crescent sources said. Some 100 trucks passed through, carrying food, water and medical supplies, the sources said.A senior official said Israel would facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza's civilians.The warring sides blamed each other for the collapse of the seven-day truce, during which Hamas had released hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.Israel said it had recalled a team from Qatar, host of indirect negotiations with Hamas, accusing the Palestinian faction of reneging on a deal to free all the women and children it was holding.French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said he was heading to Qatar to work on a new truce.The deputy head of Hamas, however, said no prisoners would be exchanged with Israel unless there is a ceasefire and all Palestinian detainees in Israel are released.Saleh Al-Arouri told Al Jazeera TV that Israeli hostages held by Hamas are soldiers and civilian men who previously served in the army.But Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas breached its commitment to free 17 women and children still held in Gaza and insisted that the militant group must keep its word.The southern part of Gaza including Khan Younis and Rafah was pounded on Saturday. Residents said houses and a school had been hit and three mosques destroyed in Khan Younis. Columns of smoke rose into the sky.Hamas said it targeted Tel Aviv with a rocket barrage. There were no reports of damage but paramedics said one man was treated for a shrapnel injury in central Israel.Displaced Gazans have been sheltering in Khan Younis and Rafah because of fighting in the north, but residents said they feared Israeli troops were preparing to move south.Palestinian witnesses said Israeli tanks had taken up positions near the road between Khan Younis and Deir Al-Balah.Yamen, who gave only his first name, fled to Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza from the north after Israel destroyed several districts there.""Where to after Deir Al-Balah, after Khan Younis? I don't know where I would take my wife and six children.""On Saturday morning, Israeli air strikes hit areas close to the Nasser Hospital six times, medics and witnesses said.The hospital is filled with thousands of displaced and hundreds of wounded, including many of those who had been evacuated from north Gaza hospitals.""A night of horror,"" said Samira, a mother of four.

ABC,Suspected bomb blast kills at least 4 worshippers during Mass in southern Philippines,2023-12-02 21:10:00,JIM GOMEZ Associated Press,"MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine president blamed “foreign terrorists” for a bomb blast that killed four people Sunday, wounded dozens of other Catholic worshippers in the south and sparked a security alarm, including in the capital, Manila, where state forces were put on alert.The suspected bomb, which the police said was made from a mortar round, went off and hit students and teachers who attended a Mass in a gymnasium at Mindanao State University in southern Marawi city, Taha Mandangan, the security chief of the state-run campus, told The Associated Press by telephone.Dozens of students and teachers dashed out of the gym and the wounded were taken to hospitals.Regional military commander Maj. Gen. Gabriel Viray III said four people were killed by the explosion, including three women, and 50 others were brought to two hospitals for treatment.Six of the wounded were fighting for their lives in a hospital, said Gov. Mamintal Adiong Jr. of the Islamic province of Lanao del Sur, which has Marawi as its capital.“I condemn in the strongest possible terms the senseless and most heinous acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists upon the Mindanao State University,” President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in a statement. “Extremists who wield violence against the innocent will always be regarded as enemies to our society.”Marcos did not explain why he immediately blamed foreign militants for the high-profile bombing. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. later told a news conference without elaborating there was a strong indication of a “foreign element” in the bombing.Military chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said the bomb attack could be retaliation by Muslim militants for a series of battle setbacks.“We are looking at possible angles,” Brawner said. “It could be a retaliatory attack,”He cited the killing of 11 suspected Islamic militants in a military offensive backed by airstrikes and artillery fires on Friday near Datu Hoffer town in southern Maguindanao province.Regional police director Brig. Gen. Allan Nobleza said the slain militants belonged to Dawlah Islamiyah, an armed group that had aligned itself with the Islamic State group and still has a presence in Lanao del Sur province.Mosque-studded Marawi city came under attack from foreign and local Islamic militants who had associated themselves with the Islamic State group in 2017. The five-month siege left more than 1,100 dead, mostly militants, before it was quelled by Philippine forces backed by airstrikes and surveillance planes deployed by the United States and Australia.Army troops and police cordoned off the university shortly after the bombing and began an investigation, checking security cameras for any indication of who may have been responsible for the attack. Security checkpoints were set up around the city.Police Lt. Gen. Emmanuel Peralta told reporters that military and police bomb experts found fragments of a 60mm mortar round in the scene of the attack.Such explosives fashioned from mortar rounds had been used in past attacks by Islamic militants in the country’s south.The deadly blast set off a security alarm beyond Marawi city as the Christmas season ushered in a period of travel, shopping sprees and traffic jams across the country. Police and other state forces were put under “heightened alert” in metropolitan Manila, security officials said.The Philippine coast guard said it ordered all its personnel to intensify intelligence gathering, stricter inspections of passenger ferries and the deployment of bomb-sniffing dogs and sea marshals.""Amid this barbaric act, best public service must prevail,” coast guard chief Admiral Ronnie Gavan said.The southern Philippines is the homeland of minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation and the scene of decades-old separatist rebellions.",3832,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/suspected-bomb-blast-kills-3-christian-worshippers-southern-105334760,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/466d6411-899b-41fa-9a7b-6c72f29619a8/wirestory_f01092608d55b8a9d077f19149f16d0c_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,nobleza local admiral brought minority element plane hoffer traffic enemy brig alarm adiong blast period sunday student set found explosive dawlah fashion possible deployed alert intensify airstrikes campus metropolitan innocent scene taha defense battle slain city woman perpetrate round dead left predominantly friday university teodoro bombing heinous spree gavan offensive gov coast act heighten mass blame align fire gathering back shortly official roman gabriel islamiyah condemn deadly foreign put country muslim past belong amid fight gymnasium province group conference elaborate troop dash security arm state rebellion strong terrorist jam mortar personnel expert separatist worshipper check police ronnie emmanuel order nation responsible mindanao ferry hospital passenger barbaric militant siege public service include prevail brawner christmas south kill indication wound angle deployment cordoned investigation fragment presence maguindanao ferdinand news staff director told guard chief intelligence peralta term inspection reporter president retaliation homeland datu catholic press capital lanao allan senseless islamic violence military life marcos commander iii force retaliatory explain secretary marshal stricter united extremist associate immediately marawi begin manila statement explosion ushered dozen artillery attack regard teacher gilberto viray quell checkpoint season suspect hit romeo gym philippine mamintal series southern spark travel wield surveillance camera make town bomb attend shopping mandangan,-0.9744,0.4697286012526095,13.188580246913578,0.2777027027027027,0,2023-12-02
CNN,"‘A hero every day’: He joined Ukraine’s Maidan protests at 16. At 24, he died fighting Russia",2023-12-02 20:53:00,Jessie Yeung,"Taras Ratushnyy remembers receiving a phone call from his son Roman during Ukraine’s deadly 2013 Maidan Revolution.“I’m okay, we are coming back home with my friends from (Kyiv’s Maidan Square). Don’t worry and good night,” Roman said over the phone – even while Taras heard that same voice blaring from his television as his 16-year-old son declared the protesters’ plans to storm a building.The protests, which spread across Ukraine and came to symbolize its existential tug-of-war between Europe and Russia, set into motion a young generation determined to shape the nation’s future – and at the fore was Roman.In some ways, his political convictions began long before Maidan. Both his parents were previously activists and journalists; his mother Svitlana Povalyaeva, also a writer and poet, took part in the Maidan Revolution alongside her two sons.But that path became clear as Roman came of age against the backdrop of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, and violence between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in the eastern regions.By 2022, he had become a well-known environmental and anti-corruption activist, with a following of supporters and admirers.Then, Russia invaded Ukraine.Roman immediately enlisted with the military, as did his brother and father. Nine years after the Maidan Revolution lit a spark, he was again fighting on the front lines for the future of his country, and for the democratic hopes shared by many of his generation.But he knew he might not survive this fight. By May that year, Ukraine was losing up to 100 soldiers a day, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.That month, Roman – who “had a plan for everything he did,” Taras said – wrote his last will and testament on a single sheet of A4 paper, using both sides.He laid out requests for his funeral – the ceremony, the music, the Cossack cross monument. He quoted one of his mother’s poems. And he dedicated his love to the city where he was born, as were his parents, and grandparents: “Kyiv, I died far from you, but I died for you.”Two weeks later, on June 8, 2022, Roman was killed in action near Izium, in eastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv Oblast. He was 24 years old.“My son is a true hero of Ukraine,” Taras told CNN during a recent visit to the oak-lined cemetery in Kyiv where Roman was laid to rest. It was the 10th anniversary of the Maidan protests; Taras had just one day at home before he returned to the battlefield. “He used to be a hero every day.”The Maidan protests were sparked by Ukraine’s then-President Viktor Yanukovych abruptly scrapping a trade deal with the European Union. Supporters of the deal had hoped it would bring Ukraine closer to the West, generate economic growth, and open borders to trade.Instead, Yanukovych – a pro-Russia leader – turned toward Moscow, striking new deals with Vladimir Putin, and dashing the opposition’s hopes of stronger ties with Europe.Furious, thousands of demonstrators occupied Kyiv’s Maidan, or Independence Square. Over the months, the protests swelled to represent broader outrage over Yanukovych’s policies, widespread government corruption, and police brutality — as well as the movement’s pro-democracy, Europe-leaning dreams.In the midst of all this was Roman. At the time, the best way to find the 16-year-old was to “go to the hottest point (of the clashes),” said Taras. “Ninety-nine percent (of the time) he was there, and one percent he was sleeping somewhere because he was out of batteries.”As violence escalated, Roman would sometimes get caught in scuffles – but he forged ahead, an early sign of the idealistic, passionate spirit his father would later describe to CNN.In her book about the revolution, history professor Marci Shore recalled asking Roman whether his mother was upset about his participation in the protests. The teenager replied: “My mother was making Molotov cocktails on Hrushevskogo Street.”The ensuing crackdown came to a head on February 20, 2014, when police and government forces opened fire on protesters. About 100 people are believed to have died during the revolution, which ultimately saw Yanukovych ousted and exiled from Ukraine.The movement triggered a chain of events that would roil Ukraine for years, including the annexation of Crimea and the simmering conflict in the east near Russia’s border. But it also brought a spate of government reforms – and hope to a generation of young Ukrainians hungry for change.“Just like (how) you can’t see the forest for the trees, we, as participants of the Maidan, may not be able to see now what impact this event had on the whole history of Ukraine, but I hope it had a serious impact,” said Roman said in a YouTube video uploaded in 2014, near the anniversary of the protests.“For me, all that was not in vain,” he added. “I see a huge number of positive changes in this country. And they happened only thanks to Maidan.”When the war broke out in 2022, Roman – who had become known for fighting to protect a green space in Kyiv from real estate development – joined the Battle of Kyiv to push Russian forces from the capital.He then joined the 93rd separate mechanized brigade, helping to liberate a town from Russian occupation and fighting in Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy Oblast.Through it all, he posted occasional Instagram photos of himself and fellow soldiers – at one point posting a poem by the executed Ukrainian intellectual Mykhail Semenko.“When I die, I will die not of death / but of life,” reads one translation of the poem by Ukrainian-American writer Boris Dralyuk. “When all nature grows calm, I’ll depart, / ahead of the last stormy night – / in a flash, when death seizes my heart, / my youth, my life, and my fight.”His father, meanwhile, tried not to think about the danger Roman was in.“All I can do is ask, how are you? How can I help you? But (those were) kind of stupid questions from a father who is very far and cannot make any impact on his condition,” Taras said during his visit to the cemetery in November.After Roman was killed in June 2022, his body was brought back to Kyiv, with the funeral and memorial service attended by hundreds of mourners including the city mayor. Large crowds gathered in Independence Square to pay tribute – the very place he had fought as a young protester in 2013, when his future stretched long and bright before him.Now, more than a year later, the memory of Roman’s legacy – and that of the Maidan Revolution – continues to resonate with Ukrainians as the war grinds on into its second winter, and as Ukraine pushes hard to join the European Union.This longtime ambition took a step forward in November, when the bloc’s executive body said detailed negotiations for membership should begin next year.During CNN’s visit to Roman’s grave, two young women stopped by to pay their respects; several fresh flower bouquets and candles sat next to his photograph.“I wish him to be proud of us. I see that it’s one year and more (since his death), but almost every day something is going on connected with Roman,” Taras said, visibly emotional. “Thousands of Ukrainians are stepping into the battle in his name trying to continue what he did. I see that Roman is still in action.”",7201,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/world/roman-ratushnyy-ukraine-maidan-revolution-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200720163717-jessie-yeung-2020.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,translation membership trigger knew request large read television conviction action cnn occasional intellectual declare bring body visit outrage number fellow brutality resonate woman boris storm midst crimea change return stretch mourner instagram journalist existential writer share thousand abruptly call back impact fore front push swell make event backdrop bouquet maidan izium spirit leader growth forge political single sheet video bloc early motion service moscow oust brought teenager forest symbolize lit execute tie kharkiv annexation kind upset positive brigade yanukovych alongside gather molotov fire percent friend force head country supporter vain book photo detailed dedicate bright blaring connect oblast protester clear music crackdown cossack previously economic estate european violence russian plan point stormy week green scrap young long illegal future set life stupid deadly day closer hero negotiation nature testament government begin president grind laid flash happen corruption parent northeastern heart born caught time step youtube real proud brother viktor tara join broke protest battlefield independence condition chain fresh part roman rest accord father separate ultimately movement cross post separatist sleep death eastern spark enlist tree question spread poem trade stop executive reply nation uploaded flower grows city heard hard protect sumy line quote june candle vladimir place putin dash youth voice determine crowd turn emotional history dralyuk ahead memory believe write hundred home development ukrainian square liberate generate mykhail strong receive pay fight mechanize continue phone reform year opposition police ensue funeral soldier sat seizes strike hrushevskogo represent democratic conflict recent revolution union mother broader add demonstrator ceremony environmental love wish ratushnyy grave exile povalyaeva cemetery ukraine memorial worry participation describe deal russia attend roil longtime space immediately fought night occupation huge depart forward shore cocktail battle policy path anniversary kill border winter town visibly danger poet calm tribute europe military volodymyr hungry lose month remembers hope marci kyiv find clash sign generation scuffle november follow activist svitlana hottest age hop west passionate simmer respect include open survive escalate told professor february east participant occupy widespread mayor shape monument ambition paper invade idealistic grandparent legacy recall,-0.6816,0.2499652825996389,8.34224089635854,0.373625283446712,0,2023-12-02
Washington Post,"Henri Lopes, writer who mocked African autocrats and served one, dies at 86",2023-12-02 20:36:00,Brian Murphy,"At the Paris funeral of Congolese writer Henri Lopes, mourners from literary communities on two continents praised the searing truths of his novels that used fictional strongmen to ridicule political corruption and brutality in Africa.Also in attendance at the Nov. 14 service was a high-level delegation sent by the Republic of Congo’s president, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, whose autocratic and repressive government Mr. Lopes served in the prominent role as ambassador to France.The paradox came to define Mr. Lopes and his work over more than five decades: the enigmatic insider who could write mocking parodies of African power and manage to keep both worlds from colliding. That required both literary boldness and, at times, personal acquiescence, said Mr. Lopes, who died Nov. 2 at a hospital in the Paris suburb of Suresnes at 86.He offered unsparing critiques of post-colonial Africa in books including “Le Pleurer-Rire” in 1982 (published in English as “The Laughing Cry”). Yet Mr. Lopes held back from any major public denunciations of Sassou-Nguesso or deep reflections on his connections to the regime, which has waged widespread abuses including harsh repression of opponents, according to human rights groups.Sassou-Nguesso first ruled the Republic of Congo — next to the larger Democratic Republic of Congo, the former Zaire — from 1979 to 1992, losing in multiparty elections. He then reclaimed control in 1997 after a brief civil war. Mr. Lopes (pronounced LO-pez) served from 1998 to 2015 in Paris as ambassador, the country’s most important diplomatic post.Mr. Lopes’s stature as one of Francophone Africa’s literary trailblazers was seen as offering legitimacy to Sassou-Nguesso’s regime even as allegations mounted of human rights abuses and rigged elections. A 2021 State Department report cited “significant human rights issues” linked to Sassou-Nguesso’s rule, including government-ordered killings, torture, stifling free expression and endemic corruption in an oil-rich country where poverty is rampant.“I could have made excuses for [Sassou-Nguesso], which would not have been credible. Or I could have criticized, even though I had just left his team,” Mr. Lopes explained in an interview with Jeune Afrique magazine after leaving the ambassadorship. “So, I took the risk of saying nothing.”This was not the first time that Mr. Lopes had to juggle his writerly judgments on African leadership and the realities he witnessed in politics and diplomacy.In the 1970s, Mr. Lopes served in several top political roles, including prime minister from 1973 to 1975 under president Marien Ngouabi. The Marxist-inspired government of Ngouabi was accused of carrying out systematic crackdowns on dissent and other rights abuses. Ngouabi was assassinated in 1977 by political rivals, touching off vigilante bloodshed and court-ordered executions.In a 1993 interview, Mr. Lopes offered an oblique reply on how he navigated the apparent contradictions of serving regimes but also condemning heavy-handed rule in his writing. “Which ‘me’ is it?” he told the journal Research in African Literatures. “The public ‘me’? The ‘me’ of my obscure private life or another ‘me’ that remains unexpressed, fantasized and possibly unfulfilled in real life?”Such layers are embedded in Mr. Lopes’s narratives. His characters shift between local languages, dialects and French. Each switch holds a meaning, he said. The native languages such as Lingala often evoke tribal bonds and shared experience. French — what Mr. Lopes called “this borrowed language that I love” — was the foundation of his stories and represented colonialism and the lingering European cultural force across Francophone Africa.His debut book in 1971, “Tribaliques” (published in English as “Tribaliks” in 1987) is a collection of eight short stories that throw a caustic glance at West Africa’s European-influenced urban elite, depicted by Mr. Lopes as homegrown colonizers standing in the way of political maturity. “The Laughing Cry,” one of Mr. Lopes’s most-read works, conjures a fictional African country run by a megalomaniacal dictator, Bwakamabé, who sways between crippling paranoia and patronizing delusions, calling himself “Daddy.”The result is a burlesque of vanity and ruthlessness, with many readers drawing comparisons to rulers such as Uganda’s Idi Amin and the Central African Republic’s Jean-Bedel Bokassa.“I, I am the father. And you, you are my children,” proclaims the fictional Bwakamabé. “You should give me advice, with frankness. But if you are afraid of my reactions, and you want to spare me, you should shut up respectfully.”Washington Post reviewer Alan Ryan wrote that Mr. Lopes, who spent his teens and university years in Paris, imbued a “European point of view” in creating Bwakamabé and his realm. “But he still sees them through African eyes,” Ryan added. “Somewhere in the middle, in that conflict of views, is the truth.”In Mr. Lopes’s 2015 novel “Meridional,” he explored race and cultural identity in ways that reflected his own life. The book’s main character is mixed race, like Mr. Lopes, and struggles over how he fits in as a resident of France.“Being mixed race didn’t just mark me,” Mr. Lopes told the French magazine Le Point. “It made up my identity, my essential existence.”Henri Lopes was born on Sept. 12, 1937, in what was then Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) in the Belgian Congo, which is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.His parents were mixed race, the product of relationships between French and Belgian colonizers and local women, Mr. Lopes wrote in his 2018 memoir, “Il est déjà demain” (“It is Already Tomorrow”).After his parents divorced, his mother married a French man and moved to Paris, bringing along the 12-year-old Mr. Lopes. He finished his primary education in France and received a bachelor’s degree in history from the University of Paris in 1962 and a master’s degree the following year.He took a teaching position in Brazzaville, capital of the newly independent Republic of Congo, and was later recruited into the government. His posts included justice minister and foreign minister.In the late 1960s, Mr. Lopes wrote the lyrics to a national anthem used from 1970 to 1991, “Les Trois Glorieuses,” named after a three-day uprising in 1963 that toppled the country’s first president, Fulbert Youlou. The anthem’s second verse begins: If the enemy kills me too early/ Brave comrade, seize my gun.“I often wonder if, in the end, the accession to national sovereignty was not, the greatest shock, the most total revolution, experienced by [Africans],” Mr. Lopes said in a 2021 interview with the magazine Le Point Afrique.When Sassou-Nguesso regained power in 1997, Mr. Lopes was in Paris as a deputy director general with the U.N. cultural organization UNESCO. He resigned to accept the ambassador post.Survivors include his wife, the former Christine Diane, and four children from his first marriage, to Nirva Pasbeau.In the 2002 detective story “Dossier Classé,” Mr. Lopes again raised questions of mixed-race identity that followed him throughout this life. In the story, Mr. Lopes created a journalist, Lazare Mayele, who goes to an imaginary French-speaking country in Africa. The reporter — described as having an African father and French mother — at one point decides he is “sans-identite-fixe,” an outsider in Africa, in Europe and his home in the United States.",7413,https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/12/02/henri-lopes-africa-writer-dies/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,advice divorce credible power local offer navigate resign literary tribal prime urban human widespread writer democratic attendance reflect layer elite reviewer repression total brutality born nirva personal enemy narrative great unesco mock systematic remains shift insider stand parent reply former topple held witness decides autocratic frankness finish prominent language rule republic suresnes love unexpressed mixed funeral imbue glorieuses imaginary pronounce english denis shut ruler stature central afraid view congo journal parody endemic lingala justice free apparent congolese married outsider lyric research strongman literature tribaliques repressive government lope create require draw washington woman decade paranoia déjà define rival ruthlessness recruit touch left criticize multiparty henri stifle leadership european university bwakamabé politics depict afrique switch brave give belgian write accession seize patronize alan léopoldville denunciation follow realm serve control continent french back receive condemn teach caustic fictional foreign evoke opponent meridional significant country killing team demain minister contradiction election independent legitimacy writerly publish accept explore department maturity crackdown cry christine colonialism ngouabi political home wonder truth delegation large possibly trois trailblazer issue comparison diplomatic add comrade deep identity revolution colonizer bachelor lose corruption wag meaning debut move raise ambassador magazine native represent regime brazzaville result collide throw work reality carry struggle hospital book bloodshed manage reader unsparing hold short public marien service include kinshasa tribaliks post civil megalomaniacal deputy unfulfilled reflection laugh bond child major accord sway sovereignty risk conflict kill eye judgment race interview described top boldness father shock homegrown uganda general ridicule west amin newly call mother dossier primary diane assassinate juggle dictator director excuse fantasize resident wife ambassadorship critique told conjures national spent reporter president leave position harsh collection fit private capital world point regain embed share cultural ryan praise real education life zaire year bring force explain africa mayele enigmatic story accuse mourner france african detective verse proclaims question lazare journalist linger united foundation expression spare essential vanity begin mount uprise allegation relationship reclaim oblique run middle glance cripple classé experience dissent sear time offering experienced torture important acquiescence connection youlou burlesque vigilante fulbert jeune suburb rig role obscure paradox late delusion francophone community link anthem character reaction master borrow dialect memoir paris report poverty make tomorrow product organization mark abuse europe history marriage state degree,-0.9653,0.1618777822743828,9.962643678160916,0.2951320132013201,0,2023-12-02
Reuters,US VP Harris urges Israel to protect Gaza civilians,2023-12-02 20:02:00,"Nandita Bose, Steve Holland","DUBAI, Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Saturday too many Palestinians are being killed in Gaza and urged Israel to do more to protect them as she sketched out a U.S. vision for post-conflict Gaza.At a news conference on the sidelines of the COP28 summit, Harris said Israel has a legitimate right to conduct military operations against Hamas militants, who launched attacks from Gaza on Oct. 7 in which more than 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed.""As Israel defends itself, it matters how. The United States is unequivocal: International humanitarian law must be respected. Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed,"" Harris said.The United States has been increasingly vocal that Israel must narrow the combat zone during any offensive in southern Gaza and ensure safe areas for Palestinians.""As Israel pursues its military objectives in Gaza, we believe Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians,"" she said.More than 15,000 people have been killed so far in Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities.Harris consulted with regional leaders while attending the climate summit in Dubai, after being asked by U.S. President Joe Biden to take his seat at the table as he focuses on the Israel-Hamas war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was only looking to hurt Hamas.""We determine safe areas in coordination with international agencies and with our American friends, to where the population knows it can evacuate. We did it in the north and we will do it elsewhere and this is important because we have no desire to harm the population,"" he told reporters in Tel Aviv.In another message directed at Israel, Harris said the United States will not permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, the besieging of Gaza or the redrawing of Gaza's borders.""The international community must dedicate significant resources to support short- and long-term recovery in Gaza, for example, rebuilding hospitals and housing, restoring electricity and clean water and ensuring that bakeries can reopen and be restocked,"" she said.Eventually, the Palestinian Authority security forces must be strengthened to assume security responsibilities in Gaza, but until then, she said, ""There must be security arrangements that are acceptable to Israel, the people of Gaza, the Palestinian Authority, and the international partners.""Looking further down the road, she said, the Palestinian Authority should be bolstered to the point that it can govern both the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas can no longer run Gaza, she said.""We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority (PA), and Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the center of this work,"" she said.Netanyahu has said he is unwilling to allow the PA in its present form to run Gaza after the war ends.""The Palestinian Authority doesn't fight terrorism - it funds terrorism, it doesn't teach peace, it preaches the disappearance of Israel. This is not the body that should go in there,"" Netanyahu said on Saturday.Once the war ends, efforts to rebuild should be pursued with a view toward the goal of a two-state solution in which Israel and the Palestinians live in peace, Harris said, referring to a long-sought U.S. objective that has not borne fruit.The Western-backed PA governs parts of the occupied West Bank. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party and has ruled the enclave ever since.Harris' role in the administration is coming under increased scrutiny as Biden, 81, runs for a second four-year term.

Politico,Israel needs to protect civilians or risk ‘strategic failure’ in Gaza,2023-12-02 17:26:00,Paul McLeary,"SIMI VALLEY, California — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered a stark public warning to Israel on Saturday, saying the government there risks “strategic defeat” in Gaza if it doesn’t do more to protect civilians.The comments came a day after the breakdown in negotiations over hostage and prisoner releases led to the resumption of the Israel-Hamas war. Austin told an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum that if Israel doesn’t do everything possible to protect civilians, it might help “drive [Palestinians] into the arms of the enemy,” and would “replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”The Biden administration has been warning its Israeli counterparts in private over the human toll of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, where Hamas has placed rocket launchers and command-and-control centers in civilian neighborhoods.Austin said the U.S. learned hard lessons in Iraq and Afghanistan over killing and displacing civilians and acknowledged that fighting a war in a dense urban center places significant burdens on a democratic nation trying to follow the laws of war.“The lesson is not that you can win in urban warfare by protecting civilians,” said Austin, who commanded troops in the Middle East. “The lesson is that you can only win in urban warfare by protecting civilians.”Israel has repeatedly warned the people of Gaza to move from sites of active fighting and has dropped leaflets advising civilians to move south, away from some of the heaviest early fighting. Hamas killed 1,200 Israeli civilians in a cross-border attack Oct. 7 that focused on murdering and kidnapping civilians.Israel’s renewed bombing has started to target areas in the south of Gaza, and Israel wanted Gazans away from some areas since Friday. The refugees from northern Gaza are increasingly being asked to move into smaller areas, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis across the strip.Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Israel and the U.A.E. late last week, and on Friday he blamed Hamas for the failure of the temporary cease-fire. It is “important to understand why the pause came to an end: It came to an end because of Hamas. Hamas reneged on commitments it made.”Hamas fired rockets into Israel on Friday before the truce ended and failed to produce Israeli hostages it had pledged to release.On Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that after releasing over 80 hostages, “Hamas violated the agreed framework” by refusing to release 17 more women and children.“As a result of Hamas’ decision not to fulfill that which was agreed upon, and in accordance with the War Cabinet’s decision, yesterday morning I instructed the IDF to resume fire,” he said.",2681,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/02/israel-civilians-gaza-00129762,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/fdddc0f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5324x3549+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F42%2Ffc%2Ff8aefb664e53af7a42cb01db71cd%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1807744710,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,gaza site repeatedly offer advise move understand administration resume result prisoner antony dense urban human gazans nation place democratic failure israel cabinet exacerbate breakdown burden enemy protect negotiation public hard afghanistan launcher valley start yoav warfare south law framework yesterday risk kidnapping kill humanitarian learn hamas truce comment drive murder lead told lloyd possible national leaflet israeli violate airstrikes heaviest pledge away refuse simi stark austin defense private fail week day government pause temporary hostage increasingly woman fulfill toll warn focus command counterpart secretary acknowledge east friday blinken win northern bombing renege renew audience replace rocket small idf early biden tactical follow accordance california active blame fire civilian strategic drop instruct forum middle attack significant refugee commitment area decision center resumption minister defeat iraq crisis morning important agree fight lesson displace late troop gallant reagan arm palestinian saturday produce target victory release state,-0.9901,0.5594927265945543,11.038597938144328,0.389423076923077,0,2023-12-02
CNN,‘Bone biographies’ reveal what life was like for Black Death survivors in medieval England,2023-12-02 16:42:00,Ashley Strickland,"Scientists have used the remains of some 500 people to create a series of “bone biographies” that provide a glimpse inside the ordinary lives of plague survivors of the English city of Cambridge.The skeletons, which came from a series of archaeological digs that began in the 1970s, date back to between 1000 and 1500.During that medieval era, Cambridge was home to a few thousand people. The bubonic plague — known as the Black Death — came to the city between 1348 and 1349, killing 40% to 60% of its population, according to the study.Archaeologists used radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis to study the bones of townsfolk, scholars, friars and merchants, eventually focusing on 16 people by examining their DNA, bodily trauma, activities and diets to paint a fuller picture of their existence, called osteobiographies. The findings appear in a study published Thursday in the journal Antiquity.“An osteobiography uses all available evidence to reconstruct an ancient person’s life,” said lead study author John Robb, a professor at Cambridge University, in a statement. “Our team used techniques familiar from studies such as Richard III’s skeleton, but this time to reveal details of unknown lives — people we would never learn about in any other way.”The bone biographies are available on Cambridge University’s After the Plague project website.“The importance of using osteobiography on ordinary folk rather than elites, who are documented in historical sources, is that they represent the majority of the population but are those that we know least about,” said study coauthor Dr. Sarah Inskip, researcher and osteoarchaeologist at the University of Leicester, in a statement.The five-year After the Plague project, which began in 2016, focused on investigating burials from Cambridge’s Hospital of St. John the Evangelist, the medieval parish church of All Saints by the Castle, and the Augustinian Friary. Together, the bones tell a collective story about a cross section of people living in medieval Cambridge and the hardships they faced.The researchers gave their subjects pseudonyms based on records from the time.“Death and time ensure anonymity for our sources, but we wanted to them to feel relatable,” Robb said.The osteobiographies provide windows into the lives of people such as Anne, a woman with repeated injuries that caused her to hobble on a shortened right leg, and Eudes, a friar with a square jaw who enjoyed a rich diet and suffered from gout.The bones also tell surprising stories, such as that of Edmund, who suffered from leprosy but may not have been diagnosed and wasn’t ostracized. He lived among the general population before being buried in a rare wooden coffin, rather than a simple burial shroud. And then there was Wat, who survived the plague and died as an older man with cancer.Wat was a resident of the charitable Hospital of St. John, which was founded to house the poor and infirm as a type of medieval benefits system.“Like all medieval towns, Cambridge was a sea of need,” Robb said. “A few of the luckier poor people got bed and board in the hospital for life. Selection criteria would have been a mix of material want, local politics, and spiritual merit.”A dozen or so people could stay at the hospital at a time and sometimes lived there for years. The hospital was founded in 1195 and lasted for hundreds of years before St. John’s College replaced it in 1511. It was founded to help the poor, rather than provide medical care, and statutes prevented the limited staff from taking in those who could not care for themselves.“We know that lepers, pregnant women and the insane were prohibited, while piety was a must,” Robb said. The hospital residents were required to pray for the souls of the hospital benefactors, Robb said. “A hospital was a prayer factory.”While many of the skeletons belonged to locals who lived in Cambridge or surrounding villages, three people buried at the hospital’s cemetery appeared to have traveled great distances to reach the city. One of them was a woman named Christiana.An analysis of her bone chemistry suggests she came from as far as Norway. The researchers aren’t sure what brought her to Cambridge as a young adult, but it was likely for a short-term trip involving trade, traveling with merchant family members, or attending the annual Stourbridge Fair, one of the largest fairs in England held on the outskirts of the city.Sometime during her visit, Christiana died. Her bones don’t reveal injury or severe chronic disease, but a rapid infection may have killed her.While the hospital didn’t take in short-term residents for medical care, Christiana was laid to rest in the cemetery’s consecrated ground as a form of charity, according to the project.Analyzing each skeleton gave the researchers insights into the diets of Cambridge’s residents, the physical toll of their daily lives, and any illnesses or injuries they endured. The bones revealed how tough life could be.For example, half of those buried in the All Saints cemetery did not survive childhood. And children buried in the hospital cemetery were small for their age, showing signs of anemia, injury and illness such as tuberculosis.The hospital residents bore traces of harsh childhoods shaped by famine and widespread diseases. But things often changed once they came to stay at the hospital, showing they were served a balanced and nutritious diet that allowed many to improve in their final years.Because it can take years for dietary changes to be reflected in bones, the analysis showed that some residents, such as Maria, may have lived there for five to 10 years. Maria experienced illness from the time she was young, and likely died of tuberculosis between the ages of 18 and 25.Things were different for the men at the Augustinian Friary, who were on average an inch taller than the townspeople and enjoyed a diet filled with meat and fish.Studying arm bones also revealed a population of early university scholars buried in the hospital cemetery. The townsmen all had strongly developed right arms, reflecting the manual or craft labor of their trade, but 10 male skeletons stood out.“These men did not habitually do manual labour or craft, and they lived in good health with decent nutrition, normally to an older age. It seems likely they were early scholars of the University of Cambridge,” Robb said. “University clerics did not have the novice-to-grave support of clergy in religious orders. Most scholars were supported by family money, earnings from teaching, or charitable patronage. Less well-off scholars risked poverty once illness or infirmity took hold. As the university grew, more scholars would have ended up in hospital cemeteries.”Some skeletons belonged to those who did not survive the plague, such as Dickon, who died between 45 and 60 years old.

NPR,"7.6 magnitude quake strikes off southern Philippines, triggering tsunami warnings",2023-12-02 13:47:00,The Associated Press,"MANILA, Philippines â€” A powerful earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 struck Saturday off the southern Philippine coast, prompting many villagers to flee their homes in panic around midnight after Philippine authorities issued a tsunami warning. The quake struck at 10:37 p.m. at a depth of 32 kilometers (20 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of major damage or casualties. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially said that based on the magnitude and location, it expected tsunami waves to hit the southern Philippines and parts of Indonesia, Palau and Malaysia. But the center later dropped its tsunami warning. In Japan, authorities issued evacuation orders in various parts of Okinawa Prefecture, including for the entire coastal area, affecting thousands of people. Teresito Bacolcol, the head of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, told The Associated Press his agency advised residents along the coast of southern Surigao del Sur and Davao Oriental provinces to immediately evacuate to higher ground or move farther inland. Owners of boats in harbors, estuaries or shallow coastal waters off the two provinces should secure their boats and move away from the waterfront, the quake agency said in its tsunami warning. Boats already at sea should stay offshore in deep waters until further advised, it said. Based on the quake's magnitude, Bacolcol said a 1-meter (3.2-foot) tsunami may hit but the wave could be higher in enclosed coves, bays and straits. Villagers were fleeing their homes to safety around midnight in Hinatuan town and outlying areas in Surigao del Sur province, according to authorities and the government's disaster-response agency, which said that it could not immediately provide specific details. Pictures posted on Hinatuan government's Facebook account show residents fleeing to higher ground on foot or aboard cars, trucks, motorcycles and tricycle taxis at night. More than three hours after the quake hit, Bacolcol said there was no report of a tsunami hitting the coast from his agency's field offices but added authorities would continue monitoring. The Philippines, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, is often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of seismic faults around the ocean.

The plant has a capacity of 1,295 megawatts, enough to power more than a million homes.According to the American Geosciences Institute, burning coal produces more carbon emissions compared to burning any other non-renewable fuel. Coal power can have as much as twice the carbon footprint as natural gas.For instance, coal produces about 211 pounds of heat-trapping carbon dioxide per million BTUs of energy produced, compared to natural gas which produces about 117 pounds and gasoline which is about 156 pounds, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.COP28 logo on the opening day of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on November 30, 2023.

Washington Post,Hamas release of Russian hostages highlights Putin’s new Mideast stance,2023-12-02 12:17:00,"Mary Ilyushina, Francesca Ebel","RIGA, Latvia — When a Hamas delegation visited Moscow in late October, Russian diplomats handed the group a list of eight Russian-Israeli citizens being held hostage in Gaza — captives Russia wanted the Palestinian militant group to set free. Hamas immediately signaled that the list would get special attention, state-run media reported.“We are very attentive to this list and will process it carefully because we look at Russia as our closest friend,” a senior member of Hamas, Mousa Abu Marzook, told RIA Novosti news agency. “As soon as we find them, we’ll release them.”Since then, Hamas has been making good on its pledge.Three of the Israeli Russian hostages were released. That number included Roni Krivoi, 25, a sound engineer who was working at the music festival attacked by Hamas. Last Sunday, he became the first adult male with an Israeli passport set free, even as most of the exchanges involved women and children.Moscow stressed that the release of Krivoi and the subsequent freeing of two more Israeli Russian dual nationals — Elena Trufanova, 53, and her mother, Irina Tatti, 73 — were secured independently of mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt that achieved a pause in fighting and other releases.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, posting on Telegram last Sunday, credited “the release of a Russian passport holder” — evidently Krivoi, although she did not name the hostage — to “direct agreements between Russian representatives and Hamas,” which she noted Moscow intends to continue.“We are grateful to the leadership of the Hamas movement for their positive response to our urgent appeals,” Zakharova said Thursday. “We will continue to strive for the speedy release of the remaining Russians held in the Gaza Strip.”The special treatment for the abducted Russians is a new manifestation of the growing alignment between the Kremlin and Hamas. President Vladimir Putin seeks to present himself in the relationship as a leader and champion of a new “multipolar world order,” and the Palestinian militant group gets a veneer of legitimacy at a time when many countries have branded it as a terrorist organization.Since Oct. 7, when Hamas carried out an attack inside Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting more than 200 others, Putin has carefully calibrated his position, apparently keeping in mind Russia’s growing reliance on Iran, a main sponsor of Hamas, as a supplier of drones and missiles for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.Russia initially expressed “concern” over the attack but did not condemn Hamas. And rather than stressing condolences to Israel, Moscow pointed fingers at the United States and the West, blaming Washington for decades of failure to resolve the long-simmering conflict in the Middle East and suggesting that Russia could be a mediator.While Hamas quickly became a pariah in much of the world after the Oct. 7 attack, Russia rolled out a red carpet for the Hamas delegation.“The fact that Moscow invited them in late October is a very big deal as it’s a way for Hamas to show that they are not some alleged terrorists and that they are being invited for official talks,” Ruslan Suleymanov, an independent Russian expert on the Middle East, said in an interview. “So these releases are a gesture from Hamas to highlight Putin’s special role, but only the U.S., Egypt and Qatar take part in the real talks about hostages and the cease-fire.”Hamas has also benefited from political and diplomatic support provided by Russia in its role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, where its representatives blocked U.S.-led resolutions against Hamas.But while potentially expedient in the short term, Russia’s pivot toward Hamas also carries risks. Already, it has driven a wedge between Russia and Israel, putting in jeopardy the Kremlin’s prided ability to juggle relationships with all parties in the region — no matter how bitterly they hate each other, analysts said.It is also unclear that Hamas even knows the whereabouts of the remaining hostages on Russia’s list.And while Moscow has built ties to Hamas’s Qatar-based political wing, to whose representatives the Russians handed their list, Russia has no leverage with the military arm of the group operating on the ground in Gaza and which ultimately will decide who is freed now that the pause in fighting brokered by the United States has ended.In any case, Krivoi, the abducted sound engineer, was a lucky beneficiary of Russia’s diplomatic outreach. He was released, the first hostage adult male with an Israeli passport to be set free, and sent to a hospital in Tel Aviv.A few days later, Trufanova and Tatti, a doctor from southern Russia who moved to Israel five years ago to reunite with her daughter, were released. The pair were kidnapped from Trufanova’s home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Her husband, Vitaly Trufanov, was killed during the Oct. 7 attack, and her son, Alexander, is still in captivity.Hamas has also played up Russia’s role.“The prisoners were released during the truce period but separately from the rest of the hostages, as they are not part of this deal,” said Hamas official Basem Naim. “This action is in appreciation of the Russian position supporting the rights of the Palestinian people in general and the resistance. It also aims to strengthen this bilateral relationship for future collaboration.”Naim said others on Russia’s list “could be missing on the other side” — meaning Israel. “But,” he added, “in case there is another truce, we would keep searching, and releasing them is possible.”Putin not only refrained from condemning Hamas after the attack but also did not immediately call Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who for years was considered one of his closest friends among world leaders.Some Russia watchers regarded Putin’s stance as revenge for Netanyahu’s lack of demonstrative support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and also as a sign of a grudge against Israel for giving refuge to thousands of Russians who have fled Putin’s government in the past two years.Suleymanov said Russia was also using the war in Gaza to portray itself as allied with countries in the Global South against the West.“Putin is partially rejoicing that right now the U.S. security system and its relationship in the Middle East are facing their toughest test in years,” he said. “Because it’s the U.S. that was promoting Israel’s alignment with the Arab world but is now forced to juggle its own ties to it while taking a very clearly pro-Israeli stance.”“Russia, in conditions of Western isolation, is trying to demonstrate itself as an anti-Western force,” Suleymanov added. “But this is a test for Russia, too, as it can’t afford to lose Israel.”Although Russia had long portrayed itself as capable of working with anyone in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine has realigned Putin’s foreign policy — forcing the Kremlin to move closer to Iran. That alliance had deeply alarmed Israel even before the attack by Hamas.Abbas Galyamov, a political consultant and former Putin speechwriter, said the Russian president had lost a carefully balanced position.“For years, he walked a tightrope between Israel and his Middle Eastern partners in the face of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, Iran and the Palestinians, but after Oct. 7, they fell on the side opposite of Israel,” Galyamov said. “I view it as him losing the ability to conduct independent foreign policy in the region and turning more into an Iranian proxy.”“The ayatollahs perhaps said, ‘We supported you on your key issue, Ukraine, so it’s time to stop fussing and support us on our fundamentally important issue,” he added.Galyamov said Putin’s siding with Hamas could undermine his goal in Ukraine: to sustain the fight until Western support for Ukraine begins to erode — something that could happen faster if Donald Trump returns to the White House.“In that regard, part of Republicans who are isolationist are his allies, even if they don’t sympathize with him personally but believe that two post-Soviet states fighting are not their business,” Galyamov said. “But supporting Israel is the peak of their policy. And by aligning with Hamas, Putin is knocking the wind out of their sails, as they’ll see he sides with evil wherever he appears.”",8310,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/02/russia-hamas-putin-hostages-israel/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUJWPTTOVR3OVVNV2OOJM6PLKI_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUJWPTTOVR3OVVNV2OOJM6PLKI_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUJWPTTOVR3OVVNV2OOJM6PLKI_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUJWPTTOVR3OVVNV2OOJM6PLKI_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUJWPTTOVR3OVVNV2OOJM6PLKI_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUJWPTTOVR3OVVNV2OOJM6PLKI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,peak engineer grateful white mediation highlight member drone secure prime carpet played evidently elena speedy iran demonstrate missile stance analyst test alliance krivoi sponsor beneficiary conduct former held express syria urgent potentially period sunday concern resolve truce happen pivot russian mind reliance toughest policy set attention ukraine tightrope strengthen ministry view fuss leverage israeli alarmed hate free spokeswoman apparently eastern galyamov outreach trufanov alexander believe walk big telegram refuge positive treatment champion driven government fell pause sign hostage expedient search washington woman decade pariah marzook tie involve quickly naim note condition leadership initially portrayed donald senior sustain basem pride give ago unclear decide signal partially align blame closer whereabouts official matter condemn ally foreign stop wind put separately country past minister part riga independent legitimacy realign fight broker global special abduct group vladimir movement qatar deeply isolationist flee security arm palestinian political strive attentive home rest delegation terrorist issue diplomatic watcher release add leader future manifestation bilateral expert veneer business direct gaza invite operating bashar dual lose arab nir medium meaning move find condolence number trump prisoner moscow suggest work carry order nation consultant council representative doctor ria failure wing hospital israel region rejoice tel opposite irina militant thursday short sympathize promote agreement hand include talk festival pair post fact south western lucky sail wedge mousa evil captive risk action conflict sound kill abu invasion interview multipolar appreciation system oz general hamas benjamin undermine west allied diplomat brand mother red call allege exchange russia lack permanent juggle husband bitterly friend news told key resistance national continue goal ground partner term portray president aim inside kibbutz benefit appeal case revenge position finger fundamentally demonstrative world point day kremlin intend ruslan thousand side ultimately party putin egypt military real roni erode vitaly consider year block freed force roll citizen passport east novosti resolution republican adult ayatollah subsequent balance grudge seek suleymanov united maria personally achieve present immediately begin refrain agency support speechwriter credit zakharova relationship jeopardy october supplier reunite carefully attack middle remain independently grow regard return tatti time deal provide closest kidnap alignment important trufanova list long response stress turn show role ability gesture late process faster music iranian southern isolation male built daughter afford capable visit february calibrate netanyahu make miss knock latvia holder state,0.0438999999999999,0.1083032490974729,9.778006349206349,0.3454086738949125,0,2023-12-02
NPR,Israel says it has hit more than 400 targets in Gaza since end of truce with Hamas,2023-12-02 12:10:00,Scott Neuman,"A Palestinian man carries a child wounded during an Israeli bombardment in Rafah, on the southern Gaza Strip, on Saturday. TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military says it attacked more than 400 targets throughout Gaza in the 24 hours since the end of a week-long cease-fire with Hamas sparked a resumption of combat operations. The Israel Defense Forces released video and photos of Israeli soldiers conducting ground operations and aerial footage showing airstrikes on buildings and infrastructure. One video, that appeared to target a human figure walking in a street, was described by the IDF as ""a strike on terrorists"" in western Jabalia, an area in Gaza's north. In a statement, the IDF said that air force fighter jets had struck more than 50 targets around Khan Younis, a city in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. The heavy bombardment and ground operations across Gaza killed nearly 200 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more in the first day of resumed fighting, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. The temporary truce that collapsed early Friday followed seven weeks of fighting in Gaza sparked by simultaneous attacks on southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7. The attacks killed 1,200 people, Israel says. The militants also seized around 240 captives, more than 100 of whom were subsequently freed in a series of hostages-for-prisoners swaps during the cease-fire. Israel released nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners and detainees as part of the deal. Vice President Harris told reporters on Saturday that Israel must do more to protect civilians in Gaza. Speaking in Dubai, the site of the COP28 climate summit, She said Israel had a right to ""eliminate the threat of Hamas"" after the Oct. 7 attack, but she emphasized that ""it matters how."" ""Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating,"" she said. ""We believe Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians,"" Harris said. The pause in fighting and exchange of captives — an agreement originally slated to last four days — was extended another three days to facilitate more hostages-for-prisoners swaps. Earlier this week, CIA Director William Burns and David Barnea, the chief of Israel's spy agency, Mossad, held talks with Egypt Intelligence Minister Gen. Abbas Kamel and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani in Qatar on the possibility of further extending the cease-fire. There was some hope that the deal could be revived even after the resumption of hostilities in Gaza. However, on Saturday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement saying that Barnea had ""ordered his team in Doha to return to Israel."" It added that Hamas ""did not fulfill its part of the agreement, which included the release of all children and women according to a list that was forwarded to Hamas and approved by it."" ""The head of the Mossad thanks the head of the CIA, the Egyptian Minister of Intelligence and the Prime Minister of Qatar for their partnership in the tremendous mediation efforts that led to the release of 84 children and women from the Gaza Strip in addition to 24 foreign citizens,"" the statement said. Harris declined to comment on details of talks to free more hostages. Israel has notified at least five Israeli families that their loved ones taken hostage by Hamas are no longer alive. More than 100 others remain in captivity, according to Israel's military. A United Nations official tells NPR that about 50 aid trucks managed to enter Gaza via a border crossing with Egypt and were waiting to be unloaded Saturday morning. However, the vehicles did not reach Gaza's hardest-hit north. The number of trucks delivering aid on Friday was also far fewer than the around 200 per day during the week-long pause in fighting — a number that relief officials have said is far too small to meet the needs of Gaza's 2.2 million people. Even so, a senior official of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the cease-fire ""offered a glimpse of what can happen when the guns fall silent.""

""We need to maintain – and build on – the progress in aid delivery,"" Martin Griffiths, OCHA's under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said. ""We need civilians and the life-sustaining infrastructure they rely on to be protected. We need the remaining hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally. We need a humanitarian ceasefire. We need the fighting to stop."" Amid what international groups have described as a growing humanitarian crisis in besieged Gaza, Israel says it will not renew the visa of the top U.N. aid official for the Palestinian territories. Nearly three years ago, Canadian-born Lynn Hastings was named deputy special envoy for the Middle East peace process and the resident coordinator for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said on Friday that the U.N. had been informed by Israeli authorities ""that they would not renew the visa of Miss Hastings past its due date at some point later this month,"" according to Israeli media. In a statement to NPR, Israel's foreign ministry confirmed that Hastings' visa would not be renewed.

Federal government spokesman Legesse Tulu did not respond to a request for comment.The federal government and its Oromiya regional counterparts have mobilised security teams to push out the rebels from areas they control, Hailu said.The latest attacks came just days after a second round of talks between the government and the OLA to resolve the decades-old conflict ended in Tanzania without a deal.Seventeen people were killed on Nov. 24 when attackers raided one village and 11 were killed on the same day in another village, residents of the area told Reuters.One farmer lost seven members of his family, including his wife and son.

CNN,What happens when nature and cities collide,2023-12-02 11:00:00,Katie Hunt,"More than half of the world’s population live in urban areas where nature can feel like a distant concern.Thriving ecosystems do, however, exist within our cities — even beneath our feet — and embracing urban nature can be a powerful force for change.For example, West London has its first beaver dam in 400 years after the reintroduction of a family of five in October to a wetland on the city’s outskirts. The industrious beavers could help to prevent flooding after heavy rainfall.Our Shared Home was the theme this week for CNN’s third annual Call to Earth Day, during which the network highlighted the crucial connection between cities and wilderness.Interactions between urban dwellers and wildlife don’t always run smoothly.Cape Town’s baboons can often be found rummaging through garbage cans and around backyards, putting them at greater risk of conflict with humans.For the primates, the raiding behavior makes some sense — the suburbs encroach on their feeding grounds. Easy access to food from Cape Town’s trash means baboons spend less time and energy foraging, and more on socializing with potential mates and the rest of their group.However, there are consequences for the baboons. Their health and welfare can suffer as the primates come into contact with dogs, cars and electric power lines. Some baboons have even been shot.The city has begun taking proactive measures to keep them away from Cape Town’s outskirts and in their natural hillside habitat.Much nature photography focuses on the wild wonders of Earth and its majestic biodiversity.Two photographers whose works CNN profiled as part of the Call to Earth initiative took a different approach. They captured intimate views of wildlife in an urban habitat.Photographer Corey Arnold discovered a bear denning in a California home’s crawl space, while in the lush hillsides of Hong Kong’s New Territories, Lawrence Hylton recorded a collared scops owl, a white-lipped pit viper and an Atlas moth during his nocturnal safaris through Shing Mun Country Park.The stunning, and sometimes amusing, images show how smart some animals are at adapting to a human-dominated landscape.The sun is entering a period of heightened activity, making it easier to witness dazzling natural displays like the northern lights or their counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere.There have also been sightings of an even rarer night-sky phenomenon that occasionally accompanies auroras. Known as Steve, it appears closer to the equator than polar auroras and is characterized by a purple-pink arch and green vertical stripes.The mysterious light show was formally identified less than a decade ago, and explanations of what causes it are still taking shape.The phenomenon’s name also has an unusual origin story involving a 2006 DreamWorks movie.Astronomers have discovered six planets around a nearby sunlike star with orbits that haven’t changed for more than 1 billion years.Larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, the exoplanets are in a little-understood class called sub-Neptunes commonly found in the Milky Way.As the planets revolve around their host star, which is about 100 light-years away from Earth, they display a pattern known as orbital resonance. This is when the planets complete their orbits and exert gravitational forces on one another, creating a harmonic rhythm, with all six planets aligning every few orbits. Scientists believe the discovery could help unravel mysteries of planet formation.Scientists have created tiny living robots from human cells that can move around in a lab dish and may one day be able to help heal wounds or damaged tissue, according to a new study.A team at Tufts University and Harvard University’s Wyss Institute have dubbed their creations anthrobots.The research builds on the first living robots, or xenobots, which were made from stem cells sourced from the embryos of African clawed frogs.However, the human cell-based bots differ in several ways from their froggy forerunners, and they displayed a behavior that surprised scientists.Check out these remarkable stories:— Celebrate the trailblazing achievements of NASA astronaut Dr. Mary Cleave, who died November 27.

Reuters,Israeli shells hit southern Lebanon in second day of violence after Israel-Hamas truce ends,2023-12-02 10:31:00,not specified,"BEIRUT, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border on Saturday in a second day of hostilities after the collapse of a truce in Gaza between Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.Iran-backed Hezbollah said in a statement that one of its fighters was killed but did not specify when. Three people in south Lebanon were killed by Israeli shelling on Friday in south Lebanon, according to Lebanon's state news agency. Hezbollah said two of the dead were its fighters.Hezbollah also said it fired rockets at an Israeli position. Israel's military said two mortar bombs launched from Lebanon fell in open areas in Shomera, across the border from the south Lebanon village of Marwahin. The military said it responded by attacking the launch site and elsewhere in south Lebanon.Earlier on Saturday, shelling from Israel hit close to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) headquarters near the coastal town of Naqoura and around the border village of Rmaych, a UNIFIL spokesperson said.The Israeli military said it carried out shelling near Naqoura after spotting ""unusual activity"" in the area.UNIFIL also detected fire around 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) from the area of Tayr Harfa, about a mile from the Israeli frontier, toward Israel, the spokesperson said.Following the eruption of the Hamas-Israel war on Oct. 7, Hezbollah mounted near-daily rocket attacks on Israeli positions at the frontier while Israel waged air and artillery strikes in south Lebanon.

Washington Post,Gaza strikes intensify as U.S. warns Israel over civilian deaths,2023-12-02 09:36:00,"Liz Sly, Kareem Fahim","AMMAN, Jordan — Israeli warplanes struck targets across Gaza on Saturday, intensifying the resumed bombardment of the enclave as hopes faded that a collapsed deal to halt the fighting could be revived.With roughly 200 people reported killed in the latest strikes, the United States also escalated pressure on Israel to do more to avert the heavy civilian casualties that are turning public sentiment worldwide against a continuation of the war.Many of the strikes were in southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had taken refuge after the Israeli military had told them to relocate there for their safety. Israel has said that it believes Hamas commanders are also hiding there alongside civilians.The shift in focus to the south suggested Israel is preparing to expand its ground operations beyond the Gaza City area where it has established control of some neighborhoods. Israeli aircraft dropped leaflets on several regions in southeastern Gaza ordering civilians to evacuate further west, triggering speculation that a new ground incursion from Israel could be imminent.But there were also strikes in the northern part of the enclave, including at the much-bombed Jabalya refugee camp and in the Shejaiya neighborhood east of Gaza City, where 10 strikes killed at least 60 people and leveled dozens of apartment buildings, according to civil defense spokesman Mahmoud Basal. He said it was likely many more bodies were under the rubble, but they could not be extracted “because we don’t have equipment.”A local Hamas commander, Wissam Farhat, was killed in the Shejaiya strikes, according to Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, who released aerial footage of the bombing. Farhat was responsible for an attack during the 2014 Gaza war that killed seven Israeli troops, he added.Israeli troops are still encountering Hamas militants in northern Gaza, another Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said at a news conference on Saturday.Earlier in the day, the Gaza Health Ministry said that at least 193 people were killed and 652 injured after the collapse of a week-long humanitarian pause heralded the resumption of fighting between Israel and Hamas on Friday. The ministry also issued its first updated casualty figures in three weeks, saying that a total of 15,207 people have been killed and over 40,652 injured since the outbreak of hostilities on Oct. 7. The initial Hamas attack that triggered the war killed around 1,200 people in Israel.Amid mounting U.S. pressure to minimize civilian casualties, a senior Israeli official said the military was following a new strategy aimed at distinguishing between Hamas fighters and ordinary people.“We will do everything we can to keep civilians out of the crossfire between Israeli forces and Hamas,” said Mark Regev, senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.But Vice President Harris, speaking in Dubai where she is attending the COP28 climate conference, said Israel needs to try harder.“Far too many Palestinian civilians have been killed and Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians,” she told a news conference, calling the suffering “truly heartbreaking.”“As Israel defends itself, it matters how,” she added.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also weighed in, warning Israel in stark terms on Saturday that a failure to protect civilians will undermine its war efforts against Hamas. “In this kind of fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population,” Austin told a defense forum in Simi Valley, Calif. “And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”The IDF reported hitting 400 targets in the 24 hours after the collapse of the pause, suggesting that this second phase of the war will be no less intense than the first. At least 50 strikes were carried out in and around the southern town of Khan Younis, the IDF said, signaling the expansion of the campaign to the south.The seven-day pause had brought a respite from seven weeks of fighting, enabling the release by Hamas of 134 hostages, most of them Israelis, in return for around 400 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel under a deal mediated mainly by Qatar.The negotiations involving Qatari, Israeli and U.S. officials had continued in the Qatari capital, Doha, even after the fighting resumed, and Israeli military officials had indicated a readiness to implement another pause if mediators could persuade Hamas to release more hostages.But later Saturday, Israel announced that Netanyahu had recalled the Israeli negotiators, saying the talks on further hostage releases had reached an “impasse.”A statement from Netanyahu’s office blamed Hamas for the failure, saying that the militant group had failed to implement an agreement to release all the women and children it kidnapped.Hamas also said there would be no further hostage exchanges with Israel until the Gaza war is over. The group’s deputy head, Saleh al-Arouri, told Al Jazeera that the only hostages Hamas has left are soldiers and civilians who were serving in the army, and that all the women and children have already been released.“Israeli prisoners will not be released until our prisoners are freed and after a cease-fire comes into effect,” Arouri said, referring to Palestinians held by Israel.Israeli officials meanwhile indicated that this second phase of the war would continue until Israel had achieved its goal of eradicating Hamas.“The war will be ongoing for whatever time it takes to completely destroy Hamas and get back the hostages,” Israeli government spokesman Ofir Gendelman told reporters Saturday.Lerner said the IDF used the pause in fighting to resupply and study its strategy for a “long war” that is “not bound by time.”The renewed violence has brought fresh misery to the over 2 million residents of Gaza, swamping the territory’s crippled hospitals with scores of new injuries as the United Nations warns that medical supplies are running out.The strikes instilled new panic among civilians who had escaped from the north in the belief they would be safer there and now are confronted with new evacuation orders.The Israeli plan for avoiding civilian casualties appeared to involve a new map dividing Gaza into scores of small, numbered zones, which residents will be ordered to move among as the fighting shifts. There were also leaflets dropped in the north Saturday instructing residents to relocate from some zones to others.People who have already been displaced multiple times said they were confused and now believe nowhere is safe.“Every time they say, ‘Move to a safe place,’ and when we move we find it’s not safe,” said Najwa Khalil, 36, a mother of two. She said she relocated with her family on Saturday for the fourth time since the war began, initially from the north to the south, and most recently from the Qahara neighborhood east of Khan Younis to the western edge of the city after receiving a recorded warning from the Israelis to move.Khalil said she and her family were now cowering in a single room listening to intense bombardments nearby. “I don’t know, literally, where to go. It is terrifying and unbearable,” she said.The U.N. humanitarian affairs agency criticized the “evacuation zone map” for lacking clarity as to where residents were supposed to evacuate to, and saying it was unclear how residents were supposed to access the map given that many lack electricity.The delivery of humanitarian supplies resumed on Saturday after being suspended on Friday, but at a lower level than was the case during the pause, with 100 aid trucks entering Gaza across the border with Egypt, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.U.N. officials have also warned that Gazans are at risk of dying of hunger and disease as the medical system deteriorates and food runs short, raising fears that the expanding violence combined with a humanitarian crisis will force an exodus of Gaza residents to neighboring Egypt, something Egypt has said it will not allow.Harris told Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi at a meeting in Dubai on Saturday that the United States would not permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, or the West Bank, where violence has also been intensifying.She added that the United States will also not accept the “besiegement” of Gaza or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza, calling for “a clear political horizon for the Palestinian people towards a state of their own,” according to a White House statement.",8528,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/02/israel-gaza-hamas-war/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4D7FM2XJLC2VEMFBBGULY6ACXI.JPG&w=440

NPR,Some Israeli hostages are coming home. What will their road to recovery look like?,2023-12-02 07:01:00,Rachel Treisman,"A man wearing an Israeli flag looks toward ambulances outside a hospital in Petah Tikva, Israel, on Nov. 24. Hamas has released over 100 of the more than 240 people it kidnapped from Israel on Oct. 7 as part of a hostage and prisoner exchange enabled by the weeklong cease-fire that ended on Friday. Those freed in Gaza were mostly women and children, including some foreign nationals. At the same time, hundreds of Arab residents of the West Bank who had been held in prisons by Israel have been freed. This has created two sets of populations, including many children, in need of psychological support as they return to freedom. In Israel, as the freed hostages return home, Israeli and U.S. media have been awash with photos and videos of their emotional reunions with surviving loved ones (including some pets) as well as emerging details about their nearly two months in captivity. Most hostages have not spoken with the media directly, though accounts from family members suggest at least some were given limited access to food, beds, bathrooms and medications. One 84-year-old woman was returned to Israel over the weekend in critical condition. Some families say their relatives lost weight and came home with head lice. One man said his aunt had to readjust to sunlight after spending so much time in a tunnel. The families of two young girls said they only spoke in whispers upon their arrival because they had been told not to make noise in captivity. Family members of several hostages of all ages described them as physically but not mentally OK in interviews with NPR. Many are returning home to learn that their loved ones were killed on Oct. 7 or are still being held in Gaza. For many, feelings of relief are mixed with those of guilt and exhaustion. And relatives and experts have voiced concern about the potential long-term effects of the ordeal on hostages, particularly young children. That's what the family of four-year-old Abigail Idan — a dual American-Israeli citizen whose parents were among the some 1,200 people killed on Oct. 7 — told NPR. Her great-aunt Liz Hirsh Naftali said Idan is ""overjoyed"" to be back with her siblings, but declined to elaborate on her condition. ""I think that we will only learn as the days go on, and for a long time, what really effectively will be the results of having been a hostage and having been in her father's arms when he was murdered,"" Hirsh Naftali said. Experts told NPR that the road to recovery from such an experience can be long, but there are steps that caregivers, loved ones and professionals can take to help children who were held hostage navigate a path forward. In anticipation of the release of hostages, Israel's health ministry worked with child trauma specialists to come up with a handbook for how people should interact with them. Ayelet Noam-Rosenthal, a social worker at the Haruv Institute in Jerusalem and one of the authors of the guide, says it includes protocols for ""everyone that will meet the child,"" from parents to pediatricians to teachers. ""Here in Israel after the horrific events of Oct. 7, where children were kidnapped after witnessing massacre and severe violence, we actually understood that we have to focus also on the day after,"" she told NPR. ""That means the day after they return, and address both their immediate and long-term needs."" The Times of Israel reports that the new protocols cover best practices for both the hours and weeks after hostages are released. It has instructions for the Israeli soldiers accompanying children on their way to the hospital, including how to introduce themselves and how to answer (or deflect) their questions, CNN reported. Hostages are to be brought to one of six Israeli hospitals, where they can reunite with family members and receive a suitcase with some of their clothing, medications and personal items. They also receive a thorough medical exam, which the Times reports must be performed by female doctors. The guide says those exams should check for evidence of rape or torture, and that if any is found, ""appropriate professionals"" should be consulted on whether it would be possible collect the evidence or interview the patient without re-traumatizing them. There is also guidance on proper nutrition and avoiding potentially-fatal refeeding syndrome, which can happen when food is reintroduced to a malnourished person. Liz Cathcart, the executive director of the nonprofit Hostage U.S. (which supports families of Americans taken hostage but cannot comment on which cases it is working on) says malnutrition is common among hostages. That could be due to a lack of nutritious food and food in general or the inability to keep food down because of stress. Other potential issues include vitamin deficiencies, diseases contracted in captivity and sleep disturbances, according to Hostage U.S. The physical health of the hostages is the immediate priority, Cathcart tells NPR. ""Without the physical health checks and making sure that your physical health is up to par, you're not able to then take the next steps to recovery and reintegration,"" she says. Noam-Rosenthal says parents and professionals should take every precaution to avoid re-traumatizing children who were held captive. ""We must all work together to strengthen the child's resilience and work toward his or her adjustment to the new circumstances,"" she says. For instance, the Times reports that while doctors can evaluate whether adults are healthy enough to recount their experience to law enforcement, the ""debriefing of children will be delayed for some time."" Noam-Rosenthal says it's crucial to rebuild trust ""because that's one of the things these children lost along the way."" One of the first things her team tells family members is that they need to give children their autonomy back — for example, letting them set the pace for physical touch, even if the parents are desperate to hug them immediately. Longer-term, she says it's important for parents and professionals to work together in support of the child's well-being. She called for full coordination of ""the military, the health and the social services as one system driven by the same goal."" Building resilience and coping skills are key to helping former captives adjust to their new normal, Cathcart says. And it's not just the hostages themselves who need help. Families of hostages are coming off a ""two-month marathon"" of worrying about and fighting for their loved ones' release, Cathcart says. Before they can shift their focus to that person's recovery, she says, they need to take care of themselves too. ""What I always encourage families to do when their loved one gets home is to focus on yourself, too, because it's so important that the families are mentally healthy, that they're fed, that they have energy,"" she adds. ""Because if they don't, they're not going to be able to support their family member."" Hostage U.S. recommends that hostages and their families work to ""establish a routine without being regimented,"" think through potential triggers (like loud noises or dark rooms), communicate openly and be patient throughout the reintegration process. ""The use of simple words and short sentences is important,"" the ministry advises, according to CNN. ""It is important to convey that we are open and able to hear and talk about difficult things."" As part of the temporary truce, Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom are minors. Prior to Oct. 7, some 500-700 Palestinian children were subjected to Israeli military detention every year, in some cases without charge, trial or due process guarantees, according to Save the Children. The organization welcomed the release of both Israeli and Palestinian children as part of the deal. But Jason Lee, Save the Children's country director in the Palestinian Territories, called it ""just the first step needed"" in addressing a decades-old crisis affecting children in the region. ""A lasting ceasefire must be agreed immediately, all hostages in Gaza must be released, and the appalling emotional and physical abuse of Palestinian children in detention must end,"" he added. More than 13,300 Palestinians — roughly two-thirds of them women and minors — have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. The count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The United Nations has warned that Gaza is becoming a ""graveyard for children,"" while the World Health Organization has raised alarms about the spread of infectious diseases in the territory. And researchers are worried about the toll the war will take on the mental health and development of the children who do survive. Studies conducted before the current conflict documented especially high rates of mental and behavioral health issues among Gaza's youth, who make up nearly half of its population.",8891,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/02/1216210180/israeli-gaza-hostages-recovery,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,immediate handbook pediatrician bathroom navigate emerge limited member coordination dark step deficiency sleep convey word contract noise brought hirsh cop simple recommends haruv crucial jason personal relief executive weeklong alarm critical building priority forward marathon ayelet shift enable detail hundred conduct parent former medical held witness fed jerusalem concern learn guidance appropriate happen freedom truce introduce healthy mixed set captivity answer appal found adjustment comment save strengthen ministry energy possible israeli item family severe npr delayed full specialist awash prior particularly advises ordeal caregiver health driven hostage create cnn woman detention toll charge touch rape condition food friday lee difficult institute person nutrition perform inability malnutrition give suitcase protocol encourage social accompany welcome meet autonomy civilian exam back anticipation weight receive readjust cover foreign study american understood wear access country disturbance prison team part petah debrief liz count fight especially bank mentally elaborate clothing ceasefire guide exhaustion graveyard professional nonprofit arm open palestinian combatant rate home emotional infectious reintroduce issue patient territory skill release account add nutritious expert gaza tikva due interact voiced dual sentence arab directly instance lose medium raise check psychological result reunion practice desperate prisoner suggest work trial half population disease recount nation doctor roughly hospital consult israel region hug decline soldier precaution short service include deflect talk behavioral guarantee circumstance girl massacre proper common law development high accord child captive evaluate conflict kill flag spoke interview described father system malnourish author general hamas effect hour west reintegration call worry subject ambulance whisper physically youth distinguish normal worried exchange lack murder room director rebuild resident told address loud key national naftali goal aunt effectively vitamin horrific case evidence sunlight path hear photo week world day age temporary researcher resilience enforcement month affect military violence young physical idan warn event focus year spending establish refeeding freed louse citizen instruction adult avoid regiment question spoken current survive united immediately head begin weekend adjust support feeling tunnel abigail reunite overjoyed worker collect routine experience return video mental teacher relative sibling time deal trauma communicate crisis torture kidnap pace female important agree trust long syndrome recovery arrival cathcart stress medication potential process spread trigger bed guilt openly road make report organization minor abuse love document,-0.9801,0.1687099313912945,9.664477972238988,0.463900806534735,0,2023-12-02
New York Times,"Israelis Are Angry at Netanyahu, but Chances of His Ouster Are Slim",2023-12-02 06:53:00,Sheera Frenkel,"Reporting from Tel AvivBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has weathered many controversies, including accusations of corruption and allegations this year that a contentious overhaul of the country’s judiciary was a poorly disguised power grab.But he now faces the greatest crisis of his political career. The backlash to his government’s failures to prevent the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage, and criticism of his handling of the war in Gaza, are steadily growing.People both inside Mr. Netanyahu’s government and those who hope to see him replaced agree that his standing has never been so low with the Israeli public.And yet — owing to the complexities of Israel’s parliamentary system and the vagaries of war — few paths exist for Mr. Netanyahu to be ousted soon from office. His long-term political prospects and his legacy, however, rest largely on how he handles the coming days, analysts said.AdvertisementIn recent days and weeks, vigils for slain Israelis have turned into protests over Mr. Netanyahu’s leadership. Calls for him to take responsibility for the intelligence failures that preceded the Hamas attack have morphed into a campaign seeking his resignation.A far-right member of his governing coalition, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has threatened to topple the government. Members of Mr. Netanyahu’s own Likud party have talked about defecting, according to two senior party members. And the United States, Israel’s closest and most important ally, has begun pushing the prime minister to limit the number of civilian deaths in Gaza.As the war entered a new phase on Friday after the collapse of a seven-day truce and the start of a renewed Israeli air campaign, Mr. Netanyahu is searching for a solution — including the potential assassination of Hamas’s top leader in Gaza — that could appease his coalition, silence his critics and satisfy a population desperate for him to both bring home the remaining hostages from Gaza and defeat Hamas.In a statement to reporters on Friday, Mr. Netanyahu said that he was committed to “destroying Hamas.” Privately, he has told aides that he is pushing for the military to assassinate the head of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, according to a current Israeli official and a former one who have spoken with the prime minister in recent days.AdvertisementMr. Netanyahu believes, the officials said, that the assassination of Mr. Sinwar, the presumed mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks, would be enough to convince the Israeli public that a major victory had been won against Hamas and the war can end.Israeli political analysts said Mr. Sinwar’s death could stem, but not reverse, the tide of public anger directed at Mr. Netanyahu.“If the Israeli military succeeded in assassinating a major Hamas figure, I expect Netanyahu would seek to take credit,” said Anshel Pfeffer, a columnist for Haaretz newspaper, and the author of “Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.”Mr. Pfeffer added that despite the many past scandals that have rocked Mr. Netanyahu’s reputation, he has always managed to save his political skin.AdvertisementFor much of the past year, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to protest the prime minister’s plans for a judicial overhaul. Many Israelis see the changes as tied to Mr. Netanyahu’s ongoing trial on charges of corruption, though he has denied any connection between the two.In a Sept. 7 poll by Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, 75 percent of respondents said that they believed that Mr. Netanyahu’s government was “functioning well.”But in the weeks since the start of the war, Mr. Netanyahu’s numbers have steadily dropped. In a poll released on Friday by the Israeli newspaper Ma’ariv, 30 percent of respondents said that Mr. Netanyahu was best fit to serve as prime minister, while 49 percent preferred his closest political rival, Benny Gantz, a former defense minister.The same poll found that support for Likud had also fallen.In Israel, governments are formed through a multiparty system based on which party can cobble together a majority of at least 61 seats in the 120-seat Parliament.Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition currently holds 74 seats. To topple him, at least 13 members of Parliament would need to leave his coalition or a no-confidence vote would have to be held in the legislature with another candidate selected to replace Mr. Netanyahu.AdvertisementAviv Bushinsky, a former political adviser to Mr. Netanyahu, said that neither scenario was likely.“Almost everyone you speak to today will tell you the same thing — that Netanyahu must step down from office — he cannot continue to lead this country,” said Mr. Bushinsky. “And yet, at the same time, there is a very real scenario in which he remains prime minister despite his unpopularity because of the difficulty in replacing or removing him.”Mr. Bushinsky said that some members of Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party had spoken about splintering to form their own party, but they were unlikely to do so in the midst of a war.“People are only going to strike while the iron is hot,” Mr. Bushinsky said. “It’s not just about them leaving Likud; it is about them being able to put together their own coalition of 61 people who will support them. I just don’t see a political constellation like that which will work.”Israeli political sentiment, he added, has shifted to the right since Oct. 7. Any future election, he predicted, could be won only by a right-wing candidate who was seen as a strong military leader.AdvertisementMany of the Israelis who gathered on Friday afternoon in Tel Aviv’s so-called Hostage Square agreed with Mr. Bushinsky. The large area outside the Tel Aviv Art Museum has become a regular site of protest, mourning and celebration for the families of those abducted from Israel and taken to Gaza on Oct. 7.On Thursday, Moran Gal, 24, and her boyfriend came to the square to cheer and celebrate the return of eight Israeli hostages. But by Friday, with the cease-fire ended and reports trickling out that some of the oldest hostages held by Hamas had been killed, Ms. Gal had tears on her face.“This is all Bibi’s fault,” said Ms. Gal, a student, using Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname. “How come he hasn’t apologized? How come he hasn’t admitted he failed us?”In Jerusalem, where almost-daily protests have been held in front of Parliament calling for Mr. Netanyahu’s resignation, hundreds gathered on Thursday night to listen to Eran Litman, whose daughter was killed on Oct. 7.AdvertisementMr. Litman accused the Israeli prime minister of failing to protect his daughter and of returning to war in Gaza instead of saving the lives of additional Israeli hostages.“He only thinks about himself, not about his country,” said Mr. Litman.“Shame,” a crowd of hundreds thundered each time he mentioned Mr. Netanyahu’s name.Sheera Frenkel is a reporter based in the San Francisco Bay Area, covering the ways technology impacts everyday lives with a focus on social media companies, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram and WhatsApp. More about Sheera FrenkelAdvertisement",7190,https://www.nytimes.com//2023/12/02/world/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-hamas-war.html,"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/12/02/multimedia/02israel-politics-zlcp/02israel-politics-zlcp-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/12/02/multimedia/02israel-politics-zlcp/02israel-politics-zlcp-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/12/02/multimedia/02israel-politics-zlcp/02israel-politics-zlcp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp 2048w",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jVot1lhu9PmkBYqVP_y4QAHaGg&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain succeed newspaper reporting thursday accuse replace facebook begin kill criticism sinwar francisco litman closest likud country judicial crowd expect ongoing stem connection told past frenkeladvertisement hot official weather reputation mastermind backlash population party govern disguise minister recent figure currently cover celebration itamar moran appease statement majority steadily tide push rest owe constellation convince admit base head celebrate jerusalem multiparty museum front protect social manage put boyfriend low mr death precede air exist seat strong civilian largely serve deny topple member ally save solution military former week vigil poll telegram office add plan cheer resignation hold public parliamentary presume defense gather crisis student direct failure current bushinsky daughter believe pfeffer major iron scandal prefer future overhaul instagram support leave assassination search continue fail focus allegation oust israel accusation parliament remove function splinter bay path fit bring assassinate defeat leadership gal morph additional scenario anger shift destroy broadcaster handle site slain analyst company difficulty stand vagary impact power government instead critic prime seek terrorist strike home trial nickname day great cobble square include gaza hostage silence legislature charge israeli fault attack aviv privately adviser lead area whatsapp controversy found vote reporter midst limit time rival number tel satisfy technology career youtube predict defect street shame reverse truce gantz sentiment thousand credit accord columnist benjamin mourn inside sheera san report political enter threaten remains collapse legacy art important prospect change call phase tiktok year abduct avivbenjamin respondent apologize top protest senior rock today real step complexity election drop hundred frenkel mention spoken release ariv speak large coalition campaign hope commit corruption turbulent regular anshel renew agree intelligence haaretz night state system listen netanyahu medium afternoon leader candidate poorly return yahya potential hamas percent select unpopularity victory contentious despite form twitter family held prevent turn bibi trickle desperate friday united talk start author tie tear thunder responsibility life judiciary everyday benny aide,-0.98155,0.2086230876216968,10.09481040892193,0.3823191716862603,0,2023-12-02

CNN,New strikes hit Gaza as Israel-Hamas fighting resumes,2023-12-02 05:09:00,Chris Lau,"Civilians have flooded hospitals in Gaza following the resumption of hostilities between Israel and Hamas, further overwhelming the medical infrastructure in the war-torn territory.Most of the victims of the bombardments in Gaza since the truce ended on Friday are women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.Israel says its military strikes are targeting Hamas, not civilians.Conditions are also worsening in southern Gaza. Israel has recently started carrying out strikes there after previously concentrating military activity in the enclave’s north.“Hospitals in the southern regions of the Gaza Strip have become unable to provide medical services. The emergency department is unable to receive more casualties,” the director of the European Hospital in Khan Younis, Dr. Youssef Al-Akkad said in a statement.The seven-day Israel-Hamas truce ended on Friday after negotiations reached an impasse and Israel accused the Palestinian militant group of violating the agreement by firing at Israel.What happens next is unclear. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week vowed that Israel would fight until the end. His government had informed the United States before the truce ended that it intended eventually to turn its focus on the southern part of the enclave after fighting resumed.Washington, however, has made it clear to Israel that scale of devastation should not be repeated.Analysts say the war is bound to continue until Hamas is crushed, and it may be much fiercer this time.It is unclear if there will be another truce, but with more than 100 hostages still in Hamas captivity, it could theoretically be revived for several days if both parties agree to extend by one day for every 10 hostages released, analysts said.Read more:The Israel Defense Forces said it struck more than 400 targets across Gaza in the first 24 hours following the collapse of a week-long truce with Hamas.The targets, according to the IDF, included a weapons storage compound and terror infrastructure used by Hamas; Hamas military targets in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah in southern Gaza; a the mosque reportedly being used as a command center by another militant group, Islamic Jihad; and what the IDF said was a terrorist cell ambushing Israeli troops.The 400-plus strikes included both artillery and munitions dropped from aircraft, the IDF said.In an update late on Friday, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said 178 people have been killed, with hundreds more wounded, since Israel resumed military operations.Some context: Before the truce, the IDF said they were striking similar numbers of targets each day. The Israel military reported it carried out 300 strikes the day before the truce began.Acclaimed artist Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye is providing four million meals to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to help people in Gaza, the UN’s body has said.Tesfaye, who is a UN Goodwill Ambassador, has directed $2.5 million from his XO Humanitarian Fund towards WFP humanitarian efforts in Gaza, according to WFP’s statement Friday.The donation equates to four million emergency meals, which will fund 820 metric tons of food parcels that can feed more than 173,000 Palestinians for two weeks, it said.The WFP didn’t indicate when the aid could reach Gaza.More than one million Palestinians in Gaza are “on the verge of starvation,” WFP said, adding that since the conflict began on Oct 7, a “humanitarian catastrophe beyond reckoning” has been unleashed.Context: Tesfaye has been a Goodwill Ambassador since 2021.His XO Humanitarian Fund, which was established in partnership with WFP USA in 2022, has raised $5 million to date.The first $2.5 million of the fund went to support emergency food assistance to women and children in Ethiopia, and the rest will be allocated to the Gaza response, according to the statement.The possibility of extending the truce between Hamas and Israel collapsed after the militant group failed to provide the names of women and children to be freed, the former Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon told CNN’s Jim Acosta.Danon said that Israel may continue engaging in hostage negotiations with Hamas.Danon denied details in a New York Times report alleging that the Israeli government had knowledge of the Hamas attack a year before it happened.Some context: Israel resumed its military operation Friday after it said Hamas broke the originally agreed seven-day truce by firing rockets toward Israel. Hamas claimed Thursday that it was having trouble locating 10 women and children hostages to extend the truce. Hamas accused Israel of “refusing all offers” to extend the agreement, while Israel dismissed the charge.Israel resumed its military campaign Friday aimed at wiping out Hamas after it said the militant group broke the outline of the seven-day truce by firing rockets toward Israeli territory. The Israel Defense Forces also expanded its operations into the southern part of the enclave, prompting calls from global leaders to protect civilians.Dozens of Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Friday, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Israel maintains Hamas is embedding itself in civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and children’s playgrounds, that it uses for military purposes, making them legitimate targets.As of Friday night, negotiators are still trying to revive the truce. Hamas has said it doesn’t have any more women and children to release but Israel doesn’t believe that, according to sources familiar with the talks.Here’s what to know:Pope Francis spoke on the phone with Israeli President Isaac Herzog about the Israel-Hamas war in late October.The conversation between the pair was described as a “fraught phone call,” according to a Washinton Post report Thursday, citing a senior Israeli official familiar with the call, which has not been previously reported.Herzog was telling Francis of the unprecedented level of shock felt in Israel after the Hamas attack on October 7 when the pope said bluntly that it is “forbidden to respond to terror with terror,” according to the Post, citing the Israeli official.A Vatican source on Friday confirmed to CNN that a phone call between the Israeli president and the pope took place at the end of October, but CNN has been unable to verify that Francis used the “terror” remarks.In a statement to the Washington Post about the call, the Vatican said, “The phone call, like others in the same days, takes place in the context of the Holy Father’s efforts aimed at containing the gravity and scope of the conflict situation in the Holy Land.”A few days after his phone call with Herzog, the pope spoke to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on November 2. On October 22, Francis called United States President Joe Biden about the war.Some background: The pope has publicly described the war between Israel and Hamas as terrorism.The pope has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and is in regular contact with the Catholic community in Gaza.At least 61 journalists and media workers have been killed since the war between Israel and Hamas began on October 7, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on Friday.The deaths were overwhelmingly Palestinian journalists. CPJ said that 54 Palestinian, four Israeli, and three Lebanese journalists had been killed, according to the group’s statement.The journalism advocacy group says the latest Israel-Gaza conflict has “led to the deadliest month for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.”The latest death of a media member was Friday when Montaser Al-Sawaf, a freelance journalist working for the Turkish news agency Anadolu, was killed in an Israeli strike, the organization told CNN.The United Nations relief chief has urged for a renewed humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza as Israel resumed combat operations against Hamas on Friday.Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, warned that people in Gaza are terrified and have no safe places to go.The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that it expanded its operations into the southern part of the enclave, where it previously told civilians to take shelter.He said people also have very little food and water. The pause in fighting allowed for more humanitarian aid to cross into Gaza.Griffiths said the seven-day pause in fighting was “a glimpse of what can happen when the guns fall silent.”Khan Younis is the largest city in southern Gaza where the IDF dropped leaflets on Friday, calling it a “fighting zone” and telling residents to “evacuate immediately.” The Israeli military also named Khan Younis as one of the places its “ground, air and naval forces struck terror targets” on Friday.Griffiths also called for “progress in aid delivery” and for the protection of civilians and “life-sustaining infrastructure.”“We need the remaining hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally. We need a humanitarian ceasefire. We need the fighting to stop,” he said.The deaths of three Israeli hostages, who were kidnapped by Hamas during the brutal October 7 attacks, were confirmed by their families on Friday.The family of 70-year-old Ofra Keidar said they were informed that she had been killed while in Gaza, according to a written statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel.Keidar was kidnapped when she went out for her morning walk in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, the statement said.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum also announced it was mourning the death of Israeli hostage, Guy Illouz.Illouz, 26, was “kidnapped from the nature party in Re’im,” during the deadly attacks, the statement says.And the Kibbutz Nir Oz announced with “great sorrow” the death of one of its members, Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, 76.Margalit was married to Daphna, a father to Noa, Danny, and Nili, and a grandfather to three grandchildren, the statement says.Margalit’s 41-year-old daughter, Nilli Margalit, was also abducted and taken to Gaza during the Hamas attacks but was released on Thursday.Earlier on Friday, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari announced Eliyahu Margalit’s death.US President Joe Biden’s administration and Israeli officials believe that Hamas continues to hold several women in their 20s and 30s as hostages in Gaza — many of them kidnapped from the Nova music festival, one US official and another source familiar with the matter tell CNN.The women are of particular concern to Israel.In hostage negotiations on Thursday and in the hours after fighting resumed, Hamas insisted it did not have any more non-military female hostages to release, claiming that some of the remaining women were considered a part of the Israel Defense Forces, the sources said.Negotiations continue over the potential release of female hostages, as CNN has previously reported. An acceptable list of hostages, sources said, would lead to another pause in the fighting.Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Friday night that there are 17 women and children among the 136 hostages.At least 136 hostages are still being held in Gaza, according to the Israel Defence Forces.IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the number includes 17 women and children.The Israeli military said the body of one hostage, Ofir Tzarfati, was brought back to Israel.He was confirmed dead Thursday, with the IDF not specifying when and where Tzarfati was killed.",11527,https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-12-2-23/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231201003234-01-idf-tanks-gaza-border-113023-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/q_auto",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain ground make terrify struck urge feed palestinian herzog embed thursday accuse hour extend affair pair knowledge begin matter griffith trouble khan kill agreement back command noa partnership worker agency compound biden told ofir unclear warn official morning dismiss confirm wound administration party claimed revive equates minister parcel ministry mosque catastrophe safe infrastructure authority vowed progress refuse oz fraught ceasefire clear announce child news margalit fiercer nation statement write islamic consider anadolu grandchild insist jihad vatican pause rest sorrow chief nature spoke starvation protect nir tzarfati deadliest cell originally nili death group conflict bound phone danny defence air nova civilian weapon scale playground southern data metric deny balah member reportedly region artist resume former military wfp week european assistance strip brutal relief nilli daniel director possibility freelance particular add danon stop hold enclave outline place medical verge service defense center younis intend verify direct coordinator kidnap daughter aid daphna aircraft operation miss worsen cross keidar tesfaye city indicate believe provide described leaflet terror resumption territory support captivity munition idf committee raise flood publicly continue devastation fail focus militant eventually unprecedented gathering impasse freed pope theoretically abel israel grandfather negotiation evacuate isaac october ethiopia emergency million receive ofra casualty york november carry source establish meal eliyahu violate analyst dead lebanese president locate gun government humanitarian joe fund reach context prime terrorist strike storage resident day target great turkish conversation contact xo journalist gaza overwhelm hospital legitimate activity hostage include community oct artillery goodwill israeli programme attack level prompt spokesperson guy francis montaser lead delivery forum journalism forbidden concern cpj combat broke repeatedly time food number happen previously glimpse bluntly festival recently negotiator force rear bombardment response kibbutz truce health cnn victim youssef fight work accord engage water benjamin mourn churchill allege world report scope ambush collapse woman body acceptable brought catholic ambassador hostility effort weeknd call walk late year abduct married fire respond music wipe senior organization follow background drop hundred reckon concentrate release immediately large campaign familiar regular renew female agree overwhelmingly contain maintains night state unable washinton gravity situation holy father netanyahu medium leader part crush similar global fall zone aim allocate update hagari abbas usa potential donation washington expand naval hamas detail admiral department claim list post mahmoud deadly felt deir protection specify family offer shock held turn advocacy purpose month unconditionally friday united start inform rocket,-0.99755,0.3383360805066365,12.401830845771144,0.3054026071016362,0,2023-12-02

Mahmud Hams/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Traffic clogs the streets of Khan Younis on Friday with people seeking safety from Israeli airstrikes. TEL AVIV, Israel — For seven days, the people of Gaza could stand in long lines waiting for water, cooking gas and bread, without fear of an incoming airstrike. Hospitals could treat the injured without worrying about new strikes sending additional patients their way. Aid groups delivered tens of thousands of tons of aid across the territory, including in Gaza's north, where fighting had been too intense to safely distribute it. But on Friday, a week-long ceasefire — brokered to allow the exchange of Hamas-held hostages and Israeli-held Palestinian detainees — came to an end after both sides accused the other of violating the terms of the truce. So too did aid groups' hopes of a longer-term pause to address the worsening humanitarian situation for the 2.3 million residents of Gaza, about 80% of whom are estimated to be displaced from their homes. ""This is a man-made catastrophe. It looks like an earthquake, a famine and a massive epidemic,"" said Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, in an interview with NPR before the fighting resumed. ""The only logical answer is a true ceasefire."" The week-long pause in fighting had allowed the delivery of thousands of tons of food and water, nearly 150 tons of medical supplies and roughly 30,000 liters of fuel to shelters operated by the United Nations in the north of Gaza, the U.N. said. Ambulances ferried critically wounded patients to Egypt. The break in fighting also allowed several hospitals in northern Gaza to re-open for limited services. Officials in Gaza warned that the open hospitals would be unable to receive large numbers of wounded once fighting resumed. Nearly 20 other hospitals remained closed. Even in the south of Gaza, where some fuel and medical supplies have been more frequently delivered, medical facilities remained overwhelmed, hospital staff told NPR. ""The condition at this hospital is so bad because we are loading everything on our shoulders,"" said Dr. Mohamed Yasouri, an emergency room physician at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. ""We can save life or save organs if we have enough medical equipment,"" he added — but they don't.

But the pause did little to improve access to water for northern Gaza. A lack of fuel and damage to infrastructure kept water production facilities shut, humanitarian groups reported, leaving small U.N.- or privately-operated wells as the primary sources of potable water in the north. And the supply of other critical goods — like cooking gas — remained limited. Before the pause, about 20 trucks of aid were being delivered into Gaza each day via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. But aid organizations, including the U.N., reported that no humanitarian aid had been allowed into the territory Friday. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society, a humanitarian group, said Friday that Israeli forces had told aid groups that the entry of aid trucks from Rafah would be ""prohibited, starting from today until further notice."" ""This decision exacerbates the suffering of citizens and increases the challenges facing humanitarian and relief organizations in alleviating the hardships of citizens and displaced persons due to the ongoing aggression on the Gaza Strip,"" the group said. In response, Israeli officials said that trucks would be allowed into Gaza. The White House was also optimistic that a flow of aid would begin again, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Friday, though ""probably in terms of dozens of trucks, versus hundreds of trucks,"" he added. As many as 1.8 million Palestinians are thought to be internally displaced since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that left 1,200 dead, according to Israeli officials. In the weeks since the attack, the Israeli offensive in Gaza has resulted in at least 13,300 deaths, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and led aid groups to warn that overcrowding and deteriorating sanitary conditions are heightening the risk of infectious disease. More than a million people are registered with shelters run by UNRWA, the U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees. The shelters are designed to accommodate 1,500 people each, but currently there are, on average, about 6,000 at each one, U.N. officials say. At one UNRWA school-turned-shelter, officials reported an outbreak of hepatitis A. ""To give you an example, we're averaging 125 people using one toilet. So basic things like sanitation in these shelters is very difficult. People are jammed into very congested classrooms in the evenings,"" said Thomas White, the director of UNRWA in Gaza, in an interview with the BBC. This week, the World Health Organization warned that untreated disease could ultimately kill more people in Gaza than bombings if the territory's health infrastructure is not restored. Officials report tens of thousands of cases of respiratory infections, diarrhea and skin rash — and attributed the outbreaks to overcrowding, a lack of food, water, sanitation and basic hygiene and challenges with waste management. 1.3 million people are currently living in shelters in #Gaza. Overcrowding and lack of food, water, sanitation and basic hygiene, waste management and access to medication are resulting in a high number of cases of:- acute respiratory infections: 111,000- scabies: 12,000-… pic.twitter.com/ZhiRDodqWL ""We need a ceasefire. A ceasefire that holds,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday after the airstrikes resumed. By sundown, hundreds of strikes hit targets across Gaza, including in the south, the Israeli military reported. The Gaza Ministry of Health said nearly 180 people were killed and nearly 600 others injured. Shaimaa Ahmed, 20, a computer engineering student sheltering in central Gaza, told NPR on Friday that the renewed fighting felt ""suffocating.""

CNN,North Korea says any US interference with its ‘space assets’ will be deemed ‘declaration of war’,2023-12-02 02:30:00,Akanksha Sharma,"North Korea has warned any potential interference or attack on its “space assets” by the United States will be “deemed a declaration of war,” the state media outlet KCNA reported on Saturday.“The US Space Force’s deplorable hostility toward the DPRK’s reconnaissance satellite can never be overlooked as it is just a challenge to the sovereignty of the DPRK, and more exactly, a declaration of war against it,” the country’s defense ministry said in a statement reported by KCNA.DPRK stands for Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea.The warning came less than two weeks after Pyongyang said it had put its first spy satellite into space, in a move which analysts predicted could enable the country to more accurately target opponents’ forces, if the spacecraft works.Neither South Korea, the United States nor Japan, all of which are experiencing increasing military tensions with North Korea, could confirm “Malligyong-1,” had made it into orbit.Just days after the North Korean launch, the South sent its own first spy satellite into orbit with the help of space company SpaceX.The KCNA report claimed that Pyongyang’s warning followed an alleged comment from a US Space Command official who “spouted rubbish hinting at a military attack on the DPRK’s reconnaissance satellite.”KCNA said that the unnamed American official allegedly claimed the US “can decrease the enemy country’s outer space operation capabilities” by employing “diverse reversible and irreversible methods.”It’s unclear who that US official may be.CNN has not been able to find or verify any such comment made by any US official recently.Pyongyang says its satellite is for reconnaissance and “is not regarded as a space weapon by international law for its technical features aimed at observation.”However, analysts claim the spacecraft is meant for spying and increasing North Korea’s military capabilities.In response to the November 21 launch, the US Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Thursday sanctioned eight foreign-based DPRK agents “that facilitate sanctions evasion, including revenue generation and missile-related technology procurement that support the DPRK’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs.”It also sanctioned what it called a cyber espionage group called Kimsuky for “gathering intelligence to support the DPRK’s strategic objectives,” according to a statement on the Treasury Department’s website.The November launch was condemned by North Korea’s neighbors Japan and South Korea, with Seoul calling it a “clear violation” of a UN Security Council resolution that prohibits North Korea from using ballistic missile technology.However, Pyongyang warned that if its reconnaissance satellite is regarded as a “military threat” that “must be gotten rid of” then it should also destroy “countless spy satellites of the US flying above the Korean peninsula region every day, exclusively tasked with monitoring the major strategic spots of the DPRK.”It also called the US “chief culprit of evils” for allegedly turning space “into a theater of war.”Pyongyang’s move has led the South Korean government to partially suspend an agreement it had with North Korea that limited the South’s reconnaissance and surveillance activities along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two countries.North Korea subsequently vowed to deploy new military hardware along the military demarcation

CNN,A Venezuelan vote on an oil-rich region of Guyana raises concerns of a South American military conflict,2023-12-02 00:17:00,David Shortell,"Venezuelans will vote Sunday in a referendum to decide whether the country should create its own state within a large swath of its oil-rich neighbor Guyana – a move that has been denounced by Guyana as a step towards annexation and raised concerns of a possible military conflict between the two South American nations.The area in question, the densely forested Essequibo region, amounts to about two-thirds of Guyana’s national territory and is roughly the size of Florida. Venezuela has long claimed the land, which it argues was within its borders during the Spanish colonial period. It dismisses an 1899 ruling by international arbitrators that set the current boundaries when Guyana was still a British colony. The recent discovery of vast offshore oil fields in the region has heightened the stakes of the dispute.In campaign rallies and a stream of patriotic social media posts, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has cast the referendum in anti-imperialist sentiment, arguing that Venezuela’s historic rights to the region have been unfairly rejected.Guyana has said the threat of annexation is “existential.”Among the questions posed to voters on Sunday: do you agree with creating a new state in the Essequibo region, providing its population with Venezuelan citizenship, and “incorporating that state into the map of Venezuelan territory?”The practical implications of the vote – widely expected to go in favor of the government’s position – however, are minimal, analysts say, with the creation of a Venezuelan state within the Essequibo a remote possibility. It’s unclear what steps the Venezuelan government would take to follow through on the result, and any attempt to assert a claim would certainly be met with international resistance.Still, the escalating rhetoric has prompted troop movements in the region and saber-rattling in both countries, drawing comparisons from Guyanese leaders to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many residents in the predominantly indigenous region are reportedly on edge.“The longstanding row over the border between Guyana and Venezuela has risen to a level of unprecedented tension in the relations between our countries,” Guyanese Foreign Minister Robert Persaud wrote Wednesday in Americas Quarterly.The International Court of Justice, based in The Hague, ruled on Friday that “Venezuela shall refrain from taking any action which would modify the situation that currently prevails in the territory in dispute” after a request to halt the vote from Guyana, which argued annexation would be unlawful. But officials in Venezuela have said the referendum will take place regardless of the court’s decision.The international court has been reviewing the territorial dispute since 2018 and will hold a trial in the spring, following decades of failed negotiations between the two countries through the UN. Guyana says the court is the correct venue for resolving the dispute, while Venezuela doesn’t recognize the court’s jurisdiction on the issue.The standing borders of the Essequibo date to an 1899 ruling by an international tribune in Paris, which granted what was then known as British Guiana most of the land between the Orinoco and Essequibo rivers.Venezuela respected the ruling until 1962, as the British colony moved toward independence, alleging fraud within the tribunal. A 1966 agreement, signed shortly before Guyana’s independence, paved the way for country-to-country talks on the disputed zone and the eventual involvement of the International Court of Justice, which has been slow-moving.Guyana, a sparsely populated country of about 800,000 with high rates of poverty, has seen rapid transformation since the 2015 discovery of oil off the coast of the Essequibo region by ExxonMobil, with over $1 billion in annual government oil revenue fueling massive infrastructure projects. The country is set to surpass the oil production of Venezuela, long dependent on its own oil reserves, and is on track to become the world’s highest per capita oil producer.Venezuela says Guyana does not have the right to grant concessions for drilling in the offshore reserves and has called Guyana a tool of ExxonMobil. “ExxonMobil owns the government of Guyana. It owns the congress of Guyana,” Maduro told supporters last week.Even without creating a state within the disputed territory, which would require further constitutional steps and the likely use of force, Maduro stands to gain politically from the referendum amid a challenging re-election campaign. In October, the Venezuelan opposition showed rare momentum after rallying around Maria Corina Machado, a center-right former legislator who has attacked Maduro for overseeing soaring inflation and food shortages, in the country’s first primary in 11 years.“An authoritarian government facing a difficult political situation is always tempted to look around for a patriotic issue so it can wrap itself in the flag and rally support, and I think that’s a large part of what Maduro is doing,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst with the International Crisis Group.Ahead of the vote, both Venezuela and Guyana have raised the specter of armed conflict over the region: last week, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali visited troops in the Essequibo region and dramatically hoisted a flag on a mountain overlooking the border with Venezuela. “This is not an armed war, for now,” the Venezuelan defense minister responded. The Venezuelan military has also said that the country is moving to build an airstrip to serve as a “logistical support point for the integral development of the Essequibo.”On Wednesday, Brazil announced that it was increasing its military presence with “defensive actions” along its northern border with Venezuela and Guyana.Writing for Foreign Policy last year, ahead of the announcement of the referendum, Paul J. Angelo of the Council on Foreign Relations and Wazim Mowla, the assistant director for the Caribbean Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, called the border dispute a “powder keg,” arguing that Russian President Vladmir Putin’s “defiance of international norms” with the invasion of Ukraine “could give new wings to Maduro’s territorial ambitions.”Guyanese Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo echoed the comparison at a news conference last week.“I don’t know if they are miscalculating based on what happened in Crimea and other places, but it would be a grave miscalculation on their part,” Jagdeo said.“We can’t just think that this is internal politics (in Venezuela) without taking all possible measures to protect our country, including working with others,” he added, citing a visit last week by US military officials to discuss ongoing joint training exercises.Gunson, of the International Crisis Group, said he believes that without the backing of any of its allies, Venezuela has no intention of invading the Essequibo. But as domestic pressure will likely increase on Maduro to act on the results of the referendum, especially in the lead-up to the presidential election next year, Maduro might be tempted to provoke skirmishes along the border, he said.“The belligerence is on both sides of the border, and since neither of them can afford to back down, that’s where you get into the slightly dangerous territory of potential military clashes,” Gunson said.",7346,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/americas/venezuela-essequibo-referendum-guyana-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171201182235-david-shortell-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,sentiment fraud national base pave venezuelan voter concern request center large guiana medium venezuela social action council adrienne miscalculate south creation visit ally unfairly initiative invasion population arm populate stand assert hague keg crimea claimed act hoist refrain director predominantly foreign ongoing momentum practical potential especially soar spanish historic crisis sparsely attempt american current call october reserve back domestic presidential heighten leader official political unlawful neighbor rule shortage miscalculation pressure paris rapid maria expect agreement powder forest annexation difficult backing defense situation high comparison bharrat grant stream announcement exxonmobil persaud force overlook vice hold country supporter wing maduro side announce give dramatically primary infrastructure widely russian date point phil recognize legislator massive land week long stake surpass prevails set rate dispute minister congress amid negotiation defensive troop possible government training florida wazim presence oversee president incorporate possibility happen latin essequibo agree assistant arsht resolve dependent concession rally step provide venue news world relation zone jagdeo mowla indigenous talk discovery work level increase independence attack revenue machado reportedly part vote corina size longstanding production fail paul track modify drilling defiance movement resident post measure region airstrip guyana question unprecedented jurisdiction northern brazil allege politics issue conference belligerence denounce analyst inflation field minimal state echoed project decide gunson halt constitutional angelo shortly argue guyanese tool protect group campaign authoritarian row colony fuel annual coast place putin poverty territorial patriotic dismisses robert court believe result ahead vast write development review wrap british prompt swath nicolas involvement challenge cast raise argues year opposition risen territory slightly remote irfaan move conflict amount caput recent offshore colonial tribunal skirmish area add international roughly discus grave specter ruling joint ukraine build america unclear correct map require spring logistical sunday flag currently implication integral rare trial support norm citizenship densely orinoco policy border create referendum tribune decade afford position military favor wednesday show tension respond threat clash sign tempt caribbean draw mountain follow dangerous transformation politically internal respect vladmir include provoke told escalate atlantic food pose serve former election eventual boundary intention claim justice friday rhetoric invade period arbitrator billion oil,-0.96265,0.2858698611489245,12.18795965865012,0.341897546897547,0,2023-12-02
CNN,"December 1, 2023 Israel-Hamas war",2023-12-02 00:05:00,Tara Subramaniam,"Our coverage of the Israel-Hamas war has moved here.Pope Francis spoke on the phone with Israeli President Isaac Herzog about the Israel-Hamas war in late October.The conversation between the pair was described as a “fraught phone call,” according to a Washinton Post report Thursday, citing a senior Israeli official familiar with the call, which has not been previously reported.Herzog was telling Francis of the unprecedented level of shock felt in Israel after the Hamas attack on October 7 when the pope said bluntly that it is “forbidden to respond to terror with terror,” according to the Post, citing the Israeli official.A Vatican source on Friday confirmed to CNN that a phone call between the Israeli president and the pope took place at the end of October, but CNN has been unable to verify that Francis used the “terror” remarks.In a statement to the Washington Post about the call, the Vatican said, “The phone call, like others in the same days, takes place in the context of the Holy Father’s efforts aimed at containing the gravity and scope of the conflict situation in the Holy Land.”A few days after his phone call with Herzog, the pope spoke to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on November 2. On October 22, Francis called United States President Joe Biden about the war.Some background: The pope has publicly described the war between Israel and Hamas as terrorism.The pope has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and is in regular contact with the Catholic community in Gaza.At least 61 journalists and media workers have been killed since the war between Israel and Hamas began on October 7, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on Friday.The deaths were overwhelmingly Palestinian journalists. CPJ said that 54 Palestinian, four Israeli, and three Lebanese journalists had been killed, according to the group’s statement.The journalism advocacy group says the latest Israel-Gaza conflict has “led to the deadliest month for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.”The latest death of a media member was Friday when Montaser Al-Sawaf, a freelance journalist working for the Turkish news agency Anadolu, was killed in an Israeli strike, the organization told CNN.The United Nations relief chief has urged for a renewed humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza as Israel resumed combat operations against Hamas on Friday.Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, warned that people in Gaza are terrified and have no safe places to go.The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that it expanded its operations into the southern part of the enclave, where it previously told civilians to take shelter.He said people also have very little food and water. The pause in fighting allowed for more humanitarian aid to cross into Gaza.Griffiths said the seven-day pause in fighting was “a glimpse of what can happen when the guns fall silent.”Khan Younis is the largest city in southern Gaza where the IDF dropped leaflets on Friday, calling it a “fighting zone” and telling residents to “evacuate immediately.” The Israeli military also named Khan Younis as one of the places its “ground, air and naval forces struck terror targets” on Friday.Griffiths also called for “progress in aid delivery” and for the protection of civilians and “life-sustaining infrastructure.”“We need the remaining hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally. We need a humanitarian ceasefire. We need the fighting to stop,” he said.The deaths of three Israeli hostages, who were kidnapped by Hamas during the brutal October 7 attacks, were confirmed by their families on Friday.The family of 70-year-old Ofra Keidar said they were informed that she had been killed while in Gaza, according to a written statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel.Keidar was kidnapped when she went out for her morning walk in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, the statement said.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum also announced it was mourning the death of Israeli hostage, Guy Illouz.Illouz, 26, was “kidnapped from the nature party in Re’im,” during the deadly attacks, the statement says.And the Kibbutz Nir Oz announced with “great sorrow” the death of one of its members, Eliyahu (Churchill) Margalit, 76.Margalit was married to Daphna, a father to Noa, Danny, and Nili, and a grandfather to three grandchildren, the statement says.Margalit’s 41-year-old daughter, Nilli Margalit, was also abducted and taken to Gaza during the Hamas attacks but was released on Thursday.Earlier on Friday, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari announced Eliyahu Margalit’s death.Israel resumed its military campaign Friday aimed at wiping out Hamas after it said the militant group broke the outline of the seven-day truce by firing rockets toward Israeli territory. The Israel Defense Forces also expanded its operations into the southern part of the enclave, prompting calls from global leaders to protect civilians.Dozens of Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Friday, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Israel maintains Hamas is embedding itself in civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and children’s playgrounds, that it uses for military purposes, making them legitimate targets.As of Friday night, negotiators are still trying to revive the truce. Hamas has said it doesn’t have any more women and children to release but Israel doesn’t believe that, according to sources familiar with the talks.Here’s what to know:US President Joe Biden’s administration and Israeli officials believe that Hamas continues to hold several women in their 20s and 30s as hostages in Gaza — many of them kidnapped from the Nova music festival, one US official and another source familiar with the matter tell CNN.The women are of particular concern to Israel.In hostage negotiations on Thursday and in the hours after fighting resumed, Hamas insisted it did not have any more non-military female hostages to release, claiming that some of the remaining women were considered a part of the Israel Defense Forces, the sources said.Negotiations continue over the potential release of female hostages, as CNN has previously reported. An acceptable list of hostages, sources said, would lead to another pause in the fighting.Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Friday night that there are 17 women and children among the 136 hostages.The post was updated with the latest IDF estimate on hostages held in Gaza.A freelance journalist working for Turkish news agency Anadolu was killed in Gaza on Friday, as Israeli airstrikes resumed after a one-week pause, the Anadolu News Agency told CNN.Montaser Al-Sawaf was a freelance cameraman based in the Gaza Strip and had recently recovered from injuries sustained from another Israeli airstrike in November before the start of the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas.Enes Canli, Anadolu’s bureau chief in Jerusalem, told CNN that Al-Sawaf had lost both his parents and other family members in a previous airstrike.The journalist sustained more serious injuries Friday and had to wait for an ambulance for about half an hour before he was transported to the Al-Ahli Baptist hospital, where he later died, the bureau chief said.Canli remembered Al-Sawaf as a quiet and brave man, calling him “a really gentle soul. He was a calm person and hardworking, always over-delivering and over-delivering, even if you don’t ask him.”He leaves behind two young children, he added.According to Canli, Al-Sawaf wanted to stay in the city center, considering it a “personal case” to tell the world about the conditions in Gaza and “not just journalism.”In one of his most recent posts on Instagram, Al-Sawaf posted a picture of his bloodied and injured face, with one eye completely shut.Some context: Israel’s war with Hamas, which controls Gaza, has been the deadliest for journalists in decades, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. At least 57 journalists have been killed since October, the journalist advocacy organization said on November 25, including 50 Palestinian, four Israeli, and three Lebanese journalists.In November, Palestine TV correspondent Mohammad Abu Hattab was killed along with 11 members of his family. Palestine TV said he was killed by an Israeli airstrike, while Israeli authorities said their forces were not operating in the area.At least 136 hostages are still being held in Gaza, according to the Israel Defence Forces.IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the number includes 17 women and children.The Israeli military said the body of one hostage, Ofir Tzarfati, was brought back to Israel.He was confirmed dead Thursday, with the IDF not specifying when and where Tzarfati was killed.National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby declined to say if the US has seen more deliberate targeting from Israel since following the expiration of the truce early Friday.“I’m just not going to armchair quarterback,” he told CNN’s MJ Lee.Kirby also declined to weigh in on reports from Gaza’s Hamas-run Ministry of Health that Israeli strikes have killed more than 100 Palestinians since the truce expired.Thousands of people have been killed in Gaza since the Israel-Hamas war began, many of them civilians, including women and children. Since the end of the truce and the resumption of fighting, Israel is facing increased pressure to employ more calculated techniques to minimize civilian casualties in the next stage of the war.Hamas battle plans: Kirby also said that the White House was “not in a position” to confirm details reported by The New York Times about Hamas’s battle plans.On Friday, the Times reported that Israeli officials had obtained a document describing Hamas’ battle plan for its October 7 terror attack more than a year before the militant group carried out the surprise assault. Officials reportedly dismissed the plan, assessing it as too difficult for Hamas to execute, according to the Times.Humanitarian aid: Kirby called reports that trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza have resumed “a good sign going forward.”He acknowledged that less aid is being allowed in than during the truce, and said the US is urging Israel to get aid deliveries back at the levels “we reached during the pause.”Still, Kirby laid blame for the pause in aid ultimately at Hamas’ feet, reiterating that Hamas is responsible for the truce ending.New pictures show sister and brother – Maya and Itay Regev – reuniting Thursday after they had been taken hostage by Hamas at the Nova music festival on October 7.Maya can be seen touching her brother’s face during their reunion and smiling while leaning into Itay, as he buries his face in his hand and his mother hugs him, in photos shared by the Soroka Medical Center.Maya had been released on Sunday while Itay was released on Wednesday. It is unclear whether the siblings had been held together for any period during their captivity.In an interview with CNN, their father Ilan replayed a terrifying call Maya had placed the day of the attack.After Maya’s release, Soroka Hospital and Israel’s Ministry of Health said in a statement that she was in stable condition and her injury was not life-threatening.In a video posted earlier this week, before Itay’s release, their mother, Mirit Regev, ran to hug Maya after she arrived at the hospital. Maya can be heard sobbing while she embraces her family after being held in captivity for 51 days.More than 260 Palestinians were detained by Israeli forces in the West Bank during the period of the now-expired truce, according to the Palestinian Prisoner Society.The group has revised the number of arrests several times this week. The IDF has publicly acknowledged at least 100 arrests during the truce through press releases.In a subsequent update, the society and the Commission of Detainees’ Affairs said 12 more were arrested on Friday.“Accordingly, 3,400 arrest cases have been recorded since October 7, including those who were arrested from their homes, checkpoints and others who surrendered themselves under threat and held as hostages,” the joint statement said.The IDF said Friday that since the beginning of the war, 2,100 Palestinians in the West Bank had been arrested – 1,100 of whom it says had ties to Hamas.Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for Israel to back out of the hostage negotiations and cut all contact with Hamas and mediators.The Israeli government should only look at the enemy through a military lens until Hamas is completely destroyed and the remaining hostages are returned, Smotrich said in a Hebrew-language post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.“We are very glad to have hostages returning, but now the pause frameworks has been exhausted,” Smotrich wrote in his post.More on Smotrich: Smotrich is head of the far-right Religious Zionism party and has been a controversial figure in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Earlier this year, the US State Department harshly condemned controversial comments by Smotrich calling for a Palestinian town “to be erased” after it was attacked by Israeli settlers. He has also denied the existence of a Palestinian people and the right of Palestinians to statehood.Smotrich also holds a supervisory role responsible for Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which are considered illegal by much of the international community. He voted in support of the original truce agreement after initially speaking out against it.Qatar, which has played a key role in negotiations between Israel and Hamas, expressed its deep regret at the renewed “Israeli aggression” on Gaza following the expiration of the humanitarian truce.Qatar vowed to take all necessary measures to restore calm.The ministry said negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides are continuing with the aim of returning to a state of truce.Qatar condemns all forms of targeting civilians, collective punishment and attempts to forcibly displace Gaza residents, the ministry said.An Israeli singer has released a music video highlighting what she describes as “silence” from the United Nations over violence against women by Hamas militants during their October 7 attack on Israel.Gal De Paz’s song “Bring Them Home” calls for the return of hostages still held by Hamas and focuses on violence against women and girls during the attacks and in the weeks since.“It is unperceivable, unbelievable, what is happening here; the world won’t see it but we can feel it. We hear it and see it everywhere,” De Paz sings.And she criticizes the UN Women organization for apparent inaction.Last week the body’s Executive Director Sima Bahous told the UN Security Council that “every act of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence, is unequivocally condemned, and must be fully investigated.”“Each day that passes marks another 24 hours of unspeakable fear and uncertainty for the hostages, including the women and girls held by Hamas,” Bahous said.De Paz’s video depicts pictures of kidnapped women and children, and also features female singers handcuffed and gagged to symbolize the hostages’ situation.Some context: Hamas has released dozens of hostages in recent days under a deal with Israel, most of them women and children, but more than 100 remain in captivity.The “nightmare” for civilians caught in the Israel-Hamas war has returned as fighting has picked up again, Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told CNN Friday.Mardini emphasized the importance of holding out hope for another truce.“We need to keep the hope alive. Let’s not forget that there has been seven full days of truce,” he said. “That was a glimmer of hope. That was humanity prevailing in the midst of chaos and conflict. It is also international humanitarian law in action when these operations can take place following a negotiation between the parties.”The director-general also said both sides in the conflict “must work harder to protect civilians, because it is their obligation, period.”On hostages: The ICRC has played a crucial role in the delicate process of handing over hostages held by Hamas to Israeli authorities. Mardini described the process as “a very simple operation because it is facilitating the transfer, but at the same time it is very complex, because at every step of the way it can derail, because every single detail is part and parcel of negotiations between the parties.”“And our teams have to implement those negotiations in a very disciplined way,” he added.He also commended the work of his team on the ground in Gaza. “A lot of credit should go to them today,” he said.The ICRC staff and volunteers are “caught between a rock and a hard place,” as they face the same challenges as civilians and are in the line of fire, he said.As fighting resumes in the Israel-Hamas war, both sides continue to negotiate through mediators over the potential release of hostages from Gaza, which would prompt another pause in hostilities, three sources familiar with the discussions said.The negotiating parties — Israel and Hamas, in consultation with Qatar, the US and Egypt — are still discussing the release of the rest of the women hostages, one of the sources said.There is an understanding that a Hamas list of captives deemed acceptable by Israel would bring back the truce, according to those sources. There are 17 women and children among the 136 Hamas hostages remaining in Gaza, according to the latest tally from the Israel Defense Forces, which varies based on the most recent intelligence.If and when what is presumed to be the last group of remaining civilian women were to be successfully released, the parameters of the negotiations would quickly turn to another categories of hostages: civilian men, as well as military reservists — both male and female, two sources said.Some background: Over the course of the negotiations that stretched into early Friday and past the truce expiration deadline, Hamas failed to produce a list of hostages that Israeli officials could accept, sources said. In particular, one source said, there has been a fraught back-and-forth over Hamas’ claims that some of the women they are holding captive are soldiers – which Israel rejects.Hamas has previously argued that women under 45 should be considered reservists and not civilians, according to a person familiar with the talks. Most of the women still being held hostage are under the age of 45, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.Hamas has claimed they do not have more women and children in their custody to release, suggesting those remaining may be in the hands of other groups. Under the previous agreement, Hamas had to release 10 women and children hostages for each day of the truce, with three Palestinians released from Israeli prisons for each hostage.This post has been updated with the latest statistics on hostages provided by the IDF.A fighter for Hezbollah and his mother have been killed in Israeli shelling of a Lebanese area near the border with Israel, Hezbollah and Lebanon’s National News Agency said.Lebanon’s National News Agency said two civilians were killed, while Hezbollah later said on Telegram that one of its fighters was among those killed. The name from NNA matches up with Hezbollah’s quote.The Israel Defense Forces said it struck back at sources of launches coming from Lebanon toward IDF posts in northern Israel, and it intercepted two launches from Lebanon toward the Israeli border area of Kiryat Shmona.“An additional IDF aircraft struck a terrorist cell in the area of Malkia that attempted to fire toward Israel,” the IDF said in a separate statement.Hezbollah-backed Al-Manar TV said a woman and her son were killed in Houla in southern Lebanon after their house was hit by an artillery shell. That town faces the Israeli community of Margaliot.More background: On Thursday, Israel’s Iron Dome successfully intercepted an “aerial target” launched from Lebanon, the IDF said.On Wednesday, the US ambassador to the United Nations said Washington continues to be concerned about a spillover of the Gaza conflict into Lebanon.“Escalation would have grave implications for regional peace and security, and for the well-being of the Lebanese people. Restoring calm along the Israel-Lebanon border is of utmost importance,” Amb. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during her address to the UN security briefing.This post has been updated. An earlier version of this post said two civilians were killed during shelling near the border, according to the National News Agency in Lebanon. Hezbollah has since announced that one of its fighters was among the two killed.Hours after Israel announced it was restarting its offensive against Hamas early Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters it was “important to understand” that the seven-day pause in fighting in Gaza came to an end “because of Hamas.”The Israel Defense Forces has accused Hamas of violating the truce first by firing rockets toward Israeli territory.On Gaza civilians: Blinken, who boarded his plane to leave Israel moments after the IDF announced it would resume fighting, also said Friday that he has already seen Israel “take steps immediately today” to protect civilians from its renewed operations.Those steps included the IDF’s efforts to “get information to people about where safe areas are, how they can get out of harm’s way,” Blinken told reporters in Dubai before boarding a flight back to the US.The IDF dropped leaflets in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis Friday, calling it a “fighting zone” and telling residents to “evacuate immediately.” The leaflets included a QR code that connects to a map; however, extensive damage to telecommunications and power infrastructure in Gaza has left many residents without access to the internet.More context: In the hours before the latest fighting erupted, the United States ramped up its pressure on Israel to shield Palestinian civilians.Blinken laid out American requirements in private talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet, while also making the US position clear in public statements.The IDF said Friday that new combat operations will include southern parts of the strip, where it previously told civilians to take shelter.CNN’s Stephen Collinson contributed reporting to this post.Some of the areas where Israel is conducting offensive operations in Gaza, after a truce with Hamas expired, include southern parts of the strip, the Israel Defense Forces said Friday.“Over the last few hours, ground, air and naval forces struck terror targets in the north and south of the Gaza Strip, including in Khan Yunis and Rafah,” the IDF said.Over 200 targets have been struck since 7 a.m. local time (12 a.m. ET), the IDF said. The targets included “areas booby-trapped with explosives, terror tunnel shafts, launch posts, and operational command centres designated by Hamas for use in the renewed fighting,” according to the military.“Widening the framework”: In a video statement on Friday, Israel war cabinet member and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Israel had “prepared for widening the framework” in order to bring the remaining hostages home.“Especially this week, I thought of those that haven’t yet returned. I met and spoke to several of the families of the abductees that haven’t yet returned, and today when we again attack, I want to stress that we are also fighting for them,” he said.Gantz reiterated that “this victory also foremost includes the effort to return the hostages, as well as eliminating the threat from Hamas.”IDF drops evacuation leaflets: The military released a new interactive map showing Gaza divided up into hundreds of numbered districts showing “evacuation zones” to be used in the “next stage of the war.”The IDF said the new map was meant to reduce casualties when it carries out strikes in civilian areas where it says Hamas has placed military infrastructure.Earlier Friday, the IDF dropped leaflets in the southern city of Khan Younis, calling it a “fighting zone” and telling residents to evacuate. The leaflets included a QR code that connects to a map when scanned; however, extensive damage to telecommunications and power infrastructure in Gaza has left many residents without access to the internet.Israel’s Iron Dome defense system intercepted incoming rockets near Tel Aviv early Friday evening local time, according to CNN staff in the area.The sound of booms from the interceptions came soon after the Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing, said on social media it was targeting Tel Aviv.It is the first rocket fire toward the Israeli city since a truce between Israel and Hamas broke down Friday morning.Displaced Gazans expressed frustration after the Israel Defense Forces dropped leaflets in the southern city of Khan Younis on Friday that called the area a “fighting zone” and told residents to “evacuate immediately.”Displaced Gazan Ghassan Al-Qudra told Reuters on Friday he had originally left Al-Qarara village and traveled further south to Khan Younis.“All of a sudden, after the temporary truce, they (Israel) came up with new orders telling us that the people from Al-Qarara, Habathan and al-Fuzaa, had to leave to Rafah,” said Al-Qudra.Displaced mother Salma Mohamed Ben Suhaila also spoke to Reuters.“We were in our home and everything was calm and all of the sudden they told us to go to Rafah. Where are we supposed to go? We can’t, they are forcing us to leave,” she said.“They are lying to us. Who are these unjust people? They are unjust,” she added.More context: The IDF dropped leaflets in areas of southern Gaza that included a QR code that connects an interactive map showing Gaza divided up into hundreds of numbered districts showing “evacuation zones.”But telecommunications and electrical infrastructure in Gaza suffered extensive damage over the course of weeks of bombardment between October 7 and the start of the temporary truce on November 24, leaving many residents with unreliable access to the internet and power.Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7 left Israel flat-footed, sparking a backlash that is still rippling through the country.The operation saw at least 1,500 Hamas fighters pour across the border into Israel, in an assault that killed at least 1,200 Israelis, while others are still held hostage by the militant group.But a report from the New York Times claimed Israel obtained Hamas’ plan for the attack more than a year in advance.The report says Israeli officials dismissed the plan as aspirational and deemed it too complex for the group to carry out. Other outlets, including Israeli newspaper Haaretz, have also reported the claim.What did Israel reportedly know about the attack?: Israeli officials obtained a document describing Hamas’ battle plan for its October 7 terror attack more than a year before the militant group carried out the assault, the New York Times reported Thursday, citing documents, emails and interviews.The roughly 40-page document did not give a date for the attack, but outlined “point by point” the kind of deadly incursion that Hamas carried out in Israeli territory in October, according to the Times, which reviewed the translated document.Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan, assessing that it would be too difficult for Hamas to carry out, according to the Times.The document, which the Israeli authorities code-named “Jericho Wall,” detailed an assault that would overwhelm fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and target key military bases. It was followed with precision by Hamas on October 7, the Times said.On that day, Hamas militants struck across the border from Gaza in a coordinated assault in what was the deadliest single-day assault on Israel since the country’s founding in 1948.Read more about Hamas’ October 7 attack here.The seven-day Israel-Hamas truce ended on Friday after negotiations reached an impasse and Israel accused the Palestinian militant group of violating the agreement by firing at Israel.The nearly eight-week war that preceded the lull in fighting caused widespread destruction and saw more than 14,800 people killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank, which draws its data from Hamas-run health authorities in the Gaza Strip. For the next round of fighting, however, the United States has made it clear to Israel that scale of devastation should not be repeated.Whether Israel will listen is a different matter. Analysts say the war is bound to continue until Hamas is crushed, and it may be much fiercer this time.Benny Gantz, who is part of the war cabinet, said Wednesday the fighting would “expand to wherever it is needed throughout the Strip. There will be no cities of refuge.”It is unclear if there will be another truce, but with more than 100 hostages still in Hamas captivity, it could theoretically be revived for several days if both parties agree to extend by one day for every 10 hostages released, analysts said.Meanwhile, the US is piling pressure on Israel to avoid mass civilian casualties in the next rounds of fighting.Read Ebrahim’s analysis of the Israel-Hamas war here.Hamas and Israel are still talking indirectly about hostages and the US believes a pause could resume as soon as Friday, according to a senior State Department official traveling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.Blinken boarded his plane to leave Israel moments after the IDF announced a resumption of the fighting.On the flight, according to the pool traveling with him, the senior official told journalists that the discussions continue despite the fact that Hamas did not hand over the expected list of hostages to be released on an eighth day of pause, which has so far not materialized.In a statement released from his office, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said fighting resumed against Hamas in Gaza after the group broke the outline of the truce and “didn’t respect its obligation to release today all the abducted women and launched rockets towards the citizens of Israel.”Hamas has said it doesn’t have any more women and children to release but Israel doesn’t believe that, the State Department official said.Iran’s delegation to COP28, headed by Energy Minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian, left the climate summit in Dubai on Friday in protest over the presence of Israeli officials, according to state media IRNA.“The delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran left COP28 because it considers the political, biased and irrelevant presence of the fake Zionist regime as contrary to the goals and aims of the climate change conference,” Mehrabian said.IRNA quoted Mehrabian as saying Iran “intended to use the opportunity to attend COP28 to discuss climate conditions, negotiate with the authorities and delegations of different countries and defend the oppressed Palestinian nation.”Iran does not recognize the state of Israel and is one of Hamas’ most prominent supporters.Israel’s President Isaac Herzog is expected to speak at the event.Jordan condemned the “resumption of the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip” and called for an immediate ceasefire, in a statement released Friday by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Ministry spokesperson Sufyan Al-Qudah “called on the international community to assume its responsibility and to deter Israel from committing more crimes against civilians.”Israel maintains it is targeting Hamas and that the terror group is embedding itself in civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and children’s playgrounds, that it uses for military purposes, making them legitimate targets.Al-Qudah “further emphasised the importance of upholding international law and international humanitarian law and the urgency of providing international protection for the Palestinian people.”He also “renewed his appeal to the international community to act immediately to impose a ceasefire,” according to the statement.Jordan’s King Abdullah II had previously called for a ceasefire in Gaza and had described Israel’s bombardment of the enclave as “cruel and unconscionable.”Queen Rania Al Abdullah told CNN in early November that civilians in Gaza are experiencing an “avalanche of suffering.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released a new interactive map showing Gaza divided up into hundreds of numbered districts showing “evacuation zones” to be used in the “next stage of the war,” after the truce agreement expired and fighting restarted Friday.The IDF said the new map was meant to reduce casualties when it carries out strikes in civilian areas where it says Hamas has placed military infrastructure.It published statements in English, Arabic and Hebrew on its social media accounts and via a leaflet drop.Earlier on Friday the IDF dropped leaflets in areas of southern Gaza which included a QR code that connects to the map when scanned.But telecommunications and electrical infrastructure in Gaza suffered extensive damage over the course of weeks of bombardment between October 7 and the start of the temporary truce on November 24, leaving many residents with unreliable access to the internet and power.The UN estimates up to 1.8 million people in Gaza, or nearly 80 percent of the population, are internally displaced, having already had to leave their homes.As a medical social worker at Israel’s Kaplan Hospital, Prof. Shir Daphna-Tekoah is no stranger to trauma.But when she was drafted in to work on October 7, the day Hamas attacked Israeli farms, villages and a music festival, the scale of the disaster quickly became apparent.“I’ve seen dozens of people killed in accidents or shootings, but this was the hardest thing I’ve done in my life,” Daphna-Tekoah told CNN by telephone.As head of the hospital’s rape crisis center, she was called in as reports surfaced of sexual assaults. But it was soon all hands on deck as the emergency room filled up with the injured.It was Daphna-Tekoah’s responsibility to support the families saying goodbye to their murdered loved ones. Of one family, she said: “I asked if they would like to thank their child or ask for forgiveness for anything.“The mother said: ‘I’m so sorry I let you go to the party and that I didn’t protect you.’”Then, Daphna-Tekoah posed another question. “I asked ‘Would you like me to find out about sperm preservation?’”Daphna-Tekoah immediately approached hospital management, and just a few hours later they had the legal sign-off needed. By the following morning, the sperm of several victims from the Nova festival had been retrieved.Now, more than seven weeks later, Israeli hospitals have been inundated with requests to cryogenically freeze the sperm of those killed in the conflict, hospital officials say.Read the full story here:The situation in Gaza is “beyond crisis point” and the resumption of fighting is “catastrophic,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said Friday.Türk said recent comments from Israeli leaders indicating their plans to expand and intensify their military offensive is “troubling.”The UN representative called for the release of all remaining hostages, the cessation of indiscriminate rocket fire, and concrete steps to prevent further disaster.Israel’s military restarted fighting against Hamas in Gaza after a week-long truce broke down on Friday.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had “resumed combat operations” and accused Hamas of violating the truce first by firing rockets toward Israeli territory.The resumption marks the end of a brittle truce between the warring parties that saw scores of Israeli hostages released from Gaza, and Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli jails.It could also mark the start of an expansion of Israel’s military operations in Gaza, as it turns its attention to Hamas fighters in the south.Here are the latest developments:Israel believes there are still 137 people taken by Hamas on October 7 who are being held hostage in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Friday.Of those abductees, 117 are men and 20 are women, the statement said.Among them are 126 Israelis and 11 foreigners (eight Thai nationals, one Nepali citizen, one from Tanzania and one dual France-Mexico national).Two children under the age of 18, and 10 people aged 75 and older are also among Israeli count.The remains of two abductees who were killed were located by Israeli soldiers.Six people are currently missing, according to the Prime Minister’s Office. The office revised the number down from seven in light of Thursday’s confirmation of the death of Ofir Tzarfati, 27.A total of 110 people have been released from Hamas captivity so far, the statement said, comprising 86 Israelis and 24 foreigners.Of the Israelis, 80 were released under the terms of the agreement with Hamas, four were released earlier, one Russian-Israeli dual citizen was released due to Russian intervention, and one Israeli soldier was rescued by Israeli troops.This post has been updated to reflect new information on missing Israelis from the Prime Minister’s Office.Kept in the dark. Forced to sit in silence. Fed only meager rations. These and even more chilling scraps of information are beginning to show how hostages survived in Hamas captivity.Around 240 people, from infants to octogenarians, were taken hostage during Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7. Dozens have been freed but many more remain missing, presumed to be held by the Palestinian militant organization and other groups in Gaza, as the warring sides resume battle.The Red Cross and other humanitarian groups have not been allowed to visit the hostages. So relatives and the wider watching world have to wait for testimony from those who have been freed to know what might be happening to their loved ones still held in Gaza: whether they have been seen, if they are alive or dead.The details below have been compiled from comments by freed hostages to their families, their carers and sometimes to reporters.Under the terms of the deal between Israel and Hamas, most of those released are women, children and foreign workers. As of Friday, only one adult Israeli man - who also had Russian citizenship – had been released and no members of the Israeli military. Hostages are believed to be spread across locations and in the hands of different groups. It’s already seeming that not all hostages were treated the same way; the story of each new person recovered will add to the understanding.One hostage, Adina Moshe, was dragged from her safe room at home in Israel, taken to Gaza and forced into tunnels five stories underground, her nephew Eyal Nouri said.Moshe said his aunt was held in an underground room where the lights were switched on for only two hours a day. The darkness was literal and also figurative, Nouri said. Deprived of any information, their other senses and imaginations became keener.Read the full story here:Hamas said Israel “refused all offers” to extend the truce during negotiations, in a statement released Friday – a claim that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office dismissed as propaganda.The militant group also said it had offered to return the bodies of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas and release their father Yarden. All four were all kidnapped from Nir Oz, an Israeli kibbutz that was devastated when it came under attack by Hamas militants on October 7.Hamas said earlier this week that the boys and their mother had been killed but did not provide evidence. The Israel Defense Forces said it was assessing the claim.The Hamas statement accused the Israeli government of refusing the offers because a decision had already been made to resume the fighting.When asked for comment on the claims from Hamas, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said: “Israel will not address propaganda-based reports coming from Hamas.The Israeli military said in an earlier statement on Friday morning that it had resumed combat operations against Hamas after the group violated the terms of the existing agreement and fired towards Israel.No aid trucks crossed into Gaza on Friday after the truce expired and fighting resumed, an eyewitness at the Rafah crossing told CNN.Dozens of trucks that had undergone the Israeli inspection at the Nitzana crossing in Israel were seen waiting at the gate of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing.CNN reported earlier this week that hundreds of aid trucks were waiting for inspection near the Nitzana crossing. Under the truce agreement, up to 200 trucks were allowed to enter Gaza every day.A fuel truck that went through the Egyptian gate of the Rafah border crossing earlier Friday was also seen waiting and did not cross into Gaza, the eyewitness said.After the truce expired on Friday, the eyewitness heard several rounds of artillery shelling hitting Rafah in Gaza throughout the morning. The explosions were felt shaking the ground at the Egyptian side of the border, the eyewitness added.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed his deep regret at the resumption of fighting between Israel and Hamas.Separately, James Elder, a spokesperson for UNICEF, the UN’s Children’s Fund, decried what he called a “war on children” in a video message recorded inside one of Gaza’s last functioning hospitals.Elder also said that bombing in the area could be heard from inside the hospital and that one strike had landed approximately 50 meters away.The uncle of two teenage brothers released by Hamas on November 27 has testified that children were burned by members of the militant group while in captivity.Yaniv Yaakov, uncle of 16-year-old Or Yaakov and his brother Yagil Yaakov, 13, says the children were burned by having their legs held against the exhaust pipes of motorcycles.He made the claim at a meeting of OSCE foreign ministers in Skopje, North Macedonia. Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a video of the remarks.“The kids were released and they told us stories about what they’ve been through inside Gaza. Stories that are horrible,” Yaakov said.CNN has not independently verified Yaakov’s claims.The boys, their father Yair Yaakov, and Yair’s partner were abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. Nir Oz was devastated during Hamas’ attack; more than a quarter of the community was killed or taken hostage.The boys’ father remains in captivity in Gaza but his partner, Merav Tal, was released on November 28.Negotiations between Israel and Hamas are continuing despite the resumption of hostilities, according to a statement from the Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday.The ministry added that “the continued bombing of the Gaza Strip in the first hours after the end of the pause complicates mediation efforts and exacerbates the humanitarian catastrophe in the strip.”It called on the international community to “move quickly to stop the violence.”Qatar condemned any targeting or forced displacement of civilians in Gaza and called for an immediate ceasefire to ensure the unhindered flow of relief aid into the strip, according to the statement.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on Friday, calling it a “fighting zone” and telling residents to “evacuate immediately.”During fighting prior to the recent truce, Israel repeatedly told residents of northern Gaza to move south of Wadi Gaza for their safety. The city of Khan Younis is located south of that line. The United Nations estimates that at least 946,000 internally displaced Gazans are currently in southern Gaza.The leaflet drop came as Israel said on Friday it had resumed combat operations against Hamas after the seven-day truce.Sirens warning of incoming rockets sounded in communities surrounding the Gaza Strip and the city of Ashkelon Friday morning, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).The warnings came in the hours after a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas ended at 7 a.m. local time (12 a.m. ET). One siren sounded in the hour before the truce ended.The IDF said it had resumed combat operations against Hamas, claiming the group violated the truce and fired toward Israel.Thirty-two people have been killed and dozens injured by Israeli strikes in Gaza on Friday, according to a spokesperson for the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health.Earlier, the ministry said 14 people had been killed.Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra said the majority of those killed were women and children.A statement from the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Interior said that Israeli strikes had resumed across Gaza Friday morning after a temporary truce between the militant group and Israel ended.This post has been updated with additional details.The Hamas-controlled Government Media Office has blamed the United States and the international community for the resumption of fighting in Gaza after a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas broke down Friday.The ministry said that America and the international community “bears responsibility for the crimes of the ‘Israeli’ occupation and the continuation of the brutal war against civilians, children and women in the Gaza Strip.”The statement added that Palestinians had a right to defend themselves “by all means” and to establish a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.After a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas expired, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are once again “out to destroy” Hamas, according to a spokesperson.The Israeli military’s aim is to destroy the militant group “so they can never commit this crime in Israel again, and along the way, bring our people home,” IDF spokesperson Maj. Doron Spielman told CNN Friday, as Israeli forces resumed combat missions against Hamas in Gaza.Spielman said the military’s targets remain “Hamas strongholds, Hamas terrorists and where they shot the rocket launchers.”Sirens went off in Israel in the hour before the truce was due to expire Friday morning, warning of an incoming rocket which was intercepted. Sirens have continued in Israeli communities around Gaza since.A potential resumption of the truce is up to politicians, not the military, Spielman said.Asked about the IDF targeting civilian areas in Gaza, Spielman said: “We don’t want to see Gaza civilians die, but Hamas is operating directly from within those areas, and we have to ask ourselves what is the alternative?”Spielman also argued that Hamas was not targeting troops, “they were targeting directly toward civilians.”The Israeli military resumed fighting against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group broke the outline of the truce, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement released from his office Friday.Hamas “didn’t respect its obligation to release today all the abducted women and launched rockets toward the citizens of Israel,” Netanyahu said.With the return of the combat mission, the “government of Israel is obliged to accomplish the targets of the fighting,” according to the prime minister.He said those targets are “to release the hostages, to liquidate Hamas” and to ensure the citizens of Israel are never again threatened by an attack from Gaza.Negotiations with Qatari and Egyptian mediators over the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are still ongoing, a source familiar with the talks told CNN, even after Israel’s military announced the resumption of combat operations in Gaza early Friday.An hour past the 7 a.m. local time expiration of the truce, none of the main parties involved – Hamas, Qatar, Israel, the US or Egypt – had publicly declared a breakdown in the talks.Negotiations had been aimed at extending the seven-day pause in the war.Under the terms of a previously struck agreement, Hamas had been expected to propose an eighth list of hostages — 10 women and children to be released on Friday in exchange for an extra day of pause.Israel has demanded that Hamas release women and children, alive, before moving on to other groups of hostages.Israel had warned that full-scale military operations would resume once the current phase of hostage releases ends. But US officials have said talks will continue regardless to free the remaining hostages.This post has been updated with additional information.Hours before Israel said it had resumed combat operations against Hamas, the United States pressured its ally to shield Palestinian civilians in one of the most significant diplomatic moves yet in the more than 50-day conflict.The question now, if a seven-day truce is permanently broken, is whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is prepared to listen.Secretary of State Antony Blinken laid out American requirements both at a televised press conference in Tel Aviv and in private talks in Jerusalem with Netanyahu and his war cabinet.Blinken’s frank tone suggests that the White House is not completely buying Israel’s assurances that it takes every possible step to alleviate civilian casualties in its response to the October 7 Hamas terror attack that killed 1,200 people.Blinken noted bluntly, for instance, that he told Netanyahu: “Intent matters. But so does the result.”Blinken said that Netanyahu had agreed to take steps to protect civilians. But two key questions now will be whether those efforts are genuine and effective and to what extent the Israeli prime minister and his military brass are willing to accommodate US concerns.Read more about the US approach here.Israeli strikes have resumed in areas across Gaza, according to a statement from the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Interior.It follows the break down of a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas on Friday.An earlier statement from the ministry said that strikes had landed in southern Gaza, in the areas of Khan Younis and Rafah.The ministry also noted earlier that Israeli military vehicles were firing in northwest Gaza minutes after the truce expired.Minutes after a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas broke down on Friday, Israeli military vehicles were firing in northwest Gaza, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Interior in Gaza.In a statement, the ministry also said Israeli aircraft were in the skies above the area.The statement from Hamas comes as the Israeli military said it had resumed combat operations against the militant group, accusing it of violating the truce agreement by firing toward Israel.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it has resumed combat operations against Hamas, accusing the militant group of violating the truce agreement by firing toward Israel.The truce between Israel and Hamas appeared to have expired Friday with no immediate sign of an agreement being reached to further extend the hostage deal to an eighth day.It is not yet clear whether this means that fighting will resume in the Gaza Strip, which suffered extensive damage and loss of life during seven weeks of Israeli bombardment.An hour before Friday’s deadline was set to expire Israel’s aerial defense system intercepted one rocket launched from the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military said. There was no indication of who launched the single rocket.The truce, which started last Friday, was expected to expire at 7 a.m. local time (12 a.m. ET). An agreement to extend to a seventh day came down to the wire on Thursday.Some context: Egyptian and Qatari negotiators had been pushing to extend the pause in fighting in Gaza for an extra two days to facilitate the release of further hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and to allow more aid into the strip, according to Egypt’s State Information Service.Israeli officials have repeatedly stated that a condition of any extension to the pause in fighting is that Hamas must release 10 Israeli women and children held hostage per day.Under the terms of the deal, Israel freed three Palestinians for every Israeli hostage released.As the truce expiration loomed both Israel and Hamas have indicated they’re prepared for fighting to resume.Hamas’ military wing on Thursday asked its forces to maintain a high-combat readiness posture.In the seven-day pause in fighting, 80 Israelis — primarily women and children and some of whom are dual citizens — and another 24 foreign nationals have been released. Another Israeli dual citizen was also freed outside of the agreed-upon deal.As of Thursday, 240 Palestinians had been freed from Israeli prisons — mainly women and minors.An uneasy truce between Israel and Hamas that has lasted for seven days is set to expire again at around 7 a.m. local time Friday (midnight ET).Just over an hour before the truce was set to expire, the Israeli military said its air defense system intercepted one rocket launched from Gaza.The pause in fighting has brought temporary respite to those in the besieged enclave of Gaza and led to the release of dozens of hostages, the freeing of Palestinians from Israeli jails and the ratcheting up of much-needed humanitarian supplies to the strip.The truce, which started last Friday, was only renewed at the last minute for the seventh day on Thursday after a tense and lengthy back-and-forth.Both sides are in a day-to-day extension phase of the agreement under which Hamas must offer up a new list of 10 hostages to be released to secure another 24 hours in the pause in fighting.The military wing of Hamas is calling for its forces to remain on “high combat readiness” in case combat resumes, a statement said.Here’s what you should know to get up to speed:The Israeli military’s air defense system intercepted one rocket launched from the Gaza Strip just over an hour before the truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said early Friday local time.There is no indication of who launched the single rocket.Rocket sirens have been heard in the Sderot area in the final hours of the seven-day truce.The current agreement between Israel and Hamas is set to expire at 7 a.m. local time Friday (midnight ET).This post has been updated with additional information.Israeli officials obtained a document describing Hamas’ battle plan for its October 7 terror attack more than a year before the militant group carried out the assault, the New York Times reported Thursday, citing documents, emails and interviews.The roughly 40-page document did not give a date for the attack, but outlined “point by point” the kind of deadly incursion that Hamas carried out in Israeli territory in October, according to the Times, which reviewed the translated document.Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan, assessing that it would be too difficult for Hamas to carry out, according to the Times.The document, which the Israeli authorities code-named “Jericho Wall,” detailed an assault that would overwhelm fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and target key military bases. It was followed with precision by Hamas on October 7, the Times said.On that day, Hamas militants struck across the border from Gaza in a coordinated assault taking more than 200 hostages and killing around 1,200 people – the largest such attack on Israel since the country’s founding in 1948.The attack was widely seen a major Israeli intelligence failure, with a number of top defense and security officials coming forward in October to take responsibility to some extent for missteps that led to the attacks.Later that month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received sharp public criticism after he accused security chiefs in a later-deleted social media post of failing to warn him about the impending attack.“On the contrary, all the defense officials … assessed that Hamas was deterred,” Netanyahu wrote at the time.According to the Times, the “Jericho Wall” document was circulated widely among Israeli military and intelligence leaders, but it was unclear whether Netanyahu or other top political leaders saw the document.A total of 30 Palestinians were released from Israeli prisons in Damon, Megiddo, Ofer, Nafha, Ktzi’ot and Ramon on Thursday, the Israeli prison service said in a statement.Under the terms of the Israel-Hamas truce, Israel has to free three Palestinians for every Israeli hostage freed.After a tense and lengthy back-and-forth on extending the truce into a seventh day, the Israeli government eventually accepted a proposal for Hamas to release eight new Israeli hostages on Thursday. Israel agreed to count two Israeli-Russian hostages who were set free on Wednesday as part of Thursday’s release, multiple sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari also reiterated the terms of the truce extension Thursday, stating Israel would release 30 Palestinians in Israeli prisons in exchange for the release of 10 hostages in Gaza — with the two Israeli-Russian nationals released on Wednesday counted on the list as part of the hostage deal.CNN’s MJ Lee, Alex Marquardt, Kaitlan Collins and Becky Anderson contributed reporting to this post.A total of 2,781 trucks carrying thousands of tons of international aid have crossed from Egypt into Gaza since October 21 through the Rafah crossing, according to an Egyptian official.The aid comprises a substantial quantity of medical supplies and medications, amounting to 3,176 tons, according to Ayman Walash, director of Egypt’s foreign press center.Additionally, the aid includes 13,348 tons of food; 10,359 tons of water; 3,203 tons of other relief materials; and 137 tons of tents, Walash said during a press briefing in Al-Arish, Egypt, on Thursday.On the ground: A CNN team driving on a highway toward the Rafah crossing has observed hundreds of trucks loaded with aid awaiting entry into Gaza. One truck driver told CNN he has been waiting for 10 days to enter Gaza.Hamas and Israel are now fully in a day-to-day extension phase of their truce, where Hamas must offer up a new list of 10 hostages in order to secure another 24 hours in the pause in fighting.Hamas claimed until the last minute Thursday that it was having trouble locating enough hostages to fulfill Israel’s terms, posing serious challenges for the talks on extending the truce into a seventh day. After a tense and lengthy back-and-forth, Hamas ultimately waited until very close to the truce expiring to hand over a list.The Israeli government decided to accept the proposal from Hamas, which was to release only eight new Israeli hostages on Thursday, and count two Israeli-Russian hostages who were set free on Wednesday as part of Thursday’s release, multiple sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.When the time came, hostages were released Thursday from different places and at different times. According to an Israeli official, this is because the hostages were held in different locations in Gaza.With Thursday’s challenges in mind, anxious negotiators fear the process of extending the truce into an eighth day could be very challenging.Tamar Michaelis contributed reporting to this

Reuters,US says it's ready to 'pause' sanctions relief for Venezuela unless further progress seen,2023-12-01 21:04:00,"Matt Spetalnick, Steve Holland","WASHINGTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it was prepared to ""pause"" sanctions relief for OPEC member Venezuela in coming days unless there is further progress on the release of Venezuelan political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans.Speaking after a deadline for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to meet certain commitments, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. welcomed an announcement on Thursday that opposition presidential candidates barred from public office would be able to appeal to Venezuela’s highest court.But he said the Venezuelan government needed to do more or else Venezuela would risk a U.S. freeze on some relaxed sanctions unveiled in mid-October in response to a deal between Maduro and the country’s opposition on holding a 2024 presidential election.Any “snapback” of partially lifted U.S. sanctions would mark a major shift from President Joe Biden's new approach toward Venezuela.In the most significant lifting of tough Trump-era sanctions, Washington issued a six-month general license authorizing U.S. transactions with Venezuela’s vital oil and gas sector and a second license authorizing operations of state gold mining company Minerven. It also removed a U.S. prohibition on secondary-market trading of Venezuelan sovereign bonds.Washington had vowed to reverse that sanctions relief unless the Venezuela's Socialist government took steps by the end of November to release political prisoners and three Americans it considers unlawfully jailed, and also lift public-office bans on opposition candidates.Thursday’s announcement by the Venezuelan government and opposition, which opened a path that could enable opposition politicians to run, appeared to satisfy one of Washington’s chief demands.“It's welcome news,” Kirby said. “We are, however, deeply concerned about the lack of progress on the release of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens and Venezuelan political prisoners.”“So we're going to continue to be actively engaged here in diplomatic efforts on those particular issues, and we're prepared to take action in the coming days to pause certain sanctions relief, unless further progress is made,” he added.Kirby did not specify which of the sanctions-easing measures could be put on hold if Maduro fails to comply.Reflecting skepticism in some quarters about the likely extent of any new U.S. action, two sources in Washington said earlier this week that the administration may respond initially by just reinstating sanctions on state-run Minerven.The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.If the U.S. deems Maduro's actions insufficient, it faces a decision on whether to reignite tensions with Venezuela when Washington is grappling with major foreign policy crises, principally the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza and Russia's war in Ukraine.Under the appeals process announced late on Thursday, candidates can file petitions to the court between Dec. 1 and Dec. 15.The winner of the opposition's presidential primary, Maria Corina Machado, is among those barred from office.",3118,https://www.reuters.com/world/us-says-its-ready-pause-sanctions-relief-venezuela-unless-further-progress-seen-2023-12-01/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/P5ZL22BZUNPZ3JUK2YAFSRDBEI.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,gold shift enable make file quarter company prepared thursday court deadline president government joe oil reuters initially country dec day biden vital concerned gas gaza significant citizen administration approach measure spokesperson vowed progress sector bar transaction ban announce politician wrongfully news winner sovereign action extent satisfy petition machado pause white deeply prohibition skepticism unlawfully principally chief response reverse source put tension lift commitment nicolas engage actively conflict sanction opposition risk political mark tough open primary john minerven process effort issue security venezuela member late socialist announcement week reignite respond general relief detain lack insufficient office corina particular request kirby hold public maduro national release immediately meet welcome mining run high maria prisoner crisis state foreign authorize candidate operation policy unveiled license major washington november deems russia american house freeze earlier jail continue fails presidential specify reinstate appeal trading opec considers grapple remove diplomatic friday partially deal relaxed path venezuelan decision snapback step,0.7884,0.0,14.64390625,0.400285594035594,0,2023-12-01
CNN,Latest outbreak of deadly bird flu kills 220 flamingos in Argentina. The virus’ global spread concerns experts,2023-12-01 20:36:00,Taylor Nicioli,"Some 220 flamingos have been found dead in the province of Catamarca in northwestern Argentina due to an outbreak of avian influenza, otherwise known as bird flu, an official told local media.Bird flu is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease that naturally spreads through wild aquatic birds, such as ducks, geese and swans, but can also infect other bird species, such as domestic poultry, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has spread in more than 80 countries since 2022, according to the World Health Organization, and experts have concerns amid its ongoing impact across continents. H5N1 is the predominant version causing problems in the Americas and Europe, and there are several subtypes of the virus reported as the disease continuously mutates, according to WHO.Around the globe, there have been reports of bird flu outbreaks flaring in various mammals such as seals and farmed mink, detection of H5N1 viruses in domestic cats and dogs, as well as a few cases reported in humans.Currently, there is no effective treatment for the virus, according to the New York State Wildlife Health Program.The infected species — known as James’ flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamesi), or the puna flamingo — is one of three types of flamingos found in northwestern Argentina. The birds pose a risk of spreading the disease to new areas during migration.Originally, the H5N1 strain spread from North America to South America through migratory birds in a span of three months, according to Dr. Johanna Harvey, a postdoctoral researcher of environmental science and technology at the University of Maryland who has studied the strain.It only takes one infected bird to pass on the virus to a whole flock in a matter of days, Harvey said, adding that flamingos are known to be highly gregarious, social animals that live in large flocks.The H5N1 strain poses a low risk to humans — since December 2021, 11 cases of the strain have been reported in humans globally, according to the CDC. But experts are closely monitoring the lethal pathogen’s spread to other mammals, such as when more than 50 sea lions were found dead in August in Argentina due to infection of the virus.“My concerns are that it’s in a lot of birds, birds are clearly continuing to move it, and it’s not going away … and as these mortalities pile up, the impact on populations, and potentially even (entire) species, is really great,” Harvey said. “The true magnitude of loss here, I do not believe is well understood and has not been documented, because it’s a really hard thing to do.”In this latest outbreak, the provincial director of biodiversity for Catamarca, Anabella Ahumada, confirmed the cause of death of hundreds of flamingos to local media, following positive test results for H5N1 in 3 out of 6 samples taken from the dead birds by SENASA, Argentina’s National Food Safety and Quality Service.Park rangers detected the high rates of mortality in the birds near the bodies of water Laguna Grande and Laguna Diamante, Ahumada told local media outlet Catamarca 12. The province has been under epidemiological surveillance since the start of November, Catamarca 12 reported.The Argentine government has recommended that people do not come into contact with sick or deceased birds without adequate protection.Across the United States, zoos have been moving their captive birds indoors as the rate of infection continues to rise. In 2022, the Pittsburgh Zoo, the Denver Zoo, the Maryland Zoo and other facilities moved their bird species indoors away from people and other wildlife. Last month, the Dallas Zoo moved its flamingos indoors, NBC 5 in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area reported.The virus has spread through saliva, mucus and feces from infected birds, according to the CDC. In mammals, some scavenging species have come in contact with the virus by eating infected bird carcasses, Harvey said.“As far as people interacting with wild birds, there doesn’t seem to be a huge risk to them, because the number of human cases have remained low globally, so we’re not too worried about that,” said Dr. Krysten Schuler, an assistant research professor in the department of public and ecosystem health at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York. “But the mutation potential and the wide distribution of this virus are the major risk factors.”James’ flamingo is listed as “near threatened” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, Schuler noted. The main threats to the bird include habitat loss caused by mining, as well as human disturbances due to recreational activities, according to IUCN. When the virus affects birds that are already struggling population-wise, it can have the potential to eliminate species, Schuler said.There is not much that can be done to stop the spread of the virus, but Schuler recommends that people report any unusual animal deaths without an obvious cause to their state wildlife agencies, so they can be notified of what areas the disease is spreading.“If there is any potential to do something about it, our best option is right at the beginning,” Schuler said.",5215,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/world/bird-flu-flamingos-dead-argentina-scn/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150103074330-hubble-space-background-2-full-169.jpg?q=h_900,w_1600,x_0,y_0/w_1280",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,confirm national concern control water effective center large medium schuler social flare quality body south number population unusual adequate mink august public research director note ongoing live continuously nbc human potential flu ecosystem bird johanna wild impact domestic dallas organization migratory obvious diamante official swan krysten detect closely contact provincial postdoctoral saliva high zoo positive mining technology feces geese version rise maryland interact country phoenicoparrus veterinary treatment wide outlet indoors mortality harvey mutates magnitude threaten potentially cornell entire rate james york deadly amid detection day nature safety laguna government start jamesi remain begin biodiversity assistant contagious disease seal farm problem gregarious mammal sick test late world lot surveillance recommend agency infect understood ahumada found accord expert struggle scavenge ithaca death iucn spread stop span college grande local province argentina state distribution wildlife aquatic avian continent worried anabella carcass duck red hard department health epidemiological viral catamarca away highly lion predominant facility disturbance affect naturally poultry ranger result believe hundred northwestern globally continue worth recreational activity option major outbreak move study union north area add international cdc captive environmental mutation case report monitoring america metro subtypes document low specie huge strain eat influenza risk matter great senasa pile denver researcher europe notify month list science lethal puna pittsburgh globe type threat virus argentine medicine november infection december follow recommends loss united habitat decease sample university eliminate flamingo include told food flock professor pose due mucus pathogen dead conservation animal,-0.95865,0.3451581975071908,10.393009307135468,0.4328124828757739,0,2023-12-01
ABC,Venezuela's government and opposition agree on appeal process for candidates banned from running,2023-12-01 18:01:00,REGINA GARCIA CANO Associated Press,"MEXICO CITY -- Venezuela’s government and a faction of the opposition have agreed on a process through which aspiring presidential candidates who were banned from running for office can attempt to get that decision reversed. The timeline to file an appeal opened Friday.The agreement, released late Thursday by negotiators from each side and the Norwegian diplomats guiding the dialogue, gives the candidates until Dec. 15 to challenge their ban — a tool the Venezuelan government has repeatedly used to sideline adversaries, including most recently against opposition leader and presidential candidate María Corina Machado.The deal is part of a broader agreement signed in October between a U.S.-backed opposition group and the government of Nicolás Maduro focused on electoral conditions ahead of the 2024 presidential election. It is also expected to keep the U.S. government from re-imposing some economic sanctions on Maduro’s administration.The October agreement triggered some sanctions relief in the oil, gas, and mining sectors. But the U.S. government, aware that Maduro has breached agreements before, threatened to reverse some of the relief if Venezuela's government failed to establish by the end of November a timeline and process to quickly reinstate all candidates.The agreement announced Thursday instructs interested candidates to file an appeal in person before the electoral chamber of Venezuela’s top court, which is stacked with judges who are loyal to the government and just over a month ago suspended the opposition’s primary election process.The steps outlined in the agreement also force interested appellants into a quasi-gag order, banning them from incorporating “offensive or disrespectful concepts against the institutions of the State” in their appeal and public statements.The document leaves open to interpretation what constitutes offensive or disrespectful comments. It also lacks a timeline for the judges to rule on the request, stating only that they would do so “in accordance with the principles of speed, efficiency and effectiveness included in the Constitution.”“It’s just really puzzling, it’s really thin, and it’s really quite comical in many senses,” said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “We’ve been demanding this process, but this is essentially tantamount to Maduro telling us when in the future he decides to make an executive decision on candidate bans.”Despite the process's lack of clarity, Berg said, it seems likely “that's going to be sufficient” for the Biden administration to hold off on snapback sanctions review.Machado, a former lawmaker and longtime government foe, won the opposition’s presidential primary with more than 90% of support. The government announced a 15-year ban against Machado days after she had formally entered the race, but she was able to participate in the election because the effort was organized by a commission that received no help from Venezuela’s electoral authorities.Machado’s campaign on Friday declined to comment on the appeal process. Her ban alleges fraud and tax violations and accuses her of seeking the economic sanctions the U.S. imposed on Venezuela.“On Oct. 22, people took care of the irrational attempt to block me,” she told supporters Thursday before the agreement was announced. “The only thing that matters to me is what people think. The only thing I am dedicated to ... is to build this citizen force that is going to defeat Nicolás Maduro or whoever they feel like putting against me.”A United Nations-backed panel investigating human rights abuses in Venezuela earlier this year said Maduro’s government has intensified efforts to curtail democratic freedoms ahead of the 2024 election. That includes subjecting some politicians, human rights defenders and other opponents to detention, surveillance, threats, defamatory campaigns and arbitrary criminal proceedings.Negotiations between Maduro’s government and the U.S.-backed opposition Unitary Platform, began in 2021 in Mexico City with the mediation of Norwegian diplomats. But the dialogue stalled at various points.From the start, Maduro demanded that the U.S. drop economic sanctions and unfreeze Venezuelan funds held overseas. The opposition sought guarantees for the election to avoid conditions in previous votes that were widely considered to favor pro-government candidates.____",4444,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/venezuelas-government-opposition-agree-appeal-process-candidates-banned-105321529,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2f3f7cf7-dec1-4172-9783-a6466c31cdba/wirestory_d079225e2fa0d171e751f0a9bd5570ad_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,suspend make file widely thursday begin constitutes matter challenge document agreement alleges fraud expect build biden told gas judge administration norwegian comment decline criminal timeline sideline ahead ban announce order offensive sens overseas maría consider panel machado effectiveness human speed stack diplomat put unfreeze sought mexico group sanction aspire open essentially process efficiency former mediation irrational give relief surveillance decides office chamber corina director request adversary hold public maduro sign electoral outline sufficient dialogue economic tax run center accordance city attempt future support democratic earlier participate quickly fail presidential focus reinstate formally condition appeal freedom comical defamatory feel accuses october deal receive venezuelan defeat organize snapback november executive supporter establish puzzle america concept court government race fund oil seek berg instructs day study include citizen curtail arbitrary disrespectful breach guide international foe platform ago favor rule commission vote sector subject violation repeatedly politician leaf previous tantamount abuse investigate dedicate unitary faction interested recently negotiator force reverse incorporate clarity side opposition guarantee enter threaten block primary thin effort avoid venezuela late year opponent strategic top tool lack intensified election longtime drop institution release broader threat campaign lawmaker appellant detention mining principle agree program person aware state impose leader candidate part nicolás loyal interpretation ryan despite defender held month friday united start trigger demand stall decision step,-0.87785,0.135013501350135,13.353493333333333,0.422037037037037,0,2023-12-01
ABC,Global Red Cross suspends Belarus chapter after its chief boasted of bringing in Ukrainian children,2023-12-01 16:38:00,YURAS KARMANAU Associated Press,"TALLINN, Estonia -- The International Red Cross on Friday suspended the Belarusian chapter after its chief stirred international outrage for boasting that it was actively ferrying Ukrainian children from Russian-controlled areas to Belarus.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies halted the membership of the Belarus branch after it refused to oust its leader Dzmitry Shautsou. He is accused of having breached the Red Cross' much-vaunted and much-defended standards of neutrality and integrity. The board of IFRC had given the Belarus Red Cross until Nov. 30 to dismiss him, and said it would suspend the branch if it didn't.“The suspension means that the Belarus Red Cross loses its rights as a member of the IFRC,” the Geneva-based international organization said in a statement Friday. ""Any new funding to the Belarus Red Cross will also be suspended.”Shautsou, in comments to the state Belta news agency, called the decision to suspend the Belarus Red Cross from the IFRC “absolutely politicized.” He said he went to the occupied areas in eastern Ukraine “to prove that children that undergo health improvement in Belarus return home safely.”Last year, the Belarus Red Cross received nearly 1.7 million Swiss francs ($1.9 million) from the the IFRC for services like HIV prevention, support for migrants near the border with Poland, “clown therapy” and help for people fleeing neighboring Ukraine. This year, the outlay has been more than 1 million francs.Shautsou was seen publicly wearing military fatigues with the “Z” insignia of Russian forces, and he claimed publicly that he favored deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus.He also told Belarusian television that the Belarus Red Cross was actively involved in bringing Ukrainian children to Belarus for “health improvement” purposes.Belarus has been Moscow’s closest ally since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, when its authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko allowed the Kremlin to send troops and weapons into Ukraine from Belarus. Russia has also deployed tactical nuclear weapons there.More than 2,400 Ukrainian children aged 6-17 have been brought to Belarus from four Ukrainian regions that have been partially occupied by Russian forces, according to a recent study by Yale University. The Belarusian opposition is seeking an international probe into the effort and says Lukashenko and his officials should be held accountable for it.The Belarus Red Cross has maintained that it did not take part in the removal of the children from Ukraine, and that the transfers were arranged by a Belarusian charity founded by state-backed Paralympic athlete Alexei Talai. Shautsou, however, in a report aired by the state TV channel Belarus 1 was seen visiting the occupied Ukrainian region of Luhansk and said that his organization took “an active part” in the transfers.An internal IFRC probe found that the Belarus Red Cross said Shautsou was “found to be solely responsible for the allegations.” It also determined that another organization was responsible for moving children from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, and the Belarus Red Cross’ involvement was only within Belarus. It did not specify the other organization.The IFRC spells the name of the secretary-general of Belarus Red Cross as Dmitry Shevtsov.",3332,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/global-red-cross-suspends-belarus-chapter-after-chief-105319428,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/05df59f2-c561-497d-926b-c600944c8da5/wirestory_fecce3dd920565e5299737de4a9a86f3_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,suspend tv tallinn board accuse migrant president outrage lukashenko arrange invasion begin athlete seek closest home agency study belarusian told dismiss official february belta poland franc troop claimed red chapter comment recent ukraine clown breach active international refuse area russian favor integrity found involvement therapy authoritarian child news statement outlay wear television hiv ifrc swiss ukrainian force internal neutrality prove chief deployment responsible health accord visit insignia actively dzmitry suspension loses charity report opposition age maintain air weapon spell talai brought flee effort stir society call member membership ally region crescent ferry year nuclear military absolutely give organization moscow paralympic funding determine estonia channel branch send standard yale alexei removal service probe state prevention accountable leader part shautsou return cross transfer boasting involve university tactical border luhansk support russia neighbor shevtsov publicly fatigue specify held deployed dmitry oust partially halt belarus occupy eastern solely friday federation undergo improvement million receive alexander bring decision move kremlin,0.64515,0.0900360144057623,12.974603174603176,0.1703369905956113,0,2023-12-01
ABC,Why Hamas could emerge stronger militarily from the temporary cease-fire with Israel,2023-12-01 16:33:00,Luis Martinez and Nate Luna,"While much attention has been paid to the humanitarian relief enabled by the weeklong truce between Hamas and Israel, national security experts note that the pause may have given Hamas the opportunity to strengthen and resupply its forces for when hostilities resumed Friday.The truce has led to the successful release of dozens of Israeli and other foreign hostages and hundreds of Palestinian detainees held in Israeli prisons. But both Israeli and U.S. officials had previously advocated for ""pauses"" in the fighting instead of a general cease-fire, suggesting publicly in the weeks before the truce that a general cease-fire would benefit Hamas.However, as those short-term pauses were extended daily over the past week, they amounted to at least a temporary cease-fire.The concern was that Hamas would emerge strengthened so its forces could respond to Israel's devastating ground and aerial assault in northern Gaza, and potentially in southern Gaza, where many of the enclave's 2 million civilian residents are now located after heeding Israel's warnings to leave northern Gaza before Israeli forces attacked there.Those questions of whether Hamas has benefited from the temporary truce may be answered soon as Israel resumed its offensive operations on Friday by launching airstrikes in the Gaza Strip after it said Hamas had violated the terms of the cease-fire.Earlier this week, a U.S. top national security spokesman acknowledged ""a real risk"" that Hamas may have benefited from the daily truce extensions to enable the continued transfer of Israeli and other foreign hostages and Palestinian detainees held in Israeli prisons.""We are watching that closely and our Israeli counterparts, you can bet [they] are watching that closely,"" John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman told White House reporters on Monday.""I would just say that without getting into intelligence issues that any pause in the fighting could benefit your enemy in terms of time to refit, to rest your fighters, to rearm them, re-equip them,"" said Kirby. ""A pause in the fighting can be seen as a benefit but again, I want to stress this was always part of the calculus.""That calculus weighed against the benefits Israel and the U.S. would gain from the return of hostages held by Hamas, according to Kirby.Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and ABC News contributor, described the pause in fighting as a ""net win"" for Hamas ""both militarily and politically.""""I believe Israel knew this would be the case, but it was worth it for them to recover their hostages,"" he added.Mulroy and other national security analysts who spoke with ABC News concur that Hamas has likely used the temporary truce to refit, re-arm, and reposition its forces in Gaza.""This has stopped the IDF's momentum, allowing Hamas to maneuver to gain a tactical advantage,"" according to Mulroy.There have been 15,000 people killed in Gaza and 36,000 injured, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. In Israel, at least 1,200 people have been killed and 6,900 have been injured, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.While the scale of the destruction to buildings in northern Gaza caused by Israel's airstrikes and ground offensive is very visible, what is uncertain is how much of Hamas' military infrastructure has been destroyed.""One of the disadvantages that we have is we actually don't know how much of the military apparatus of Hamas has been destroyed or dismantled,"" said retired U.S. Army Gen. Robert Abrams, former commander of U.S. Forces Korea and an ABC News contributor.""We don't know how many command posts have been destroyed. We don't know how much of their arms, ammunition, or explosives have been captured or destroyed. The longer there's a cease-fire, it's going to give Hamas an opportunity to rearm, rethink, and reestablish,"" Abrams said.But the pause also likely brings risks for Hamas, according to Eric Oehlerich, a retired U.S. Navy SEAL and ABC News contributor, who believes the hostages returned to Israel could have provided intelligence useful to Israel's military.""When debriefed by IDF planners, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will now have increased information on 'how' they were being held. Potentially, 'where' can be figured out if the IDF planners are deliberate and smart, and the hostages most importantly will be able to talk about Hamas' status, motivation, fears etc."" said Oehlerich.But Israeli intelligence gains may have been offset by Israel's agreement to stop flying reconnaissance drones above Gaza at specific times during the truce, Oehlerich added.""They're going to make their own assessment of where the Israelis are going to strike next. They're going to position their forces to try and not be where they don't want to be and to try and put themselves in a position where they can attack or slow down the Israelis. So, I am sure there is some very furious activity going on,"" he said.""Israeli use of overhead surveillance, which they're very good at, is going to be diminished during this time,"" retired Army Lt. Gen. William Troy told ABC News, speaking while the cease-fire was still in effect. ""I would guess that it might frustrate some IDF commanders on the ground, but that's what they're going to have to contend with.""""I'm sure a lot of their weapons are in storage areas that maybe have not been accessible, but now that the Israelis can't fly surveillance all the time, they can get to those places and then they can reposition their forces,"" Troy added.Regardless of the success of continued diplomatic efforts to continue the daily truces that have enabled the hostage and detainee exchanges, he said both sides have learned from the previous weeks of fighting in northern Gaza.",5777,https://abcnews.go.com/International/hamas-emerge-stronger-militarily-temporary-cease-fire-israel/story?id=105280584,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/55c7074a-c3f6-47b9-93b4-703c9d83dad8/israel-gaza-8-rt-231130_1701357947493_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,ground make middle palestinian increase potentially extend seal knew kill agreement dozen command troy contend diminish past told northern official secretary abrams minister fly infrastructure ministry figure emerge ammunition apparatus capture closely enemy slow news offensive destruction daily pause rest debriefed abc continued spoke prison motivation strengthen put importantly explosive launch injured council politically concur civilian expert weapon spokesman scale advocate southern resume exchange former military lot week strip give surveillance relief deliberate smart add assessment successful stop monday enclave retire place defense foreign operation disadvantage frustrate believe assault described provide tactical house idf resupply leave publicly continue commander navy longer temporary israel airstrikes note reconnaissance overhead diplomatic stress million reestablish win drone learn enable violate analyst locate rethink instead humanitarian devastate building guess prime dismantle strike storage detainee resident hostage gaza activity maneuver robert term israeli army brings destroyed acknowledge attack reposition lead area concern reporter previous time heed amount previously extension rearm fighter opportunity status uncertain mulroy advantage white force weigh truce health fight attention accord paid calculus furious side information risk deputy east john counterpart militarily hostility issue effort security question accessible fear respond top success general real effect hundred kirby national william release benefit speak case bet worth korea warning recover intelligence visible position arm suggest contributor part return momentum answer eric transfer watch hamas post offset net specific refit held aerial assistant planner oehlerich friday talk weeklong,-0.9844,0.2596503375454388,10.17345690454124,0.3373363095238094,0,2023-12-01
CNN,What did Israel know about Hamas’ October 7 attack?,2023-12-01 16:14:00,Rob Picheta,"Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7 left Israel flat-footed, sparking a backlash that is still rippling through the country.The operation saw at least 1,500 Hamas fighters pour across the border into Israel, in an assault that killed at least 1,200 Israelis, while others are still held hostage by the militant group.But a report from the New York Times claimed Israel obtained Hamas’ plan for the attack more than a year in advance.The report says Israeli officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, and deemed it too complex for the group to carry out. Other outlets, including Israeli newspaper Haaretz, have also reported the claim.Here’s what we know about Israel and the US’ advance knowledge of the attack.Israeli officials obtained a document describing Hamas’ battle plan for its October 7 terror attack more than a year before the militant group carried out the assault, the New York Times reported Thursday, citing documents, emails and interviews.The roughly 40-page document did not give a date for the attack, but outlined “point by point” the kind of deadly incursion that Hamas carried out in Israeli territory in October, according to the Times, which reviewed the translated document.Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan, assessing that it would be too difficult for Hamas to carry out, according to the Times.The document, which the Israeli authorities code-named “Jericho Wall,” detailed an assault that would overwhelm fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and target key military bases. It was followed with precision by Hamas on October 7, the Times said.On that day, Hamas militants struck across the border from Gaza in a coordinated assault in what was the deadliest single-day assault on Israel since the country’s founding in 1948.The attack was widely seen as a major Israeli intelligence failure, with a number of top defense and security officials coming forward in October to take responsibility to some extent for missteps that led to the attacks.Later that month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received sharp public criticism after he accused security chiefs in a later-deleted social media post of failing to warn him about the impending attack.“On the contrary, all the defense officials … assessed that Hamas was deterred,” Netanyahu wrote at the time.In a CNN interview earlier this month Netanyahu refused to answer whether he would take responsibility for failing to prevent the attack.According to the Times, the “Jericho Wall” document was circulated widely among Israeli military and intelligence leaders, but it was unclear whether Netanyahu or other top political leaders saw the document.The US intelligence community produced at least two assessments, based in part on intelligence provided by Israel, warning the Biden administration of an increased risk for Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the weeks ahead of the seismic attack on southern Israel, sources familiar with the intelligence said in the days after October 7.One update from September 28 warned, based on multiple streams of intelligence, that the terror group Hamas was poised to escalate rocket attacks across the border.An October 5 wire from the CIA warned generally of the increasing possibility of violence by Hamas.Then, on October 6, the day before the attack, US officials circulated reporting from Israel indicating unusual activity by Hamas — indications that are now clear: an attack was imminent.None of the American assessments offered any tactical details or indications of the overwhelming scope, scale and sheer brutality of the operation that Hamas carried out on October 7, sources say. It is unclear if any of these US assessments were shared with Israel, which provides much of the intelligence that the US bases its reports on.A US official told CNN Friday that the US government had no prior knowledge of the “Jericho Wall” document that the New York Times reported on that purportedly detailed Hamas’ battle plan of the October 7 attack.“There are no indicators at this time that the intelligence community was provided the purported ‘Jericho Wall’ document reported last night by the New York Times,” the official said. “The intelligence community will certainly continue to review its information.”Intelligence shared with the US suggested a small cell of Hamas operatives planned the deadly surprise attack via a network of hardwired phones built into the network of tunnels underneath Gaza over a period of two years, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN in late October.The phone lines in the tunnels allowed the operatives to communicate with one another in secret and meant they could not be tracked by Israeli intelligence officials, the sources told CNN.During the two years of planning, the small cell operating in the tunnels used the hardwired phone lines to communicate and plan the operation but stayed dark until it was time to activate and call on hundreds of Hamas fighters to launch the October 7 attack, the sources said.They avoided using computers or cell phones during the two-year period to evade detection by Israeli or US intelligence, the sources said.The intelligence shared with US officials by Israel reveals how Hamas hid the planning of the operation through old-fashioned counterintelligence measures such as conducting planning meetings in person and staying off digital communications whose signals the Israelis can track in favor of the hardwired phones in the tunnels.",5512,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-intelligence-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230627130758-rob-picheta-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,newspaper struck widely reporting increase thursday accuse aspirational knowledge wall matter kill criticism document country key translate biden poise dismiss warn official unclear told left backlash administration claimed minister authority assess refuse advance clear ahead network write sharp extent difficult complex jericho detailed base chief social outlet deadliest sheer cell group operating conflict forward rocket phone launch purport scale produce dark southern stay obtain military week strip give incursion battle hardwired possibility spark plan assessment communicate public reveals tracked violence secret outline share surprise defense seismic failure impend built operation planning city assault indicate major provide stream tactical border terror territory kind earlier continue prior fail interview unusual militant israel cia october receive york source carry tunnel government coordinate deem prime misstep conduct day target stayed hostage include overwhelm gaza activity community israeli attack september measure period digital evade lead favor line found escalate fortification time circulate number fighter activate meeting cnn wire describe small accord benjamin hid report track risk political scope purportedly operative counterintelligence avoid call security ripple late detection roughly year signal top indication follow date hundred review deter familiar underneath intelligence haaretz person night indicator suggest netanyahu medium email leader part multiple computer update answer precision hamas detail american post deadly point offer communication held prevent generally brutality month friday contrary meant responsibility,-0.987,0.2177068214804064,13.16059637912673,0.4144376091744511,0,2023-12-01
CNN,Opinion: Christopher Hitchens was right about Henry Kissinger,2023-12-01 15:58:00,Peter Bergen,"America is the “shining city on a hill,” a moral force for good whose ideals should be spread worldwide, according to the idealistic interpretation of US foreign policy.Backers of that view cite President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s push for the creation of the United Nations, President Harry Truman’s signing of the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe in the wake of World War II and President Jimmy Carter’s emphasis on a human rights-first foreign policy.Then there is the ‘realist’ school of US foreign policy, which puts America’s interests first, whose most recent exemplar is former President Donald Trump’s ‘America’s First’ foreign policy. No matter how poorly it was executed by Trump himself, this school argues that the US isn’t the world’s conscience or policeman and should take care of its own interests above all others.Henry Kissinger, who died at age 100 on Wednesday, was the apotheosis of the realist school of American foreign policy that puts perceived American interests first. And just as there are two schools of American foreign policy, there are also two schools of thought about Kissinger himself.One might be termed the Christopher Hitchens school. Hitchens was a prolific writer and author who argued that Kissinger was a “war criminal” who should be tried for war crimes. In 2001, Hitchens published a book arguing this case, “The Trial of Henry Kissinger.”The other school is how “The Blob” sees Kissinger. The Blob is the term coined by Ben Rhodes, former President Barack Obama’s deputy national security advisor, to describe the American foreign policy establishment whose badge of honor is membership of the Council on Foreign Relations. The Blob generally regards Kissinger as a foreign policy guru who got the big ideas right, such as his establishing relations between the US and communist China after decades of mutual hostility.So, which view is truer to history?To answer that question, we need to look at his actual record in office during the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, which has been partly obscured by Kissinger’s long post-government life as a foreign policy oracle whose advice was sought out by many American presidents.Any sober assessment of Kissinger’s actual record must surely conclude that Hitchens was more right than not.In 1971, Kissinger acquiesced as the Pakistani military killed hundreds of thousands, though the estimate is disputed, in what is now the country of Bangladesh, despite warnings from his own State Department officials that something akin to a genocide was unfolding.Two years later, Kissinger pushed Nixon to overthrow the democratically-elected socialist government of Salvador Allende in Chile. According to documents declassified by the National Security Archive Kissinger later told General Augusto Pinochet, who mounted the military coup that overthrew Allende, “You did a great service to the West in overthrowing Allende.”In Argentina in 1976, Kissinger secretly gave the green light to the military junta then in power to carry out what’s known as the “Dirty War” to kill between 10,000 to 30,000 of its political opponents, according to an account later posted on the CIA’s website.Kissinger was the key US player in ending American involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973. As a result of his peace deal with the North Vietnamese, Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Prize, but his legacy in Vietnam is decidedly mixed.Kissinger stepped up the secret American bombings of Vietnam’s neighbors Cambodia and Laos, causing untold misery in those countries that also helped to enable the rise of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. Cambodia is still ruled by the party of Hun Sen, an autocrat who was once part of the Khmer Rouge. (Sen stepped down in August, handing power over to his son.)Kissinger excluded the South Vietnamese from his peace negotiations with the North Vietnamese. Within two years of the Paris Peace Accords being concluded in 1973, the communist North Vietnamese had seized all of South Vietnam, and Vietnam today remains, at least nominally, a communist country, though now on friendly terms with the US.This has some echoes in how Trump excluded the Afghan government from the US 2020 deal with the Taliban that eventually removed thousands of US troops from Afghanistan, who were helping to keep the elected Afghan government in power.President Joe Biden then completed the Trump withdrawal plan in 2021, enabling the Taliban to seize the country where they have established their misogynistic theocracy.In the Economist, Kissinger wrote that this withdrawal from Afghanistan was a “self-inflicted setback” though he had done something similar during his peace negotiations with the North Vietnamese, which was to exclude a major party to the war, the government of South Vietnam, which was soon defeated once the US withdrew its forces from Vietnam.Kissinger deserves credit for his “shuttle diplomacy” to ease the hostilities between Egypt, Syria and Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but it was the one-time peanut farmer from Georgia, President Jimmy Carter, not Kissinger with his Harvard PhD in diplomatic history, who through his sheer force of will created the lasting peace between Egypt and Israel five years later at Camp David.Kissinger and President Richard Nixon did open the door to China — in order to undercut relations between the communist Chinese and the leaders of the Soviet Union — re-establishing American relations with the Chinese in 1972. In many ways, this was Kissinger’s greatest achievement as it helped China to rise and become the US’ largest trading partner. The US and China are now the world’s two largest economies.Yet China hasn’t liberalized as it has prospered. It has become increasingly authoritarian in recent years, putting into internment camps some more than a million Uyghurs, according to a UN report last year, extinguishing democracy in Hong Kong and creating a repressive mass surveillance state. The Biden administration concluded in its 2022 National Security Strategy that China is now “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge.”Kissinger traveled to China in June to perform a valedictory victory lap, where he was greeted as a returning hero by the Chinese regime, which he has often visited as the chairman of his consulting firm, Kissinger Associates.In some quarters, Kissinger is celebrated as a great diplomat, but his real legacy was creating a world that often sees, with good reason, that the United States will sometimes act in an amoral and duplicitous manner, and it is far from the “shining city on a hill” that it aspires to be and often imagines itself as.Of course, being clear-eyed about national interests is the responsibility of any leader, but for Kissinger, the ends almost always justified the means. Other American policy makers, from FDR to George Marshall to Carter, showed that the national interest and a higher moral purpose are not incompatible.",6971,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/opinions/henry-kissinger-war-criminal-christopher-hitchens-bergen/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150505110743-peter-bergen-profile.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1437,w_2554,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,truer allende economist honor donald truman consult matter kill document country publish key idealistic advice biden told argues official harvard europe akin advisor strategy administration party pinochet recent paris account criminal phd diplomacy repressive afghanistan coup exemplar rhodes chairman withdrawal exclude nation write order travel hitchens egypt communist regime augusto uyghurs signing partner realist push human prosper yom richard celebrate diplomat obscure put relation wednesday sheer sought visit trump surely perceive council act open rouge gerald chile increasingly marshall kissinger undercut declassify acquiesce former military reason give brutal extinguish surveillance nobel office consequential assessment plan afghan duplicitous player award secret prize nominally cambodia guru justified deserves henry service north kippur echo greet oracle foreign archive school policy elect incompatible mass city major peanut coin junta light misery eventually spread firm franklin mutual trading democracy negotiation israel view cia hand dirty remove diplomatic manner salvador deal million execute policeman defeat carry big establish enable christopher bombing america lao quarter history roosevelt camp president power government joe regard complete barack trial chinese rebuilt partly argentina idea ford great west withdrew peace jimmy troop term blob aspires vietnam book valedictory rule involvement authoritarian interest seize untold syria august june decade farmer crime show hong maker dispute geopolitical force kong actual china nixon emphasis wake fdr describe thousand mount shuttle credit georgia accord shin khmer bangladesh genocide misogynistic world report course political deputy remains age apotheosis prolific rise legacy worldwide hero pakistani estimate hostility vietnamese south security carter membership question socialist year opponent overthrow achievement long decidedly establishment general taliban today real hundred ideal harry national perform george case large record liberalize ease writer amoral warning green high state creation leader sober part similar secretly poorly return answer conscience friendly argue interpretation presidency american department neighbor victory despite post soviet obama overthrew badge autocrat generally internment purpose conclude hill result united create author setback union life responsibility step imago,0.9804,0.2151771625304834,11.18998410174881,0.3398464458247066,0,2023-12-01
CNN,Married to my rapist: The Indian women saying no,2023-12-01 15:00:00,Rhea Mogul,"Behind the closed doors of bedrooms across India, the anachronistic opinions of a 17th Century jurist still guide the rules of sex between husband and wife.Englishman Matthew Hale famously considered women to become their husband’s possession on marriage, a belief written into English common law, exported to the colonies and later abandoned over centuries in many countries – but not in India.Here, it’s not a crime for a man to force sex or sexual acts on his wife, as long as she is over 18.It’s almost impossible to know what happens inside marital homes in the world’s most populous country, and the intimate discussions that may or may not occur before either party initiates sex.But experts say India’s patriarchal society demands certain behavior from wives, and often that means a wife must comply with her husband’s wishes, whether she’s a willing partner or not.Campaigners have been trying to change the law for years, but they say they’re up against conservatives who argue that state interference could destroy the tradition of marriage in India.Last year, the Delhi High Court delivered a split verdict on the issue, prompting lawyers to file an appeal in the country’s Supreme Court that is expected to be heard soon.CNN spoke with three women, contacted through social workers and non-government agencies, who accuse their husbands of rape. None of the women want to be named, and are using aliases to avoid repercussions.Maya was 19 and in love when she married a man she’d met in college.Unlike many Indian marriages, hers was not arranged, and her mother didn’t approve.Maya moved in with her husband but said the family matriarch took an instant dislike to her because she comes from a lower caste. In India’s social heirarchy, some people are considered more worthy than others despite laws that seek to end caste-based discrimination.“His grandmother wouldn’t eat from the utensils I cooked with or touched, drink water from a glass I brought her. She put me down in every way – the way I spoke, the way I dressed.“This is why my husband and I fought a lot,” said Maya, now 21. “He told me to compromise and do what his family said. I would tell him to stand up for me, but he wouldn’t.”Maya gripped her hands tightly as she told of the mental and physical abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband.In late 2021, she said her husband forced himself on her for one last time.“I told him, ‘do you know what they call this? It’s called rape.’ And he said, ‘yes, I know I am raping you. You’re right. I’m raping you. Tell the authorities if you want to.’”She didn’t, but the next day, she packed her bags and left after two years of marriage.“I want him to be punished. I want him to serve time for his crime,” Maya said. “Until he gets punished, he will never know or realize what he has done wrong.”In 2017, in an open letter published by Vogue, lawyer Karuna Nundy urged women across the country to “know your power.”“Your right to say yes comes with the right to say no,” she wrote, urging survivors to immediately report the rape to police, go to hospital to preserve the evidence, and call a lawyer. “Shame belongs to criminals, not survivors of crime,” she wrote.Not long before, a married woman approached Nundy and told her that her husband had raped her every night since they got married.Nundy agreed to help her leave him, but the lawyer didn’t want to stop there – she wanted to change the law that gives men impunity to rape within marriage.“Some issues are visceral, they don’t need thinking about,” Nundy told CNN from her office in New Delhi. “This is one of them.”In his criminal law treatise, Hale wrote that marital rape could not be considered a crime.“For by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract, the wife hath given herself up in this kind unto the husband which she cannot retract,” he wrote in “The History of the Pleas of the Crown,” published in 1736, six decades after his death.Nearly three centuries later, Hale’s views on marriage, rape and even abortions, are still cited in courtrooms around the world, including in the United States.The ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade last year, turning back the clock on women’s rights to seek an abortion in the US, mentioned Hale’s name at least a dozen times.Marital rape was still legal in some US states up until 1993, and it was only outlawed in Britain after a landmark court ruling in 1991.Across the world, 43 countries still do not have legislation that addresses the issue of marital rape – and among those that do, the penalties for non-consensual sex within marriage are “significantly lower” than other rape cases, according to the United Nations Population Fund’s 2021 State of World Population review.Women alleging rape in India have some avenues of potential legal action against their husbands.For example, they can seek a restraining order under civil law or charges under Section 354 of India’s Penal Code, which covers sexual assault short of rape, and Section 498A, which covers domestic violence.These laws are open to interpretation and judges can impose prison sentences for sexual assault in cases where a married woman has alleged rape. But many don’t, Nundy said.“They say, ‘if rape is exempt, then why should we find a way to use criminal law to deal with it?’” Nundy said, adding that the law must be “specifically tailored to cover the prohibited act.”“Otherwise nobody gets justice. Neither the victim, nor the alleged perpetrator,” she said.Married women are also “ignored” when they try to file a police complaint, Nundy added.A study published in the National Library of Medicine journal “Sexual and Reproductive Health Matters” last year suggested the same.The study examined records from three Mumbai public hospitals from 2008 to 2017 and found that of 1,664 rape survivors, no rape cases were filed by police.At least 18 of those women reported marital rape to the police, including 10 women who alleged rape by a former partner or husband.Indian law allows for rape charges against a partner if the couple is separated, but according to the study, those charges weren’t pursued.Four women were explicitly told by police that they could not do anything as marital rape was not a crime.“The inadequate police response is of concern as all the women had suffered severe violence,” the report said.Softly spoken and shy, Vidya says she never wanted a husband, but her father told her she didn’t have a choice and arranged for her to marry at 19.She was not taught about sex before her wedding night.“I became scared because I did not know him,” Vidya said. “I did not say anything – not no, not yes – and he never asked.”Several years into their marriage, Vidya gave birth to a boy, and she says her husband’s demands became more violent, and he would beat her if she refused sex.With nowhere else to turn, Vidya approached a non-government organization, whose workers gave a name to her experience.Vidya briefly thought about leaving her husband, she said, going as far as taking her son to her mother’s house for a short period of time. But in the end, she said she realized she wanted to stay with him and proposed they attend marriage counseling.He agreed, and they’re still together. “He has learned to communicate better. We don’t have problems,” Vidya, now 37, said.She thinks rape within marriage should be criminalized – though she doesn’t want her husband jailed.“I don’t want to send my husband to jail because he is good now,” she said. “But this law will give women the strength to come forward and stop their abuse.”Nusrat’s husband is the son of a family friend who had badgered her parents to allow him to marry her, though he lived far away and was short of money.“Initially my parents said no for the marriage, but he would harass us daily, and he would send his grandmother to our house, and she would say that my grandson says that if I don’t get to marry her, I will take my own life,” said Nusrat.Nusrat moved from her village to live with his family, where she discovered he was a heavy drinker who would beat her and steal from others because he didn’t have a job.Once she even had to sell her jewelry to bail him out of jail, she said.Sex became a point of friction between them – he wanted it, she didn’t.Nusrat didn’t refer to what happened to her as rape, but the law states that a man commits the offense against a woman if she doesn’t give her free consent – except if she’s his wife.Now 33 years old, Nusrat is too scared to leave her husband because she has no way to support their three children.“I am not educated. I did not study. I cannot work or earn money for myself,” she said. “I continue to live under his roof for the sake of my kids, no other reason.”She said this is why she believes marital rape should be outlawed throughout India.“We need it for women like me, who don’t have an avenue to leave,” she said.A ceiling fan hums in a room in a suburb of western Delhi, where about 10 women sit in a circle, dressed in shalwar kameez, a traditional Indian tunic with a scarf.They have been invited here by social workers who go house-to-house building trust with women and teaching them about women’s safety and how to seek help.CNN has agreed to change the names of the women – all wives of migrant workers from neighboring states – because talking about sex is taboo in India and they fear backlash from their families.Of the 10 women CNN spoke with, at least four were in marriages arranged by their parents before they turned 18 – a decision they said they could not refuse. Only two women chose their husbands themselves. All but one had children.According to the 2019-2021 National Family Health Survey by the Government of India, 17.6% of more than 100,000 women ages 15-49 surveyed said they were unable to say no to their husband if they didn’t want sex, while 11% thought husbands were justified in hitting or beating his wife if she refused.Rani, 26, said she has no choice but to have sex with her husband when he wants it.Priti, a 30-year-old mother of four, said she had no idea what sex was until their wedding night, when her husband showed her a pornographic video and told her to recreate it.None of the women said their husbands hit them, but believed sex was an act of duty to be performed as a wife. Rape was seen as a violent act by a stranger.“The patriarchal system has given men a privilege,” said Jaya Velankar, the director of Jagori, a non-profit organization that educates women about their rights and advocates on their behalf.“He can lift his hand, he can hit you or he can throw tantrums, he can verbally abuse you. And nobody questions it. Because that is how we are indoctrinated right from childhood.”Since Indian courts began hearing the cases to criminalize marital rape, a slew of men’s rights activists have taken their objections to the streets and social media.The Save Indian Family Foundation group has been among the most vocal, claiming women could misuse the law to falsely imprison men.In March, the group, which claims to have 100,000 members, called for “nationwide protests against Marital Rape law and Supreme Court of India,” writing on Twitter – now known as X – that they are “ready to (un) leash hell on the system the day first fake marital rape case gets filed.”CNN has reached out to the group.According to the 2019-2021 National Family Health Survey, 9.7% of more than 90,000 men ages 15-49 surveyed believed a husband was justified in hitting or beating his wife if she refused sex, while 12.2% said husbands had the right to use force if his wife refused sex.CNN asked dozens of men on the streets of Delhi for their views on marital rape and consent.Alok Singh, a 21-year-old law student, said criminalizing marital rape would “empower” women to speak out.“It is required,” he said. “We are seeing that marital rape cases are increasing, and people are voicing their concerns.”But most men CNN spoke to said marital law should not be outlawed.Rajeev Verma, a 43-year-old self-employed worker, said such a law would create “discomfort in marriages.”A 52-year-old taxi driver, Ramdev Yadav, said a law against marital rape could deter people from marriage.“Sex should not be forced, but no one will marry if this law is introduced,” he said.One of the lawyers fighting to criminalize rape within marriage, senior Supreme Court advocate Colin Gonsalves, says the evidence from other jurisdictions suggests that married women won’t be rushing to file criminal complaints against their husbands.“On the contrary, while women know they have a right, they are afraid of going to court,” he told CNN. “This is pretty conclusive evidence that instead of a backlash, even with the change in the law, the change on the ground is going to be very slow.”Still, he said, “It is the most significant step in India to stop men from forcing themselves on women to whom they are married.”It has been more than a year since New Delhi’s High Court delivered a split verdict on whether marital rape should be outlawed.Justice Rajiv Shakdher ruled in favor of criminalization, saying failing to protect married women violates the Indian Constitution.Justice Hari Shankar disagreed.“A husband may, on occasion, compel his wife to have sex with him, though she may not be inclined,” Shankar wrote in his judgment. “Can it be said, with even a modicum of propriety, that her experience is the same as that of a woman who is ravaged by a stranger?”The decision, when it comes, will affect hundreds of millions of people in India for generations to come.Advocates say even if wives don’t use the legal system to try to punish husbands who rape, the power to do so should impress on the nation that sex within marriage is a choice, not a right.For Nundy, empowering women in marriage would show that India had moved on from its colonial past, casting aside the views of Hale, a man who died more than three centuries ago.The campaign for women’s rights isn’t intended to create societal conflict, she added.“This is not a fight of women against men,” Nundy said. “This is a fight of people against patriarchy.”",14129,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/india/india-marital-rape-fight-to-criminalize-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220830172618-rhea-mogul-byline-2022.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International

ABC,"Putin orders the Russian military to add 170,000 troops for a total of 1.32 million",2023-12-01 14:30:00,The Associated Press,"MOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday ordered the country's military to increase the number of troops by nearly 170,000 to a total of 1.32 million, as Moscow’s military action in Ukraine continues into its 22nd month.Putin's decree was released by the Kremlin on Friday and took force immediately. It brings the overall number of Russian military personnel to about 2.2 million, including 1.32 million troops.It is the second such expansion of the army since 2018. The previous boost by 137,000 troops, ordered by Putin in August 2022, put the military's numbers at about 2 million personnel and about 1.15 million troops.The Defense Ministry said the order doesn't imply any “significant expansion of conscription,” saying in a statement that the increase would happen gradually by recruiting more volunteers. The ministry cited what it called “the special military operation” in Ukraine and the expansion of NATO as the reasons for beefing up the army.NATO's ""joint armed forces are being built up near Russia’s borders and additional air defense systems and strike weapons are being deployed. The potential of NATO’s tactical nuclear forces is being increased,"" the statement read.Boosting Russian troops is an appropriate response to ""the aggressive activities of the NATO bloc,” the ministry said.Last December, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared that the country needed a force of 1.5 million “to guarantee the fulfillment of tasks to ensure Russia’s security.” He didn't say when the military would reach that size.The Kremlin previously considered the size of its military as sufficient, but the calculus changed after hopes for a quick victory over its neighbor were shattered by fierce Ukrainian resistance.Amid the continued hostilities, Russia and Ukraine both have kept a tight lid of secrecy on their military casualties. The Russian military has confirmed only just over 6,000 military casualties, but the West had much higher estimates. In October, the U.K. Defense Ministry tweeted in a regular update that Russia has “likely suffered 150,000-190,000 permanent casualties,” a number that included troops that have been killed and permanently wounded.The Russian authorities have undertaken various efforts to give a boost to the army.In August 2022, Putin ordered an increase in the size of the Russian military to 1.15 million starting from Jan. 1, 2023. The following month, he ordered the mobilization of 300,000 reservists to beef up his forces in Ukraine. That number is counted as part of the military’s current strength.While Putin said there was no need to round up more, his mobilization decree is open-ended, allowing the military to call up additional reservists when needed. That decree also banned volunteer soldiers from ending their contracts.Regional authorities have tried to help beef up the ranks by forming volunteer battalions for deployment to Ukraine. All across Russia's vast territory, a campaign to entice more men to enlist has been underway for months, with advertisements promise cash bonuses, recruiters making cold calls to eligible men and enlistment offices working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed.The deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said Friday that more than 452,000 men have enlisted into the army as contract soldiers this year.Some media reports and rights groups say that the Russian authorities also offer amnesty to prisoners in exchange for a tour of military duty.These efforts come on top of the regular draft, which calls up around 120,000-140,000 men twice a year for a one-year tour of compulsory service. The authorities insist that those conscripted for mandatory service aren't being deployed to Ukraine.All Russian men from age 18 to 27 must serve one year in the military, but a large share avoid the draft for health reasons or deferments granted to university students. The share of men who avoid the draft is particularly big in Moscow and other major cities. This year, the authorities raised the upper age limit for mandatory service to 30 starting from Jan. 1.",4141,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-orders-russian-military-add-170000-troops-total-105314951,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/75d46774-724b-4271-8e71-7d88767f6010/wirestory_a2bf0b035aabab20c8b120a1c86c9e38_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make increase cold compulsory tweet kill country permanently agency secrecy mobilization significant beef quick confirm special minister ukraine ministry advertisement nato authority round ban statement order action amnesty consider insist ensure deployment continued undertaken social put reservist entice group fierce council air weapon suffer eligible conscript serve putin volunteer total nuclear military vast exchange reason enlistment give moscow soldier fulfillment office sufficient bonus share service defense prisoner student current deferment built operation tight city permanent major university tactical border territory raise continue lid deployed personnel gradually october million casualty promise imply additional big medvedev president reach strike underway expansion appropriate west include activity troop army brings conscription mandatory vladimir joint decree russian declare previous limit number shoigu august happen previously chair ukrainian force draft response cash health work battalion size calculus report guarantee deputy age estimate recruiting hostility effort sergei change call security avoid year top follow grant lure release tour immediately large campaign hope rank regular high boost arm system medium december part update recruiter task contract potential count russia shatter neighbor victory form aggressive enlist bloc offer particularly dmitry upper month friday start kremlin,0.4118,0.2173388070514368,12.183277777777777,0.2913778529163144,0,2023-12-01
ABC,Kenyan cult leader sentenced to 18 months for film violations but still not charged over mass graves,2023-12-01 14:21:00,EMMANUEL IGUNZA Associated Press,"NAIROBI, Kenya -- The leader of a doomsday cult in Kenya was sentenced Friday to 18 months in prison for the illegal distribution of films and operating a film studio without licenses.The senior magistrate in the city of Malindi, Olga Onalo, handed down the sentence for Paul Mackenzie. The controversial preacher can appeal within 14 days.Mackenzie was found guilty last month of exhibition of films through his Times Television network without approval of the Kenya Film Classification Board in charges dating back to 2019.He pleaded not guilty to the charges saying he didn’t know he required a license to distribute films.Mackenzie had been accused of using the TV channel and his sermons to radicalize children and parents against Western education and medicine. Prosecutors also alleged that some of his followers had refused to go to school or attend hospitals when sick. He was acquitted of those charges.The preacher has been in police custody since April, when he was arrested in connection with the discovery of more than 400 bodies in mass graves on his church property.

ABC,Bombs are falling on Gaza again. Who are the hostages still remaining in the besieged strip?,2023-12-01 14:08:00,JULIA FRANKEL Associated Press,"JERUSALEM -- A weeklong cease-fire that brought the exchanges of dozens of hostages held by Hamas for scores of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel gave way Friday morning to resumed fighting between Israel and Hamas. As mediators scuttle between the warring sides in a last-ditch effort to broker another swap, questions emerge on who remains in captivity in the besieged enclave.Hamas and other militants seized around 247 hostages in their deadly Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which more than 1,200 people were killed. Israel has pummeled the Gaza Strip in return, killing at least 13,300 people, two-thirds of them women and children, according to health authorities in the Hamas-ruled territory.Here's a closer look at the fate of the hostages.Israel said on Friday that 136 hostages remain in Gaza. They include 119 men and 17 women and children, according to military spokesperson Daniel Hagari. Roughly 10 of the hostages are 75 and older, the Prime Minister's Office said Friday.The vast majority are Israeli while 11 are foreign nationals, including eight from Thailand, one from Nepal and Tanzania each, and one French-Mexican.Earlier, government spokesperson Eylon Levy listed the youngest hostage, 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, his 4-year-old brother Ariel and their mother Shiri as still being among the hostages. The military has said it's investigating a Hamas claim that the boys and their mother were killed in an Israeli airstrike.Hagari provided no information about the three.Families of hostages who have not been released are still waiting in desperation, calling on the government to bring their loved ones home.They hear reports from the families of recently freed hostages that conditions are difficult and worry their loved ones do not have sufficient food and water. They plead with the Red Cross to bring their relatives badly needed medicine. They agonize as mere crumbs of information about their relatives surface.Sharone Lifschitz, whose mother was freed in October, heard this week that a returned hostage had seen her father, 83-year-old Oded Lifshitz, in captivity. Her father, who spells the family name differently, was last seen shot while militants carted him off to Gaza.She says the news was a “ray of light” but that she wonders if it's still true.“My father is ill, is frail. He needs medicine,” she said. “I don't know how long he can survive in such harsh conditions.""She said the return of women and children hostages has been bittersweet as their husbands and fathers remain in captivity. The idea that children would be able to recover from captivity while their fathers remain hostages was ""unthinkable,” she added.As the cease-fire waned, the military said Friday that four hostages were reported to have died in captivity, including the oldest person held hostage.All the four, 56-year old Maya Goren, 86-year old Arye Zalmanovich, 54-year-old Ronan Engel, and 75-year-old Eliyahu Margalit, were from Kibbutz Nir Oz. The kibbutz was devastated in the attack, with roughly a quarter of its people killed or kidnapped.On Thursday, the military announced the death of Ofir Tzarfati, another Israeli believed to have been held hostage. Two other hostages have died in Hamas captivity since Oct. 7, according to the military.Officials have said little about how the deaths were determined but the army has said it has collected valuable information from the returned hostages.Zalmanovich, a father of two and grandfather of five, was a founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a statement from the missing families group said. Goren was a mother of four and a kindergarten teacher for the kibbutz. Her husband was killed by Hamas militants on Oct. 7.Engel, a father of three, was a photographer and volunteer paramedic whose wife and two daughters were released from Gaza this week, the group said.The group did not immediately release information on Margalit.During the cease-fire, some 110 hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza were returned to their families, Israel's government said Friday. They include 86 Israeli citizens and 24 foreign nationals, most of them Thais.The returnees have mostly appeared in stable health condition, able to walk and speak normally though many lost weight in captivity. One 84-year-old hostage returned in critical condition after not receiving proper medical care, doctors said. Another came back on crutches.Families have greeted the return of their loved ones with joy and excitement, but doctors have warned of the psychological toll of captivity and say they face a long road to recovery.",4569,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bombs-falling-gaza-hostages-remaining-besieged-strip-105314086,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/28fabbf4-2773-4da6-a26f-a291e8e8aead/wirestory_d760e0b30a5fc8bb29623ee350ce0668_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain palestinian thursday kill back badly dozen recovery excitement morning kfir ofir warn minister zalmanovich nepal mediator emerge authority ronan engel worry oz oded announce child news margalit statement relative difficult love majority pummel arye maya jerusalem stable nir shiri tzarfati wan death kindergarten group brother wait ray bibas southern cart volunteer young resume exchange military vast week strip joy give office ariel daniel photographer sufficient medical weight lose proper wife greet prisoner foreign daughter miss cross believe crumb provide valuable unthinkable captivity swap hear light militant condition freed israel scuttle grandfather october receive bring eliyahu quarter government devastate prime collect idea score closer hostage gaza include citizen israeli levy army red attack founder spokesperson returnees doctor seize differently thailand food investigate plead desperation fate psychological recently boy goren teacher kibbutz health fight critical accord water tanzania lifshitz besiege bittersweet report side information survive heard remains woman spell brought effort call medicine walk question roughly long paramedic toll lifschitz determine frail eylon husband national release speak immediately recover person harsh mother father shot return hagari hamas road wonder claim list deadly agonize family held broker friday weeklong,-0.98405,0.3939592908732764,11.579031055900618,0.3821212121212121,0,2023-12-01
CNN,"Chinstrap penguins survive on more than 10,000 naps a day, study finds",2023-12-01 11:56:00,Amarachi Orie,"The art of nodding off appears to have been mastered by breeding chinstrap penguins, who take more than 10,000 naps a day, with each nap lasting an average of four seconds, according to a new study.The animals accumulate around 11 hours of sleep daily using this strategy, challenging a pattern observed in humans that fragmentation is detrimental to sleep quality.“Microsleeps” or “micronaps” – seconds-long interruptions of wakefulness, which include eye closure and sleep-related brain activity – occur in humans who have had insufficient sleep, according to the study published in journal Science on Thursday.However, nodding off can be inappropriate and even dangerous in certain environments, such as when driving a car, and it is unclear whether they are long enough to provide any of the benefits of sleep.To investigate whether microsleeps can provide any sleep functions and be a useful sleeping method in ecological circumstances that require constant vigilance, researchers in France, South Korea and Germany studied 14 wild chinstrap penguins who were incubating eggs in a colony exposed to a predatory bird, the brown skua, on King George Island, Antarctica, in December 2019.During incubation, when skuas are known to prey on penguin eggs, one penguin parent is forced to guard the eggs or small chicks continuously while their partner is away foraging for several days, according to the study. They must also defend their nest site from intruding penguins, all while simultaneously needing to sleep.The researchers identified their peculiar sleep patterns using remote electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and other non-invasive sensors to record brain activity, muscle tone, movement, position and temperature, as well as continuous video and direct observations.They observed that the penguins in the colony engaged in more than 600 bouts of microsleep an hour.The study authors said that “thousands of microsleeps lasting only 4 (seconds) is unprecedented, even among penguins.”A small 1984 study found that captive little penguins put into metabolic chambers exhibited a state called “quiet wakefulness,” which resembles the microsleep of the chinstrap penguins. However, these bouts of sleep lasted much longer at 42 seconds on average.A 1986 study found captive, nonbreeding emperor penguins to have fragmented sleep called “drowsiness,” which also resembles the microsleep pattern of the breeding chinstrap penguins. However, the emperor penguins only spent up to 14% of the time in that state.In this study, 75% of sleep among chinstrap penguins was in episodes lasting less than 10 seconds, according to study coauthor and sleep ecophysiologist Paul-Antoine Libourel, who pilots and manages projects as part of the sleep team at the Neuroscience Research Centre of Lyon.“This is not unique across the animal kingdom. There (are) other animals that are sleeping quite fragmented or in very short bursts of sleep. But, to our knowledge, they were not able to sustain such extreme sleep fragmentation of days and hours, day and night, and continuously (as these penguins). And this is what was very interesting in our findings,” Libourel told CNN Friday.He added that through these short bursts of sleep the penguins could “sleep and remain vigilant” while incubating.The researchers observed that even after the penguins had swapped with their partner to forage for food at sea, they slept in the same pattern upon their return to shore.However, the bouts of sleep would last longer during their first hours back on land, indicating that the penguins needed to recover from losing sleep at sea, where they spend a lot of time actively awake doing activities such as diving.The researchers also compared the sleep of those nesting in the center of the colony to those on the border, who are more exposed to predatory skuas and therefore need to remain more vigilant.Those nesting at the border slept more deeply and had longer and fewer bouts of sleep than those at the center of the colony, which Libourel said “was quite unexpected” and “the reverse” of what they thought they’d find.He put this down to a “noisy and disturbing environment” at the center of the colony due to a lot of penguins moving around, with those heading to the sea passing by the nests of the penguins incubating, making it a difficult environment to sleep in. Aggression among penguins and other interactions were also said to add to this.Despite not directly measuring the restorative value of microsleeps, the researchers inferred that “the chinstrap penguins’ large investment in microsleeps,” and “their ability to successfully breed, despite sleeping in this highly fragmented manner,” suggests that “microsleeps can fulfill at least some of the restorative functions of sleep.”They concluded that other animals might also have “the flexibility to partition sleep into short or long bouts, depending on their ecological demands for vigilance.”Libourel said that they do not yet know how physiologically these penguins are able to sleep in this way and warned that sleeping in short bursts is not advisable for humans, since we do not have the same physiology as chinstrap penguins and we do not know whether sleep functions in the same way for us.Rather, the study shows that “some sleep pattern that could be bad for us – I mean, that could induce some pathology that we cannot sustain – for other animals, could be an adaptation and help them for surviving,” he added.Libourel said there is still a “big gap” in our understanding of the role of sleep, and the impact of human disturbance and climate change on sleep and animal life. “I think that’s why it’s important to study sleep. Sleep is a central in animal behavior,” he added.In a perspective published in Science, Christian Harding, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, San Diego, and Vladyslav Vyazovskiy, a professor of sleep physiology at the University of Oxford, wrote that the study “calls into question not only the current understanding of how sleep architecture is regulated but also the extent to which it can be altered before the benefits of sleep are lost.”They added that climate change and human activity “are applying increasing pressure on natural habitats,” which are “affecting the amount and the quality of sleep in wild animals.”They said sleep studies such as this one “are the best way to exploit opportunities to study sleep in wild animals free from human influence while it is still possible.”",6503,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/world/chinstrap-penguins-microsleep-study-intl-scli-scn/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230427164022-20230427-cte-background-2023-full-169.jpg?q=h_900,w_1600,x_0,y_0/w_1280",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain make increase hour investment knowledge challenge method back movement car publish wild burst spent temperature told unclear warn strategy ecological research team skua electroencephalogram continuous pressure disturbance suggests continuously animal dangerous understand guard restorative write daily compare extent difficult partner regulate colony pilot drive human climate advisable deeply infer observe head behavior eeg put neuroscience physiology episode intrude flexibility incubate value antarctica aggression predatory possible environment vigilant lot land captive occur disturb micronaps vigilance chamber identify add libourel extreme central penguin microsleeps lose constant center postdoctoral interruption chick science direct current tone indicate provide university border closure swap bird unprecedented video longer forage king ability muscle function remote manner move unexpected highly big simultaneously site ecophysiologist successfully fragmentation average impact passing affect architecture egg breed nonbreeding france inappropriate day study kingdom interaction include activity quality centre monitoring away nest measure accumulate apply found drowsiness vyazovskiy metabolic sleep oxford gap natural free interest time food investigate emperor amount induce nod opportunity pattern show peculiar due force master california diego parent brown reverse cnn coauthor thousand professor journal small accord engage actively san survive chinstrap germany physiologically art circumstance change important south pathology call brain question wakefulness perspective long finding partition scholar resembles awake insufficient vladyslav require fulfill george benefit record large expose island exploit microsleep korea depend recover spend christian position habitat role night state unique short alter fragment researcher december part slept return noisy influence despite directly eye breeding quiet harding adaptation prey incubation project sensor conclude bout manages defend author exhibit demand nap detrimental life sustain,0.93785,0.3229278794402583,11.32136170212766,0.4360205781216418,0,2023-12-01
Chicago Tribune,"Viral photo of two families in 2017 symbolized peace among Muslims, Jews. Now they comfort each other amid the Israel-Hamas war.",2023-12-01 05:00:00,Angie Leventis Lourgos,"The photograph went viral, instantly becoming a symbol of interfaith unity and a beacon of hope amid turmoil.A Muslim father and his young daughter connected with a Jewish dad and son in a chance encounter at O’Hare International Airport in 2017, while taking part in a protest of then-President Donald Trump’s travel ban targeting Muslim-majority nations.Rabbi Jordan Bendat-Appell hoisted his then-9-year-old son Adin onto his shoulders when the boy asked for a better look at the demonstration. Around the same time, Fatih Yildirim also lifted his daughter Meryem onto his shoulders, when the 7-year-old became tired.A Chicago Tribune photographer captured an iconic image of that moment, as one child smiled at the other above the crowd, Adin wearing a yarmulke and Meryem wearing a hijab.Although they were strangers before that day, the photo that swept the Internet also brought the Yildirim and Bendat-Appell families together. A few days after the protest, they shared a Shabbat dinner, to celebrate peace. And they have remained friends since despite their different backgrounds, cultures and faiths.Recently, a small gesture of compassion from one of the fathers offered a great deal of comfort to the other, as his family endured tragedy during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 and thrust the region into a bloody war.The horror overseas became very personal for the rabbi, whose wife’s cousin was among those slain in the act of terror: The 33-year-old woman was shot in front of her 4-year-old son and baby, though the children survived, according to media reports.When Fatih learned the news through social media posts, he called Jordan and “passed my condolences (on) to his wife.”He added that he unequivocally condemned the act of violence.“How would any of us feel?” Fatih said in a recent phone interview. “I was devastated.”The small act of kindness from Fatih meant so much to Jordan in this period of grief.The rabbi says that in times of darkness, the Jewish tradition “teaches us that we have to start to bring about more light.”“When you’re in darkness, it may be hard to imagine a room full of light,” he said in a recent phone interview. “But you actually don’t have to start with a room full of light. Just start with one small candle.”That call from Fatih “was like one small light that really meant a lot to me,” he added.The fathers recalled that the photo from 2017 had become deeply meaningful to so many people during a tumultuous time in national history.The demonstration they attended at O’Hare was in opposition to one of Trump’s first acts as president in early 2017, an executive order prohibiting refugees from coming to the United States for 120 days and barring citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the country for 90 days.The order, often dubbed the “Muslim travel ban,” was widely decried as discriminatory against Muslims and refugees by civil liberty experts and immigration advocates. Protests similar to the one at O’Hare swarmed airports across the country.Trump had first announced plans for the ban while campaigning as the leading Republican presidential candidate in 2015.Jordan, who lived in Deerfield at the time, had told the Tribune he brought his son to the protest to teach him to stand up for his beliefs. The boy’s grandparents are Holocaust survivors who had spent time in refugee camps, and the rabbi emphasized the importance of “remembering our history for the sake of acting out in this world today,” according to a Tribune story.Fatih, who was born in Turkey and lived in Schaumburg at the time, came to the airport with his wife and four children to bring cookies to attorneys who were giving free law services to international travelers who had been detained.The two bearded dads with glasses each held signs bearing parallel messages.Jordan’s sign read, “We’ve seen this before. Never again. Jews against the ban,” flanked by a Star of David on each side.Fatih’s sign simply stated “empathy.”Both men had received many calls from loved ones and acquaintances about the photograph. Within about a day, the picture was reposted more than 16,000 times on Twitter, the social media site now known as X. The photo made headlines in national and international news outlets as well. Time magazine listed the image among the top viral photos of 2017.The world is, in many ways, different now compared with when the photo was taken. President Joe Biden revoked the travel ban on his first day in office in 2021, fulfilling a campaign vow.The two kids in the photo were thrilled at the news.“Finally, Trump’s gone,” Meryem had told the Tribune at the time. “(There will be) more equality and just less crazy things happening.”Adin had also rejoiced.“As a Jew, if that happened against Jews, I would feel so angry. And it wasn’t fair at all, and we’re all humans at the end,” he had said. “With the Yildirims, we’re good friends, and I really disagreed with it and I’m so happy it’s over.”Yet echoes of Trump’s travel ban recently reverberated in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, as the 2024 presidential election looms.A few days after the Oct. 7 attack, Trump — once again the Republican front-runner in the upcoming race for president — promised to ban refugees from Gaza and immediately expand his 2017 Muslim travel ban if elected.“We’ll do it again,” Trump said while campaigning in Iowa in October, during a speech that drew cheers from the crowd. “We’ll put it right back into place.”The fathers believe the 2017 photograph — as well as the enduring bond between the two families that the image forged — resonates just as strongly today amid the war in the Middle East and its repercussions worldwide, which include a horrific recent rise in Islamophobia and antisemitism.For Jordan, his family’s enduring friendship with the Yildirims became even more powerful than the symbolism of the picture.“It was moving to me how that photo spoke to so many people,” Jordan said. “It was profound for me to know that it was much more than an image. An image represents something ... but behind that was actually a genuine connection. So that always made me feel really proud.”After the photo went viral, the Yildirims and Bendat-Appells went on to share more moments together, including a meal to break the Ramadan fast, a Passover celebration and a 5K walk for peace outside the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Skokie.The families often reach out to one another after horrific events that target Jewish or Muslim communities, such as the 2018 mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and an earthquake in Turkey earlier this year.The Bendat-Appell family moved to Toronto a few years ago. The Yildirim family now lives in the Indianapolis area. The kids in the photograph are teenagers. Jordan jokes he can no longer lift his son onto his shoulders, as he did in the photograph.Yet the families have still kept in touch long-distance over the years, with occasional emails around the holidays or messages on social media.“From the beginning, one thing I loved about the connection with Fatih and his family is that it’s just human. ... We’re coming together as two different human beings who happen to like each other and connect with each other as any two human beings,” Jordan said. “It just happens he’s Muslim; I’m Jewish. We care about things. We love our families. We love our people. And my heart’s broken about what’s going on (in the world), on many levels.”Both men hope for peace in the Middle East and around the globe.After the Oct. 7 massacre, Israeli airstrikes pounded the Gaza Strip. More than 5,300 Palestinian children have reportedly been killed in the war, according to UNICEF.For most of the past week, Israel and Hamas were under a temporary cease-fire truce amid a hostage exchange. On Friday Israel resumed attacking Gaza and claimed Hamas violated the truce. Hamas said Israel declined offers to free more hostages.Antisemitism has surged following the war, with the Anti-Defamation League tracking 300 antisemitic incidents in just over two weeks following the Hamas attack, a 388% rise compared to the same period in 2022. An ADL report released Wednesday showed that 73% of Jewish college students surveyed said they had seen or experienced some form of antisemitism since the start of this school year.Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiment have also recently spiked locally and around the globe.In a high-profile case, a 6-year-old Muslim child was slain and his mother was wounded in an October stabbing in Will County. In connection to the attack, the family’s landlord pleaded not guilty to murder, hate crime and other charges; authorities have said the landlord was motivated by listening to conservative talk radio discussions about the Israel-Hamas war.More recently, three college students of Palestinian descent were shot and seriously injured Saturday in Vermont. Police said the young men were speaking both English and Arabic and two were wearing Palestinian kaffiyeh scarves, according to The Associated Press; a suspect has pleaded not guilty and authorities were investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime.Since the war began, Fatih has been more worried about the safety and security of his family, he said.“But this is America, so there’s rule of law in this country,” he said. “So I’m not worried about it so much, I’m not thinking about leaving America or anything. But it’s just kind of hard.”He added that he’s optimistic “some kind of diplomacy will win over this violent cycle, this endless violent cycle in the Middle East that’s kind of affecting everyone around the world.”Jordan said his “heart is broken about Oct. 7 and all the loss around it.”Yet the rabbi invoked the Biblical verse from Leviticus, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”He explained that there are two parts to that command.“The second part is that you have to love yourself and you have to love your people and stand up for your family,” he said. “And the other part of it is that we have to love others. I think all of us can challenge ourselves — on both sides of this equation — can I love more?”When the world feels scary, humans have a tendency to build walls for self-protection, he added. Yet he encourages people to “find other human beings to connect with, including people who are different.”“Ultimately, we can’t all live in a world that’s just filled with walls,” he added.The Associated Press contributed.eleventis@chicagotribune.com",10540,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-viral-photo-muslim-jewish-israel-hamas-20231201-tkbqs4fovndpvoioqcbkf6zarm-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/hTbMv1Wj7HAZ2TQvWh7EAQ2pAik=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/WCA7VCXQJVEJPCKDXLW4B53VRA.jpg,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,protest violent meant listen stranger pass conservative tradition cooky human deerfield powerful recently dad discussion personal executive great terror meryem start peace stand boy teenager endure celebration held passover form period rule hope holocaust belief ramadan moment build israeli family photograph profound injured candidate echo believe camp descent bearing chicago charge bloody touch rabbi predominantly viral illinois wednesday investigate imagine social reposted biden invoked follow shoot announce back front condemn teach sentiment put yildirims center chance past part amid star kind outlet encounter tree message genuine interfaith security swept campaign airport presidential iowa shoulder release add expert bar headline gaza site unity widely dinner plan move toronto magazine find resume recall israel earlier overseas baby service include attorney advocate massacre civil law compassion yildirim bond child speech antisemitic race interview darkness father wound stab call mother scarf college friend room news emphasize acquaintance wife lead spike importance background national spent neighbor president horror horrific locally revoke leave sake case earthquake lot county press week shabbat temporary smile authority side share leviticus ultimately read citizen upcoming republican win symbolism survive beard cousin incident tribune surge america today live fair equality motivate immigration tendency capture attack refugee middle meal school area time deal plead suspect show gesture biblical synagogue culture daughter jordan report equation parallel attend tragedy state pound hare offer friendship hoist reportedly brought museum simply born flank hard forge crime learn love student fulfil happen truce expand english prohibit occasional swarm picture strongly airstrikes adl hate free connect full image walk promise slain kid sign hostage thrill kindness woman instantly feel worldwide friday antisemitism decry happy light donald challenge give small ago enter early x drew act fill longer scary mass jew recent internet beacon guilty wear country muslim crowd election tumultuous meaningful grandparent deeply fatih palestinian dubbed loss iconic reverberate pittsburgh vermont medium condolence represent police islamophobia trump order kaffiyeh cheer similar optimistic region decline joe talk arabic post photographer disagreed accord traveler office resonates indianapolis kill strip repercussion jewish spoke top unequivocally hamas email landlord reach cycle celebrate liberty break exchange worried encourages twitter murder international told glass broken turkey violate phone claimed fast photo world day speak affect ban young education life event year joke bring explain east diplomacy adin shot safety wall verse track radio united yarmulke associate thrust immediately angry lift demonstration begin wake crazy different holiday despite remember october remain endless survey experienced comfort list connection symbol league survivor compare finally rise community travel saturday make target david discriminatory opposition heart schaumburg history receive,0.923,0.0853889943074003,8.9402841744243,0.4483198562443843,0,2023-12-01
CNN,A blind mole that swims through sand has been rediscovered after nearly 100 years,2023-12-01 04:52:00,Nell Lewis,"A blind golden mole that glides through sand has been rediscovered in South Africa, 87 years after wildlife experts feared it had gone extinct.After a two-year search relying on DNA samples and a sniffer dog, a team of conservationists and geneticists from the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) and the University of Pretoria have successfully located what’s known as De Winton’s golden mole among sand dunes in the northwest of the country.The elusive species hadn’t been officially sighted since 1936, and prior to that was only ever found in the small region of Port Nolloth in the northern Cape. About the size of a mouse or hamster and with a shimmering coat that mimics the sand, they are difficult to spot at the best of times. On top of this, they live in largely inaccessible burrows, rarely leave tunnels behind them, and have acutely sensitive hearing that detects movements from above ground.To detect the species, scientists instead relied on samples of environmental DNA (eDNA) – the DNA that animals shed as they move through the environment, such as skin cells, hair or feces.“Extracting DNA from soil is not without its challenges, but we have been honing our skills and refining our techniques – even before this project – and we were fairly confident that if De Winton’s golden mole was in the environment, we would be able to detect it by finding and sequencing its DNA,” said Samantha Mynhardt, conservation geneticist with the Endangered Wildlife Trust and Stellenbosch University, in a press release.During an expedition in June 2021, the team surveyed up to 18 kilometers (11 miles) of dune habitat a day, and – using the help of a trained scent-detection dog named Jessie – collected more than 100 soil samples from sites along the northwest coast where golden mole activity was detected. From this, they determined that several species of golden mole were present in the area.The challenge was pinpointing if De Winton’s golden mole was one of them. Common species, such as Cape golden mole and Grant’s golden mole were easily identifiable, but since there was only one De Winton’s golden mole reference DNA available, the team could not confidently identify it. They had to wait for nearly a year, until a second gene sequence for the species, from a specimen housed in a Cape Town museum, became publicly available.Bingo, it was a clear match.The team was ecstatic. “Though many people doubted that De Winton’s golden mole was still out there, I had good faith that the species had not yet gone extinct,” said Cobus Theron, senior conservation manager for EWT and a member of the search team, in the press release.A paper detailing the team’s findings published this week in the Biodiversity and Conservation journal. It notes that while the sampling demonstrated that the species may be widespread along the west coast, it is in low abundance and could be threatened by habitat loss due to diamond mining in the area. Conservation action is “both critical and urgent” to protect the populations, it adds.The golden mole project was in partnership with conservation group Re:wild, as part of its Search for Lost Species program, which aims to locate species whose status is unclear. De Winton’s golden mole is the 11th of its “most-wanted lost species” rediscovered since the program launched in 2017.Christina Biggs, manager for the Search for Lost Species, said in the release that the success of the search speaks to the persistence of the EWT team: “They left no sandhill unturned and now it’s possible to protect the areas where these threatened and rare moles live.”The detection method could also bring hope for future missions around the world. “Now not only have we solved the riddle, but we have tapped into this eDNA frontier where there is a huge amount of opportunity not only for moles, but for other lost or imperiled species,” said Theron.",3881,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/world/de-winton-golden-mole-rediscovered-c2e-scn-spc-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230427164022-20230427-cte-background-2023-full-169.jpg?q=h_900,w_1600,x_0,y_0/w_1280",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,technique present kilometer rediscover challenge method movement pretoria partnership coat publish wild ecstatic extract winton northern unclear tapped left population team cape dna urgent endanger biggs detects acutely clear animal demonstrate sniffer mimic trust action reference difficult conservationist northwest dune common rarely fairly glide museum protect elusive low jessie cell group launch edna wait expert largely shimmer specimen member possible region environment imperil week specie officially blind identify expedition town mynhardt lose mouse hair widespread rare university easily skin burrow future house leave search publicly prior note abundance port move coast bring paper successfully site tunnel locate instead detect collect find pinpoint day west scientist riddle identifiable activity sample sight manager faith samantha geneticist cobus doubt conservation area soil found stellenbosch environmental biodiversity time sequence sandhill survey gene nolloth june amount opportunity status due diamond persistence mole skill africa critical journal small solve size world frontier mission threaten extinct train south detection year fear finding top success press wildlife senior mile shed determine grant available sensitive release huge hope rely hearing mining program theron habitat spot part aim live confidently unturned ewt refining detail golden loss inaccessible project hamster confident speaks sand,0.97735,0.6956969853130637,9.389110512129374,0.5163034705407586,0,2023-12-01
CNN,‘We owe it to them’: Families of Israelis killed in war find new hope through sperm extraction,2023-12-01 04:47:00,Lianne Kolirin,"As a medical social worker at Israel’s Kaplan Hospital, Prof. Shir Daphna-Tekoah is no stranger to trauma.But when she was drafted in to work on October 7, the day Hamas attacked Israeli farms, villages and a music festival, the scale of the disaster quickly became apparent.“I’ve seen dozens of people killed in accidents or shootings, but this was the hardest thing I’ve done in my life,” Daphna-Tekoah told CNN by telephone.As head of the hospital’s rape crisis center, she was called in as reports surfaced of sexual assaults. But it was soon all hands on deck as the emergency room filled up with the injured.“I saw the horror on their faces,” Daphna-Tekoah said. “I saw in their eyes that they’d seen something unbelievable.”Worse followed. “Then came the dead bodies of youngsters in their party clothes,” she said. “They were no more than 23, 24, my own children’s age.”It was Daphna-Tekoah’s responsibility to support the families saying goodbye to their murdered loved ones. Of one family, she said: “I asked if they would like to thank their child or ask for forgiveness for anything.“The mother said: ‘I’m so sorry I let you go to the party and that I didn’t protect you.’”Then, Daphna-Tekoah posed another question. “I asked ‘Would you like me to find out about sperm preservation?’”“I can’t even explain what I saw,” said Daphna-Tekoah, who knew little about the process other than the need to act fast.“Before, there was only agony and darkness in the mother’s eyes and suddenly there was a flicker of light and hope.”Daphna-Tekoah immediately approached hospital management, and just a few hours later they had the legal sign-off needed. By the following morning, the sperm of several victims from the Nova festival had been retrieved.Now, more than seven weeks later, Israeli hospitals have been inundated with requests to cryogenically freeze the sperm of those killed in the conflict, hospital officials say.Posthumous sperm retrieval (PSR) was previously open to partners - provided other relatives did not object - but parents of the deceased had to apply for legal permission.But the Ministry of Health has recently slashed the red tape. In a statement on its website, it says hospitals have been instructed, during the war, to approve requests for PSR “from the deceased’s parents, without referring them to a family court.”Sperm lives on briefly after death, which is why it’s possible for doctors - usually a fertility or urology specialist - to retrieve it from testicular tissue. Any live sperm cells found are transferred and frozen in liquid nitrogen.Dr. Noga Fuchs Weizman, medical director of the sperm bank and male infertility unit at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, said there have been many requests from bereaved families.“The demand has been very high,” she told CNN in a video call, adding that dozens of families have accessed the service since October 7.According to Dr. Shimi Barda, laboratory director of the unit, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) offer families the option when informing them of their loss. “They proactively suggest it,” he said.Soon after the October 7 attacks, the case of Israeli singer Shaylee Atary, whose husband was killed trying to protect their baby in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, made headlines.According to Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Atary “did everything in her power to retrieve his sperm,” in the hope of expanding their family in the future. She was unsuccessful, but her experience raised awareness.The retrieval initiative is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which then splits cases between four hospitals.Detecting live sperm is most likely in the first 24 hours after death, so timing is crucial, said Barda.“We’ve limited the timeframe to 72 hours; however, the literature and our own experience suggests 44 to 45 hours is the maximum.”The manner of death is also important.“It depends on the state of the body, how it was kept and how severe the injuries were,” said Barda.The hospital speaks directly to families, said Fuchs Weizman. “We tell them what we managed to freeze… and briefly about the process later, if they choose to use it.”Barda added: “It’s very emotional, very hard, but we give them some hope.”Irit Oren Gunders is the founder of Or Lamishpachot (Light to the Families), a non-profit organization supporting families of fallen soldiers. She has long campaigned for parents to have access to PSR.“We need to give them hope and open their hearts again and only grandchildren will do it. It isn’t that they want a baby instead of their son - it’s the grandchild,” she told CNN by telephone.Irit Rosenblum, a pioneering lawyer and founder of New Family, which advocates for family rights, is also working with bereaved parents.Rosenblum made legal history in 2007 with the case of a woman whose son was killed in Gaza. This client became the first parent in Israel and one of the first in the world to win the right to have her son’s sperm extracted, she said. But it took over a decade for her to become a grandmother.PSR can be the easy part, Rosenblum told CNN. “It’s a long process,” she said in a telephone interview. “We’ve had approximately 40 requests for extraction recently and it was easy to allow them but the next step will be finding women to use the sperm.”Rosenblum says she has been instrumental in the birth of more than 100 children. She has long campaigned for biological wills, which provide unequivocal guidance after death. Since the Hamas attacks, she has made it quick and easy to complete a biological will online.“I’m not a religious person but Israeli society is very family oriented and continuity is a must,” she said.“The mourner has lost the will to live - the only way to restore meaning to their lives is through the continuity of the person they lost. Not allowing it, even though we have the technology, is not moral.”Yulia and Vlad Poznianski, whose son Baruch died of cancer aged 25, are among those helped by Rosenblum.Fifteen years on, Yulia still finds it difficult to talk about Baruch’s death. Instead, she focuses on the future and her granddaughter, Shira, who’s just turned 8.“We made new life,” said Yulia, of their collaboration with Liat Malka, a single woman who had Shira using their son’s sperm.“We’re very grateful to her but she’s also grateful to us,” said Yulia of Malka, explaining that they are very active grandparents.Yulia describes Shira as a “brilliant” child whose resemblance to her father is “unbelievable.”“She’s a big girl and she understands. She’s not the first and won’t be the last child whose father isn’t alive - especially now,” said Yulia.Soldiers sent into conflict must be told about their options, said Yulia. “They have to know that they can leave their parents or wife their biological will.”Gil Siegal, head of the Center for Health Law and Bioethics at Kiryat Ono College in Israel and faculty at the University of Virginia Law School, told CNN by telephone: “It’s not by accident that Israel is a pioneer in reproductive medicine.“The combination of high-tech medicine and a strong cultural, religious and existentialist bent for reproduction results in the highest number of IVF clinics per capita and the highest number of IVF cycles for women in the world.”He said traditional ethical perspectives have been upended by the loss of life - especially among the young - since October 7.“This is a new twist and Israel is pushing the envelope here,” he said. “We have the science and know-how on the one hand and on the second hand we have the impetus, which is religion, culture and history.”Nevertheless, ethical questions must be considered, he said.“When you face such a horrendous loss you do anything that is some sort of panacea for your endless grief and pain - but this is not the way we make policy.”He believes bereaved parents should be allowed to access PSR, “but then you halt.”With “zero urgency,” he said, “we have time to sit and debate and think about the implications of planned orphanhood, motivated by the request of the deceased’s parents.”He added: “Planned orphanhood in the sense that this child was born out of a tragedy as a living memorial of the deceased soldier.”But for Daphna-Tekoah, the answer is clear in the wake of the Hamas attack.“If, as a country, we encourage people to donate organs after death, why aren’t we giving people the right to donate sperm? We’re not living in the Middle Ages and the technology is here.

CNN,Kiwi birds born in New Zealand’s capital for first time in over a century,2023-12-01 03:43:00,Tara Subramaniam,"Conservationists have discovered two kiwi chicks in Wellington, the first wild births recorded for the bird in the New Zealand capital in over 150 years.The two new chicks come just a year after the Capital Kiwi Project reintroduced the country’s iconic national bird to the city of around 400,000 people.Their birth in Makara, a suburb just 25 minutes from Wellington’s city center, takes the local total to 65 North Island brown kiwi.The brown kiwi is one of New Zealand’s most common kiwi species, but according to New Zealand’s Department of Conservation, the birds could be extinct in the wild within two generations without adequate conservation and support.Another 18 brown kiwi chicks are expected to hatch as part of the Capital Kiwi Project, which hopes to restore a large-scale wild population of kiwi to New Zealand’s capital. The project plans to use transmitters to monitor the two new kiwi chicks as well as any others that hatch.The flightless birds, which once numbered around 12 million in New Zealand, have seen their population plummet to just 68,000, according to the Save the Kiwi charity. The charity is among approximately 90 Kiwi conservation programs aiming to boost the population.In 1991, the New Zealand Department of Conservation launched the Kiwi Recovery Plan, which focused on predator control and community engagement.According to New Zealand’s Department of Conservation, the country’s kiwi population is declining at an average of 2% a year, mostly due to predators like stoats, cats, dogs and ferrets.95% of wild born kiwi in New Zealand are killed before they reach adulthood, according to Save the Kiwi.“Really the only issue for an adult kiwi is roaming dogs. Where they get hammered is stoats eating the chicks before they get up to their fighting weight,” Capital Kiwi Project team leader Paul Ward told CNN earlier this year.Ward expressed optimism about the project, after the release of the 63 kiwi near Wellington last November which marked the first time in about a century that wild kiwi have lived in the area.",2059,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/world/kiwi-born-new-zealand-capital-first-time-century-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230427164022-20230427-cte-background-2023-full-169.jpg?q=h_900,w_1600,x_0,y_0/w_1280",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,average reach kill approximately marked country local wild plummet optimism expect recovery told transmitter population community team reintroduce born decline hatch monitor conservation area makara time conservationist common due century brown cnn fight accord numbered launch charity wellington extinct issue save year total adult control capital suburb specie zealand adequate iconic plan adulthood kiwi national release record discover island hope weight flightless north center program ward boost chick predator birth leader part aim roam hammer live city stoat department earlier bird minute focus generation express eat project restore paul million november,0.9296,0.8742107819329771,10.861170212765956,0.4145167895167896,0,2023-12-01
CNN,Iranian dissident rapper Toomaj Salehi rearrested less than two weeks after release from prison,2023-11-30 23:04:00,Artemis Moshtaghian,"Iranian dissident rapper Toomaj Salehi was rearrested in northern Iran on Thursday, less than two weeks after his release from prison, according to his official social media channel.The rapper had previously been detained for more than a year and held in solitary confinement for most of that time, on charges related to supporting the widespread protest movement in Iran last year.Local sources and witnesses said that Salehi and his acquaintances were violently arrested while walking down a street in the city of Babol on Thursday. A group of armed men suddenly approached Salehi and his friends and, without identifying themselves, started attacking the group, witnesses said.The plain-clothed men repeatedly struck the rapper with the ends of their rifles before blindfolding him and taking him into custody, they added.Salehi, 32, had expressed support online and in his songs for protests triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman who died after being detained by the “morality police” and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not wearing her hijab properly.When nationwide protests started in mid-September last year, Salehi called for Iranians to protest against the government.Salehi, who is of Bakhtiari ethnic background, has long rapped about Iran’s multi-ethnic makeup, encouraging unity among Iranians of different backgrounds.After his arrest in October 2022 at the height of the protests, he was sentenced to six years and three months in prison. But he was released on bail from a prison in Isfahan on November 18, after his attorney filed a successful appeal with Isfahan’s Revolutionary Court, according to Iran’s pro-reform news outlet Shargh Daily.Shargh reported the attorney had filed a complaint citing Salehi’s treatment in detention, saying that authorities were not providing proper medical care for his client’s broken leg.The supreme court also took into consideration the general amnesty order announced by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in February when granting the appeal for Salehi’s case.Salehi recently recorded a video in which he detailed his treatment in prison.“I was tortured a lot during my detention,” Salehi says in the video, posted on social media. He described how he was repeatedly struck in the head and face, and claimed his fingers were broken as he tried to protect his face from blows.“It’s not a pleasant thing to explain, but it continued for a long time,” he says.The Iranian judiciary news agency Mizan said Thursday Salehi was arrested for making false claims publicly on social media without supporting documentation, and on charges of spreading lies and disturbing public opinion.Sources close to Salehi told CNN the rapper had recently started treatment and therapy for the injuries he sustained while in prison and was scheduled to undergo surgery in the coming days.",2881,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/middleeast/iranian-rapper-toomaj-salehi-arrested-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/221106072942-01-toomaj-salehi.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lie make struck song file encourage thursday court injury movement makeup arrest dissident agency day amini northern told official february shargh charge claimed salehi client approach attack violently authority consideration ethnic police documentation therapy hijab announce repeatedly nationwide news wear time sentence broken order morality amnesty previously revolutionary detailed recently street related head ayatollah continued cnn surgery prison social friend protect outlet accord solitary allegedly death supreme complaint group report blindfolding treatment woman rapper different iran call walk schedule year mizan long week iranian lot babol general protest disturb detain background khamenei identify confinement grant successful public release record kurdish medical detention witness height rifle proper acquaintance center unity attorney judiciary arm toomaj close rearrested suddenly mahsa pleasant medium bail leader false widespread city finger provide described november support claim post sustain publicly online rapped explain video spread held appeal express isfahan bakhtiari month october torture start custody trigger undergo source,-0.95205,0.0,12.530379241516965,0.3453968253968253,0,2023-11-30

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also invited to attend. Israel planned to send a large delegation of about 1,000 people, an official previously said.However, the delegation would now be smaller, the official said, citing that some of those who were to take part in the delegation had been called up for reserve military duty.The UAE is one of few Arab states that has official diplomatic ties with Israel.

Reuters,US deports ex-coup leader to crisis-torn Haiti,2023-11-30 19:59:00,not specified,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday deported former Haitian coup leader Guy Philippe back to his Caribbean homeland after serving some six years in a U.S. prison on charges of money-laundering linked to Colombian drug trafficking.Philippe, a former police officer who led the 2004 ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and later won a senatorial race in the rural Grand'Anse region, is currently in a police facility near the capital's main airport, a police source told Reuters.It was not immediately clear whether Philippe will continue to be detained.Local outlet Haiti9 News published footage showing a handful pro-Philippe protesters outside the airport.Philippe was arrested and handed over to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration shortly before swearing in as senator in 2017. A Miami judge sentenced him to nine years in prison, but he was released early in September.Philippe initially pleaded not guilty, saying he was ""kidnapped"" by the United States for his political beliefs. He later changed his plea in a deal that prevented him from facing a longer U.S. sentence.In a statement late last year arguing for his early release, Philippe said he was ""looking forward to returning to Haiti and participate in the betterment of his community"" in Pestel, on the country's southern peninsula.Four years after Philippe's arrest, President Jovenel Moise was killed in his home, creating a political vacuum that allowed the rise of extremely violent armed gangs, which now control large parts of the country fueling a dire humanitarian crisis.",1585,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-deports-ex-coup-leader-crisis-torn-haiti-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,news jovenel leader longer kidnap vacuum arm judge region source nov administration capital race footage guy united caribbean currently rise forward country year airport fuel clear back pestel state deal belief large haitian president part betterment sentence initially early extremely dire protester political change handful late statement told shortly serve aristide police deport violent miami coup charge plead link guilty home humanitarian colombian officer former prison hand continue philippe argue community publish lead release show gang return kill homeland facility southern arrest control ouster prevent rural haiti moise thursday swear crisis senator create reuters plea enforcement senatorial outlet immediately participate,-0.9661,0.3785488958990536,13.24802973977695,0.2504409171075837,0,2023-11-30
Reuters,Embattled Representative George Santos says expulsion attempt is 'bullying',2023-11-30 19:49:00,"Makini Brice, Andy Sullivan","WASHINGTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Indicted U.S. Representative George Santos on Thursday struck a defiant note ahead of an expected vote to expel him from Congress and lashed out at other lawmakers in what could be his final days on Capitol Hill.""This is bullying,"" Santos said at a news conference outside the Capitol. ""It's all theater.""The 35-year-old first-term congressman faces criminal campaign-finance charges and has admitted to fabricating much of his biography. His fellow Republicans have scheduled a vote on his expulsion on Friday.Santos survived one expulsion vote earlier this month, but faces longer odds this time. A bipartisan congressional probe released after the vote found evidence that he spent campaign money on Botox, luxury brands such as Hermes and on OnlyFans, an online platform known for sexual content.That has prompted some of the Republicans who previously voted against removing him to withdraw their support.Santos declined to comment on that report, but said he was not wearing anything purchased with campaign funds.""These are six years old,"" he said, pointing at his shoes.Later in the day, he filed a motion to force an expulsion vote against Democratic Representative Jamaal Bowman, who pleaded guilty in October to a misdemeanor charge of setting off a fire alarm before a vote. That is unlikely to succeed as it would need substantial Democratic support.""This is just another meaningless stunt in his long history of cons, antics, and outright fraud,"" Bowman said in a statement.Santos has said he will not run for reelection next year but has remained bellicose in the face of growing pressure that he step down. The drumbeat of scandal has left him isolated in Congress, where he sits on no committees and has little influence.[1/4]U.S. Rep.

His district, which includes parts of New York City and its Long Island suburbs, is seen as competitive.An election to fill his seat would be held within three months, according to New York state law.At least 77 Republicans will have to vote for expulsion, along with the chamber's 213 Democrats, to meet the two-thirds majority required under the U.S. Constitution.Santos would be only the sixth member to be expelled from the House of Representatives, and the first who has not been convicted of a crime or fought for the Confederacy during the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War.Santos' troubles began shortly after his November 2022 election, when media outlets reported that he had not actually attended New York University and worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, as he had claimed during the campaign.He also falsely claimed Jewish heritage and told voters his grandparents had fled the Nazis during World War Two.That made Santos a pariah in the House and the butt of television comedians even before federal prosecutors charged him with an array of fraud and campaign-finance crimes.In a 23-count indictment, they accuse him of inflating his fundraising totals in order to draw more support from the Republican Party, laundering funds to pay for personal expenses, and charging donors' credits cards without permission.Two former campaign aides have pleaded guilty to related fraud charges.Santos denies wrongdoing, and his trial is scheduled for Sept. 9, 2024, shortly before the November elections that will determine control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.Reporting by Makini Brice and Andy Sullivan; additional reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Scott Malone, Nick Zieminski and Jonathan OatisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",4031,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/embattled-rep-george-santos-says-expulsion-attempt-is-bullying-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point news run narrow hill misdemeanor press fill withdraw draw indict nick final makini make brand grandparent year oatisour trouble medium principle seat part island order bowman include fundraise wish frantz platform sachs credit sullivan acquire brice history capitol evidence prompt motion aide sixth goldman remain fabricate time scandal election bellicose odds george edit defiant admit wrongdoing outright democratic trust prosecutor lash alarm rightssantos long accord suburb hermes address sexual thomson city personal release previously claimed expense inflate card report november meet voter butt additional onlyfans purchase proud scott october isolated indictment probe antic set falsely succeed confederacy spent thursday pay found congress fire accuse luxury fought democrat note jewish majority outlet substantial record chamber university bipartisan conference money month longer predict sits left drumbeat expect stunt nov criminal schedule nazi pressure republican meaningless zieminski party attend ahead fellow reporting jonathan bullying force state crime andy require effort civil campaign comment york begin determine washington heritage related work convict licensing step wear house denies theater santos told standard shortly survive friday vote hold file online donor charge plead guilty reelection flee remove former committee district citigroup total world botox jamaal decline member fraud pariah representative expel array susan heavey struck slim grow control earlier held white laundering expulsion trial congressional television lawmaker congressman comedian federal day reuters support biography fund,-0.98035,0.0,11.348365650969528,0.4223455485083393,0,2023-11-30
Reuters,"Henry Kissinger, dominant US diplomat of Cold War era, dies aged 100",2023-11-30 19:46:00,"Steve Holland, Arshad Mohammed","WASHINGTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Henry Kissinger, the most powerful U.S. diplomat of the Cold War era, who helped Washington open up to China, forge arms control deals with the Soviet Union and end the Vietnam War, but who was reviled by critics over human rights, has died aged 100.Kissinger, a German-born Jewish refugee whose career took him from academia to diplomacy and who remained an active voice in foreign policy into his later years, died at his home in Connecticut on Wednesday, his geopolitical consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, said.A memorial service will take place in New York, and Kissinger will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington, said a source familiar with the arrangements.Kissinger was at the height of his powers during the 1970s in the middle of the Cold War when he served as national security adviser and secretary of state under Republican President Richard Nixon.After Nixon's resignation in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal, he remained a diplomatic force as secretary of state under Nixon's successor, President Gerald Ford.Kissinger was the architect of the U.S. diplomatic opening with China, landmark U.S.-Soviet arms control talks, expanded ties between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and the Paris Peace Accords with North Vietnam.While many hailed Kissinger for his brilliance and statesmanship, others branded him a war criminal for his support for anti-communist dictatorships, especially in Latin America. In his latter years, his travels were circumscribed by efforts by some countries to arrest or question him about past U.S. foreign policy.Democratic President Joe Biden's White House called Kissinger's death ""a huge loss"" and noted his World War Two military service and years of public service afterward.Added, national security spokesman John Kirby, ""Whether you saw eye-to-eye with him on every issue, there’s no question that he shaped foreign policy decisions for decades, and he certainly had an impact on America’s role in the world.""There was no immediate comment from Biden himself.Kissinger won the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for ending U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, but it was one of the most controversial ever. Two Nobel committee members resigned over the selection as questions arose about the secret U.S. bombing of Cambodia. North Vietnamese diplomat Le Duc Tho, selected to share the award, declined it.As tributes poured in from around the world, Beijing called him a ""good old friend of the Chinese people"" who made historic contributions to normalizing relations between the two countries.Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Kissinger as a ""wise and farsighted statesman"" while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his meetings with Kissinger provided ""a master class in statesmanship.""Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdul Momen, however, recalled Kissinger's role in the bloody 1971 war between West and East Pakistan that led eventually to East Pakistan becoming an independent Bangladesh.""Henry Kissinger has been an iconic diplomat ... but unfortunately, in 1971, he was dead against the people of the then-East Pakistan,"" Momen told WION news. ""That is very sad for such a smart man to do such inhumane things. ... He should have apologized to the people of Bangladesh for what he has done.""With his distinctive German-accented voice, Kissinger was never shy to offer his opinion. Ford called him a ""super secretary of state"" but also noted his prickliness and self-assurance, saying, ""Henry in his mind never made a mistake.""""He had the thinnest skin of any public figure I ever knew,"" Ford told an interviewer shortly before his death in 2006.Current U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""few people were better students of history – and even fewer people did more to shape history – than Henry Kissinger,"" while Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called him a ""rare scholar turned strategist.""Heinz Alfred Kissinger was born in Fuerth, Germany, on May 27, 1923, and moved to the United States with his family in 1938 before the Nazi campaign to exterminate European Jewry.[1/5]Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger arrives for a memorial service for late Social Democratic senior politician Egon Bahr at St. Mary's Church in Berlin, Germany, September 17, 2015.

He used his connections with President Lyndon Johnson's Democratic administration to pass on information about peace negotiations to the Nixon camp.When Nixon's pledge to end the Vietnam War helped him win the 1968 presidential election, he brought in Kissinger as national security adviser.But the process of ""Vietnamization"" - shifting the burden of the war from U.S. forces to the South Vietnamese - was long and bloody, punctuated by massive U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, the mining of the North's harbors, and the bombing of Cambodia.Kissinger declared in 1972 that ""peace is at hand"" in Vietnam, but the Paris Peace Accords signed in January 1973 were little more than a prelude to the final Communist takeover of the South two years later.In 1973, in addition to his role as national security adviser, Kissinger was named secretary of state - giving him unchallenged authority in foreign affairs.An intensifying Arab-Israeli conflict launched Kissinger on his first ""shuttle"" mission, a brand of highly personal, high-pressure diplomacy for which he became famous.Thirty-two days of shuttling between Jerusalem and Damascus helped Kissinger forge a long-lasting disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.In an effort to diminish Soviet influence, Kissinger reached out to its chief communist rival, China, and made two trips there, including a secret one to meet with Premier Zhou Enlai. The result was Nixon's historic 1972 summit in Beijing with Chairman Mao Zedong and the eventual formalization of relations between the two countries.Former U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord, who served as Kissinger's special assistant, called his former boss a ""tireless advocate for peace,"" saying, ""America has lost a towering champion for the national interest.""As secretary of state, Kissinger went with Ford in 1974 to Vladivostok in the Soviet Union, where the president met Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and agreed to a basic framework for a strategic arms pact. The agreement capped Kissinger's pioneering efforts at detente that led to an easing of U.S.-Soviet tensions.But Kissinger's diplomatic skills had their limits. In 1975, he was blamed for failing to persuade Israel and Egypt to agree to a second-stage disengagement in the Sinai.And in the India-Pakistan War of 1971, Nixon and Kissinger drew heavy criticism for tilting toward Pakistan. Kissinger was heard calling the Indians ""bastards"" - a remark he later said he regretted.Like Nixon, he feared the spread of left-wing ideas in the Western Hemisphere, and his actions in response led to deep distrust of Washington by many Latin Americans for years to come.In 1970, he plotted with the CIA on how best to topple the Marxist, democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende, and in a memo after Argentina's coup in 1976 he said that the military dictators should be encouraged.When Ford lost to Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, in 1976, Kissinger's days in government were largely over. The next Republican in the White House, Ronald Reagan, distanced himself from Kissinger, viewing him as out of step with his conservative constituency.After leaving government, Kissinger set up a high-priced, high-powered consulting firm in New York, which offered advice to the world's corporate elite. He served on company boards and various foreign policy and security forums, wrote books, and became a regular media commentator on international affairs.After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, President George W. Bush picked Kissinger to head an investigative committee. But outcry from Democrats who saw a conflict of interest with many of his consulting firm's clients forced Kissinger to step down.",8509,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/henry-kissinger-dominant-us-diplomat-cold-war-era-dies-aged-100-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,involvement news leader company international antony rival leave arrives spread harbor social skill henry union loss bangladesh peace south blinken lloyd advice reagan deal result medium john master assistant dead turn active consultant conflict leonid north prelude student government burden expand late influence tilt history ambassador pledge mao familiar serve shape huge drew remain time distinctive normalize cemetery george citizen netanyahu democratic rare long hand provide security mission mind declare prickliness call addition agency move diminish investigative meet associate lose tie forum china picked capped issue unchallenged trip putin arose mining attack jewry refugee cold forge brilliance question mistake note write wednesday opening university vietnamization alfred doctorate selection european interviewer secretary east memorial foreign arm criminal immediate vladivostok interest champion award heinz republican brought controversial contribution wise policy vietnam west adviser skin indian book effort campaign york comment biden arlington soviet chilean intensify sad critic duc scholar house allende austin academia travel told carter syria bush vietnamese largely give coup minister bastard distrust remark regular former golan punctuate prime statesman naturalize fail praise communist plot cia special january massive head ease beijing damascus decade thinnest apologize career architect control ford white neighbor stayed basic egon chief strategic september formalization historic response jimmy support intermediary enlai information america wion inhumane opinion source marxist administration revile united resign final american role chinese make brand sign year exterminate israel brezhnev voice military act politician geopolitical fear agreement include spokesman firm power acquire kirby johnson latin europe bangladeshi nobel circumscribed amid western landmark faculty distance momen detente zhou election jerusalem scandal commentator especially nixon pioneer home hail pakistan bahr prize diplomat accord rightsanglicizing family disengagement resignation pact shy personal share middle impact israeli secret richard client conservative successor heard highly past cambodia service knew fuerth hemisphere arrest decision shuttle gerald independent set bombing abdul select winston meeting shift idea benjamin height talk framework deep photo democrat action view open jewish paris win harvard diplomacy salvador bloody lyndon class egypt heavy nov elect negotiation nazi army berlin smart lord limit board outcry kissinger joe persuade chairman attend connection earn launch country summit force eventually state iconic place advocate statesmanship president takeover memo bos washington offer national age licensing step figure democratically powerful corporate shortly born recall agree tower scholarship death relation friend reach eventual committee strategist topple criticism ronald zedong world argentina bury diplomatic latter public lead authority connecticut decline watergate member farsighted defense germany tireless dictator arab senior unfortunately church consult department vladimir process human mary day reuters elite premier dictatorship tribute blame presidential super,0.01385,0.5641085909037489,11.861405835543763,0.3932570264202916,0,2023-11-30
Reuters,Britain refers Abu Dhabi-backed Telegraph deal to regulators,2023-11-30 18:31:00,not specified,"LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Britain's media minister said on Thursday she would intervene in the acquisition of the Telegraph Media Group by Abu Dhabi-backed RedBird IMI on public interest grounds over concerns about the accurate presentation of news or free expression of opinion.The right-leaning Daily Telegraph broadsheet and Spectator magazine, favourites of politicians in the ruling Conservative Party, are being sold after Lloyds Banking Group in June seized control following a long-running dispute with owners, the Barclay family.The Barclays have teamed up with RedBird IMI, which is led by former CNN executive Jeff Zucker, in a bid to repay a 1.2 billion pound ($1.5 billion) debt. The plan would hand control of the titles to RedBird IMI through a debt-for-equity swap.IMI (International Media Investments) is backed by Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi and the owner of Manchester City soccer club.The sale had been paused until a court hearing scheduled for Dec. 4 to give the consortium time to repay the debt.Last week, the British government told RedBird IMI in a letter that media minister Lucy Frazer was concerned about its potential to influence the Telegraph's operations.On Thursday, Frazer said: ""My department has today written to the Barclay family and RedBird IMI, the current and proposed owners of Telegraph Media Group, to inform them that I will be issuing a Public Interest Intervention Notice.""Frazer added that as a result, Britain's Competition Markets Authority (CMA) and media regulator Ofcom would examine the deal, looking at ""the need for accurate presentation of news and free expression of opinion in newspapers"".""I have asked both the CMA and Ofcom to report back to me by 26 January 2024,"" Frazer said.RedBird IMI said last week it would be ""fully committed to maintaining the existing editorial team of the publications"" if it gained ownership, and it believed that editorial independence was essential to protect the titles' reputation and credibility.",2037,https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-formally-intervenes-abu-dhabi-backed-telegraph-deal-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,news international ofcom billion opinion presentation nov schedule britain accurate interest publication independence pound dispute party concerned believe lloyd ownership back politician deal medium soccer result notice daily magazine protect favourite june potential banking ground examine add government influence british reputation told debt barclays team repay time give competition nahyan maintain manchester minister bid letter london seize propose today abu mansour former plan cnn exist spectator hand zucker consortium family court investment fully executive public city expression lead authority newspaper zayed cma january inform member report telegraph hearing redbird follow sell current conservative commit pause essential control week issue concern jeff group frazer department ruling title thursday regulator owner free barclay dhabi lucy reuters broadsheet editorial write intervene intervention acquisition credibility market,0.9337,0.0,11.64854794520548,0.3041666666666666,0,2023-11-30
Reuters,Senate Democrats authorize US Supreme Court ethics subpoenas,2023-11-30 18:09:00,"John Kruzel, Andrew Chung","WASHINGTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A Democratic-led U.S. Senate panel said on Thursday it has authorized subpoenas to two influential conservatives - Harlan Crow and Leonard Leo - as part of an ethics inquiry spurred by reports of undisclosed largesse directed to some conservative Supreme Court justices.The Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to authorize the subpoenas for Crow, a billionaire Republican donor and benefactor of conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, and Leo, a legal activist who was instrumental in compiling Republican former President Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees.Senator Dick Durbin, the committee's chairman, renewed his criticism of a new code of conduct announced by the court on Nov. 13 and promised to continue to pursue the panel's ethics investigation.""Without an enforcement mechanism, this code of conduct, while a step in a positive direction, cannot restore the public's faith in the court,"" Durbin said.Senator Lindsey Graham, the committee's top Republican, told the hearing that Democrats were engaged in a ""jihad"" against the Supreme Court, whose 6-3 conservative majority has handed major defeats to liberals in recent years on matters including abortion, gun rights and student debt relief.""When you say you don't want to destroy the Roberts Court, I don't believe you,"" Graham said, referring to the court under the leadership of conservative Chief Justice John Roberts. ""I don't believe a word you're saying.""The committee authorized Durbin to issue the subpoenas, which he could do unilaterally, according to a Democratic committee staffer.If the subpoena recipients fail to comply, Democrats would need 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to initiate a civil enforcement action, meaning they would need the support of some Republicans. The Democrats also would have the option to make a referral to the U.S. Justice Department, which could choose to pursue criminal contempt proceedings against the subpoena recipients.Durbin has said subpoenas were necessary in light of the refusal by Crow and Leo to voluntarily comply with the panel's previous requests for information, including itemized lists of all gifts, transportation and lodging provided to any Supreme Court justice.Lawyers for Leo and Crow in letters to the committee have criticized the committee's information requests as lacking a proper legal justification. Crow's lawyer had proposed turning over a narrower range of information but Democrats rebuffed that offer, according to the panel's Democratic members.The news outlet ProPublica reported this year on Thomas's failure to disclose luxury trips and real estate transactions involving Crow, a Texas businessman.The outlet also reported that Leo helped organize a luxury fishing trip in Alaska attended by conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who failed to disclose taking a private jet provided by billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer. Trump chose all three of his appointees to the court from lists of candidates that Leo played a key role in drawing up, giving it a 6-3 conservative majority.",3090,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-expected-vote-supreme-court-ethics-subpoenas-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,liberal news ethic billionaire lack organize information unilaterally manager nov disclose criminal played draw thomas jihad announce referral instrumental republican robert faith harlan graham restore party chairman role believe make attend real gift dick year subpoena option authorize matter range fishing mechanism private civil john panel president part inquiry turn narrower include washington offer abortion justification potential singer step initiate fund supreme justice student candidate investigation request choose told debt rebuffed failure undisclosed promise conduct vote crow gun donor give relief pursue letter propose trump transportation former refusal largesse committee democratic itemize paul refer fail criticism hand accord involve continue compile provide lawyer samuel list recipient court word senate appointee lindsey major comply public positive light hedge meaning chose report leo spur renew code hearing previous direct proper transaction jet conservative criticize donald clarence influential voluntarily legal issue line trip leadership benefactor engage chief direction estate alaska defeat department recent key judiciary proceeding durbin activist thursday destroy propublica luxury contempt democrat action reuters support enforcement leonard top majority outlet texas alito lodge,0.76895,0.0,12.769606003752347,0.4003472222222222,0,2023-11-30
Reuters,Treasury's Yellen tours lithium plant to bolster Biden's economic case,2023-11-30 17:59:00,"Howard Schneider, David Lawder","BESSEMER CITY, North Carolina Nov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen traveled to North Carolina on Thursday to tout hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy investments enabled by federal tax incentives as President Joe Biden struggles to win credit among voters for his economic record.Yellen toured a Livent (LTHM.N) facility in Bessemer City, North Carolina, that processes lithium hydroxide, a key ingredient in electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The plant near Charlotte is doubling its capacity due to increased demand for EVs spurred by consumer tax credits of up to $7,500 in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), adding cutting edge technology to an area hard hit when legacy industries like textiles left for other countries.Yellen, who spoke in front of one-ton bags of lithium hydroxide at a Livent warehouse, said the ""battery belt"" arising across the U.S. Midwest and South showed the administration's strategy is working and contributing to current low rates of unemployment and ongoing economic growth.""Scaling up our domestic manufacturing capacity - particularly in new industries - can help create well-paying, middle-class jobs for Americans across the country, serving people and places that have too often been left behind,"" Yellen said.""GDP growth and the labor market are strong and inflation is now down substantially from its peak ... That strength isn't just apparent in aggregate statistics. It reflects contributions from consumers consuming more and businesses investing more, as our economy's overall strength is translating to higher real household incomes.""Yellen said investments similar to those made by Livent were taking place across the country, with $614 billion worth of clean energy investments and manufacturing projects announced since the Biden administration took office in 2021. These include $142 billion in EVs and batteries and $71 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and she attributed much of the investment to tax credits in the IRA.It's a development that will bolster U.S. energy security and reduce American dependence on China's EV battery supply chain, said Yellen, who was joined on her tour by North Carolina's Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, highlighting the state's importance in next year's presidential election.During the tour, Yellen visited a control room, where she started one of the plant's machines, a bagging area where lithium hydroxide is packed for storing, and a research and development facility - at one point commenting ""that's amazing"" as workers explained their latest lithium project.The Biden administration in coming days is expected to release new guidance on the levels of Chinese content that EV batteries can have and still qualify for IRA tax credits. The Livent plant processes lithium brine largely from Argentina and Canada.Yellen said the bulk of investments spurred by the legislation was flowing to counties with below-average college graduation rates, providing good jobs ""where they are most needed.""Increased investment in new manufacturing projects, machinery and warehouses, which also include new semiconductor plants, helped the U.S. economy to grow at a torrid 5.2% annual pace in the third quarter, defying predictions earlier this year that it was headed for a recession.But Biden has struggled to win voter confidence in his handling of the economy, with polls earlier this month showing Republican front-runner Donald Trump ahead in five of the six most important battleground states.Voters remain deeply scarred by the higher living costs brought about by post-pandemic inflation, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. It will take time for this to fade and for people to feel the benefits of higher wages, he added.""People are hearing that things are getting much better, inflation is coming down and we're not coming into a recession,"" Sabato said. ""But in their lives every week, when they go to the gas station or into the grocery store, they still perceive higher prices, and their minds are oriented to bad news. And people are going to blame the president.""",4141,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/yellen-tours-north-carolina-lithium-plant-bolster-bidens-case-us-economy-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point news strategy defy livent ingredient larry contribute project double growth administration technology bolster announce south demand american manufacturing politics worker ongoing chinese handle machinery make center recession real important year poll level act feel industry income consume arise packed include reduce economy lithium electric north credit rate development late spoke strength hit serve midwest remain quarter time economic due edge tax democratic battery consumer warehouse highlight start reflect roy provide security mind reduction unemployment city hydroxide charlotte invest release hearing janet voter current bulk amaze bessemer donald machine battleground vehicle facility china bagging labor particularly carolina energy gas perceive substantially thursday cooper fade governor office apparent price statistic market peak domestic university scar worth sabato month legislation belt win station secretary billion left scale gdp cut expect high nov republican brought cost joe importance contribution aggregate confidence ahead pace country household inflation similar translate prediction state hard qualify place brine comment biden president ira strong legacy front struggle work graduation grocery life add job virginia orient yellen director travel research living attribute tout annual treasury largely business wage flow tour trump room plant capacity argentina clean investment visit deeply low show head dependence store torrid benefit spur county grow control guidance earlier week enable join explain content key college bag area textile process federal supply increase day create reuters hundred ev chain semiconductor incentive dollar blame presidential,0.97615,0.0724462690171456,11.95551299589603,0.4243963873428159,0,2023-11-30
CNN,"Mary Cleave, the first woman to fly on NASA’s space shuttle after Challenger disaster, dies at 76",2023-11-30 15:07:00,Jackie Wattles,"Mary Cleave, the NASA astronaut who in 1989 became the first woman to fly on a space shuttle mission after the Challenger disaster, has died at the age of 76, the space agency announced on Wednesday.NASA did not give a cause of death.“I’m sad we’ve lost trail blazer Dr. Mary Cleave, shuttle astronaut, veteran of two spaceflights, and first woman to lead the Science Mission Directorate as associate administrator,” said NASA Associate Administrator Bob Cabana in a statement. “Mary was a force of nature with a passion for science, exploration, and caring for our home planet. She will be missed.”Cleave — who died Monday, according to the statement — was a native of Great Neck, New York. She studied biological sciences at Colorado State University before going on to earn her master’s in microbial ecology and a doctorate in civil and environmental engineering from Utah State University.She told NASA’s Oral History Project in 2002 that she was enamored with flying airplanes growing up, and she earned her pilot’s license before her driver’s license. At one point, Cleave said, she had wanted to be a flight attendant, but found that at 5-foot-2, she was too short for the role under airline rules at the time.Cleave noted that affirmative action helped pave the way for her passions, allowing her the opportunity to fly supersonic jets known as T-38s.“For me, space flight was great, but it was gravy on top of getting to fly in great airplanes,” she told NASA.Cleave said she had been working at a research lab and finishing her doctoral studies in Utah when she saw an ad at a local post office stating that NASA was searching for scientists to join the astronaut corps. She applied and was selected in 1980.On her first mission, flying on NASA’s Space Shuttle Atlantis in 1985, Cleave became the 10th woman to travel into space. On the mission, she served as a flight engineer and helped operate the shuttle’s robotic arm.“It seemed like they assigned women to fly the arm (Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) or Canadarm) more often than guys, and the rumor on the street was because they thought women did that better,” Cleave said in her 2002 NASA interview, noting that she never confirmed the rumor.Cleave’s second flight in 1989, STS-30, also on Atlantis, came after NASA had reverted to flying all-male crews for three missions in the wake of the Challenger explosion in 1986, which killed all seven crew members on board, including the first teacher to be selected to fly to space.Cleave was known to downplay the “firsts” she marked as a female astronaut during her time at NASA, saying, “People tried to make a point of it, and I just let everybody know that I didn’t think that anybody should be making a special point out of this.“It was just a normal part of the thing, and I just didn’t think it was good to make anything special out of it, because at that point we really were part of the corps,” she added, noting that she was close friends with astronaut Judith Resnick, who died on Challenger.Cleave emphasized that to women on the corps at that time, the focus was always on their jobs.She was also part of a historic first when she served on NASA mission control’s CapCom — or capsule communication system — as Sally Ride became the first American woman ever to travel to space on the STS-7 mission in 1983. When Cleave spoke to Ride in orbit, it became the first female-to-female space communication in the agency’s history. Neither Cleave nor Ride acknowledged the milestone during their conversation.“I didn’t even notice it. Here’s Sally and I, we didn’t even notice it,” Cleave said, though a reporter did ask her about the event afterward.Over the course of her two shuttle missions, Cleave spent more than 10 days in orbit.She was assigned to another flight after STS-30. But Cleave said she began to have a change of heart as she waited to fly, spending four years on the ground between her first and second mission. During that time she became increasingly concerned about environmental issues.Cleave said she could see the planet changing as she stared back at Earth from space. “The air looked dirtier, less trees, more roads, all those things,” she told NASA’s Oral History Project.“I just couldn’t get that excited about what I was doing, because it wasn’t related to (the environment),” she added, referring to her job as an astronaut.Cleave said she made the difficult decision to move on from the corps and NASA’s astronaut hub in Houston, taking a role at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland in 1991. There, she worked on a project called SeaWiFS, an ocean-monitoring sensor that measured global vegetation, according to NASA.Cleave eventually moved to work at NASA’s headquarters in Washington, DC, in 2000, going on to become the first woman ever to hold the title of associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate — the top role overseeing the space agency’s research programs. In that role, Cleave “guided an array of research and scientific exploration programs for planet Earth, space weather, the solar system, and the universe,” according to NASA.She retired from NASA in 2007, choosing to engage in volunteer work and encourage young women to join scientific pursuits, according to her bio on the Maryland government’s website.",5309,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/world/mary-cleave-nasa-astronaut-obit-scn/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point dirtier environment pursuit astronaut doctoral program sally post retire project acknowledge canadarm pilot supersonic excite announce finish nature maryland american disaster airplane increasingly role spaceflight make center teacher airline headquarters great oversee year milestone reporter wait back solar exploration judith science master ecology attendant scientist remote part robotic include earth close ground change government volunteer history statement spoke orbit serve wake time blazer emphasize woman road focus home system neck interview course website oral accord apply seawifs mission passion call agency revert move tree associate explosion lose jet capcom corp female decision shuttle planet enamor cleave pave encourage street event dc veteran search monday select measure spent found resnick srms office action note space flight bob university gravy vegetation hub rule doctorate bio universe engineering arm administrator fly difficult license biological guy scientific board microbial concerned utah colorado earn goddard force marked eventually nasa state notice civil york begin global washington related age work sad add job operate travel directorate told choose communication research environmental hold cabana rumor young give engineer spending friend normal refer opportunity native lead special driver challenger member assign array kill atlantis houston weather grow short downplay control trail guide local star join air engage manipulator historic heart title capsule confirm ride mary study day sensor lab crew top affirmative,0.92535,0.1130156338293463,8.322948960302455,0.4353702844774272,0,2023-11-30

Argentina was set to join Jan. 1, 2024.At the time, President Alberto Fernández celebrated the invitation, saying it would help Argentina reach new markets.The bloc was formed by Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2009 and added South Africa in 2010.____",1777,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/argentina-join-brics-scheduled-member-mileis-transition-team-105284138,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,news mondino win host foreign lula leftist alberto schedule rhetoric advantage fernández south tucker united sworn brazilian importance populist make invite diana policy country year africa state brics campaign repeatedly president milei aire tone admirer related economy political add official government ago harshly team form invitation ally drastic election time bloc brazil business formerly implement minister relation fox preview interview trump reach former buenos downplayed exist luiz communist carlson threaten argentina diplomatic celebrate move previously alignment mile javier criticize develop donald senior china picked russia trail week join set august shift libertarian office inácio trade write x india break,0.9358,0.0,10.684525993883788,0.3255611672278338,0,2023-11-30
ABC,Trucking boss gets 7 years for role in 2019 smuggling that led to deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants,2023-11-30 14:20:00,BRIAN MELLEY Associated Press,"LONDON -- A trucking company boss who claimed he thought he was smuggling booze into Britain was sentenced Thursday to seven years in prison for his role in a human trafficking ring in which 39 Vietnamese migrants suffocated in a cargo container in 2019.Caolan Gormley was the last of 11 people to be convicted in London in the migrant smuggling scheme. Five of the suspects were convicted of manslaughter.Gormley, 26, from Armagh, Northern Ireland, was convicted on Monday of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration by a jury that deliberated for little more than an hour in the Central Criminal Court, known as the Old Bailey.Judge Richard Marks said Gormley “succumbed to temptation and greed” in the lucrative smuggling business.Gormley claimed he was being paid up to 3,500 pounds ($4,420) per truck load, the judge said, but evidence showed people paid up to 22,500 pounds ($28,418) each for what was billed as “VIP service.”“But for those deaths, I have no doubt whatsoever that this illegal importation of illegal immigrants would have continued, as would your involvement,” Marks said.Gormley had played a role in three shipments of migrants from mainland Europe to the United Kingdom, prosecutors said. One run ended with passengers seen jumping from the back of a truck near Orsett, England, and being driven off by awaiting vehicles. Another was intercepted by French officials, with the driver and migrants being allowed to go.Some of those migrants later were believed to have boarded the fateful shipping container that left Belgium on Oct. 22 and landed the next day on the English coast with all 39 aboard dead.As the temperature inside the container soared above 100 degrees F (38.5 C), the desperate people struggled to breathe and sent messages and recordings to loved ones that they thought they were going to die.About half of those who perished were from Nghe An province in north-central Vietnam. The 28 men, eight women and three children ranged in age from 15 to 44. They included a bricklayer, a manicure technician, an aspiring beautician and a college graduate.

ABC,Paraguay official resigns after signing agreement with fictional country,2023-11-30 14:15:00,The Associated Press,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- A Paraguayan government official was replaced after it was revealed that he signed a memorandum of understanding with representatives of a fugitive Indian guru’s fictional country, who also appear to have duped several local officials in the South American country.The revelation sparked a scandal — and lots of social media mockery — in Paraguay but it’s hardly the first time self-described representatives of the United States of Kailasa duped international leaders. Earlier this year, they managed to participate in a United Nations committee meeting in Geneva and also signed agreements with local leaders in the United States and Canada.Arnaldo Chamorro was replaced as chief of staff for Paraguay’s Agriculture Ministry on Wednesday shortly after it was revealed that he signed a “proclamation” with representatives of the United States of Kailasa.Among other things, the Oct. 16 “proclamation” expressed a “sincere wish and recommendation for the government of Paraguay to consider, explore and actively seek the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States of Kailasa and support the admission of the United States of Kailasa as a sovereign and independent state in various international organizations, including, among others, the United Nations,” according to a copy of the agreement posted on social media.Representatives of the fictional country met with Chamorro and Agriculture Minister Carlos Giménez, Chamorro said in a radio interview.During the interview, Chamorro recognized he didn’t know where Kailasa was located and said he signed what he characterized as a “memorandum of understanding” because they offered to help Paraguay with a variety of issues, including irrigation.Photos posted in Kailasa’s social media accounts also showed representatives of the fictional country signing agreements with local leaders of the María Antonia and Karpai municipalities. The social media account celebrated each of these signings.On Kailasa’s website, the fictional country is described as the “revival of the ancient enlightened Hindu civilizational nation which is being revived by displaced Hindus from around the world.” It is led by a self-styled guru, Nithyananda, who is wanted in India on several charges, including sexual assault. His whereabouts are unknown.Representatives of the United States of Kailasa participated in two U.N. committee meetings in Geneva in February, according to media reports.",2467,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/paraguay-official-resigns-after-signing-agreement-fictional-country-105281655,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,characterize leader express international post nation social seek south displace united sincere american replace carlos assault spark sign country year state indian medium explore proclamation radio ministry agreement civilizational understand kailasa include geneva aire wish offer signing whereabouts official fictional memorandum government february recommendation shortly time scandal revival charge relation minister duped chamorro guru interview fugitive buenos website committee mockery enlighten paraguay consider hindu accord actively variety argentina diplomatic celebrate sexual lead karpai show admission account representative report establishment lot revive described nithyananda organization recognize paraguayan copy earlier maría issue local municipality independent revelation locate chief meeting ancient giménez agriculture staff support manage wednesday antonia india reveal sovereign participate,0.96245,0.2432103769760843,14.305945945945949,0.2453703703703703,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,Gazans mourn loss of their libraries: Cultural beacons and communal spaces,2023-11-30 14:01:00,Mohamad El Chamaa,"BEIRUT — Amid the bombed-out buildings and thousands of dead in Gaza City, there is another often overlooked casualty: the embattled enclave’s shattered cultural institutions, particularly its few libraries.Both the Gaza Municipal Library and the Rashad al-Shawa Cultural Center — which hosted a meeting between President Bill Clinton and Yasser Arafat 25 years ago — have been shelled into rubble during the nearly two months of war as Israel attempts to destroy the militant group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.“The occupation planes targeted and turned the public library building into rubble and destroyed thousands of books, titles and documents recording the city’s history and development, as well as the destruction of the library’s language courses hall and other library facilities,” said a statement Monday from the local government, which also described the destruction of the Shawa center and the municipal printing press.The municipal authorities called the strikes an attempt “to spread a state of ignorance in society.” It is unclear when the institutions were destroyed, as it has only been since the pause in fighting began on Nov. 24 that many parts of the city have become accessible again.The Israeli assault, which has mainly focused on Gaza City and the northern half of the strip, came in response to a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 that left about 1,200 people dead. Civilians, however, have borne the brunt of the response, and at least 13,300 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip, while 80 percent of its inhabitants have been displaced.Amid all the destruction, residents have barely had the opportunity to grapple with the loss of the densely populated enclave’s few cultural institutions that locals recall as refuges and rare beacons of culture.The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to questions about the strike.Photos taken by the municipality showed the main library building gutted from the inside, with books scattered on a floor covered with debris and dust, and few shelves intact.The library system included the Gaza Municipal Library as well as a cultural center and a library for children. It was a gathering space for events and a venue for students, families and writers.According to the Gaza municipality’s website, the library was founded in 1999 through a twinning agreement with the French city of Dunkirk and funding from the World Bank. The library consisted of two floors and a basement. Its holdings included 10,000 volumes in Arabic, English and French.The Rashad al-Shawa Cultural Center and its accompanying Diana Tamari Sabbagh Library, which opened in 1988, also lies in ruins. It was here that on Dec. 15, 1998, with Clinton looking on, that hundreds of Palestinian fighters voted to remove the Palestine Liberation Organization’s charter of clauses calling for the destruction of Israel. The vote paved the way for a meeting at the Erez crossing between Arafat, Clinton and Israel’s young prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who at the time described the PLO vote as “a real change, a very positive change.”“The library was a calm place. It had a quiet cafeteria and the place was always breezy, especially in the summer,” said Abdalhadi Alijla, a Sweden-based academic from Gaza who described to The Washington Post how he started frequenting the Shawa center when he was 15.Museums, archaeological heritage sites and university campuses in Gaza have all been damaged and destroyed in Israeli attacks during the current offensive, according to human rights and cultural heritage groups. Israel has said some of the sites, including the Islamic University of Gaza, were used by Hamas operatives.A 2010 survey by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics found that there are 13 public libraries operating in the Gaza Strip. Most of the libraries in Gaza are poorly equipped, according to a 2020 talk by Gaza-based poet and New Yorker contributor Mosab Abu Toha, who founded the first English-language library in Gaza in 2017.That library, named in honor of the late Edward Said, the Palestinian literary critic and Columbia University professor, began by crowdsourcing many of its volumes. Some were from the private collection of its namesake, donated by his widow, Mariam Said, and some funding was received from Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen.There has been no information about the current condition of the Edward Said Library.Abu Toha said he first had the idea for the library in 2014, after walking into the ruins of the Islamic University of Gaza, which was hit during a previous round of Israeli strikes.He noted that Gazans face an uphill battle in importing books into the enclave, as shipments cannot go straight to Gaza — which is blockaded by Israel and Egypt — and are instead delivered to the West Bank. In his 2020 talk, Abu Toha described the situation as “asking the head of an American library to travel through Mexico to pick up a parcel in Guatemala.”As news circulated this week of the damage to the libraries, stunned and saddened residents took to social media to mourn the loss. One user on X with the name of Gazabibliophile wrote: “Many memories and eternal friendships I’ve lived with in the Gaza Public Library!”Another simply said, “Do you know what the Mongols did when they invaded Baghdad?” in a reference to the sacking in the 13th century of one of the Islamic world’s preeminent literary centers.The Gaza City municipality called on UNESCO to protect Gaza’s cultural institutions, noting that such places are “protected under international humanitarian law.”UNESCO said it was “deeply concerned about the adverse impact that fighting could have on any cultural heritage in Palestine and Israel, which comes in addition to UNESCO’s concerns before the ongoing fighting about the state of conservation of sites in Gaza due to the lack of local public policies on heritage and culture,” in a statement to The Post.It added that it has urged all sides to respect international law, noting that “cultural sites are civilian infrastructure that cannot be targeted and cannot be used as military sites.”The library would “be missed by female students who used it as a safe space,” Alijla said. The books could be replaced, “but we also lost a place of gathering,” he said.",6322,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/30/gaza-library-palestinian-culture/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,equip news poorly accessible lack international strike host information alijla eternal yasser uphill post spread palestinian cross social loss casualty gaza mariam import american inside ongoing center real venue diana clinton year israel military sadden medium tamari agreement dead abdalhadi part turn include viet site battle civilian change student government densely circulate late development history statement hit library amid urge gazans time offensive dust charter thanh walk especially honor due basement ruin focus reference occupation netanyahu system shelf volume abu course plane toha website cultural invade dunkirk parcel rare erez destroyed sack start shell accord accompany family mexico operating call addition city side simply french impact israeli grapple stun lose islamic current edward resident straight pause female summer embattle organization facility southern refuge hamas holding particularly pave pulitzer municipal baghdad event printing campus rashad monday attack document meeting frequent idea benjamin safe destroy found talk academic english statistic question write collection note donate novelist open x space record university shatter month palestine receive strip left breezy instead egypt gutted unesco percent adverse quiet attempt gathering central populate crowdsourcing concerned replace assault policy calm force west funding preeminent state book bill liberation private twin place target president begin survey northern ignorance protect heritage namesake washington borne infrastructure critic militant add plo bank building arabic mourn ago respect travel contributor debris yorker gazabibliophile cover damage vote beirut mosab arafat recall young child live minister humanitarian columbia literary archaeological remove cafeteria destruction prime miss clause rubble half opportunity inhabitant world mongol deeply shipment overlook public positive language consist authority widow show head law user professor pick defense previous friendship kill institution fighter described round respond barely control poet week deliver local municipality concern scatter group beacon lie brunt century thousand blockade response culture unclear title sabbagh fight human conservation bureau hundred condition enclave shawa hall situation floor immediately memory,-0.9938,0.0474533375514077,10.897465277777776,0.251254368121838,0,2023-11-30
ABC,What to know about the Sikh independence movement following US accusation that activist was targeted,2023-11-30 13:58:00,SHEIKH SAALIQ Associated Press,"NEW DELHI -- The U.S. has charged an Indian national in what prosecutors allege was a failed plot to assassinate a Sikh separatist at the behest of an unnamed Indian government official.The charges announced Wednesday against an Indian national arrested in June in Europe come two months after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were credible accusations that India may have been linked to the killing of a Sikh activist near Vancouver, straining relations between the two countries.The U.S. case is particularly sensitive given the high priority that President Joe Biden placed on improving ties with India and courting it to be a major partner in the push to counter China’s increasing assertiveness.India, which has banned the Sikh independence — or Khalistan — movement, denied having a role in the Canada killing and said it was examining information shared by the U.S. and taking those accusations seriously.Here are some details about the issue:India's Sikh independence movement eventually became a bloody armed insurgency that shook India in the 1970s and 1980s. It was centered in the northern Punjab state, where Sikhs are the majority, though they make up about 1.7% of India’s overall population.The insurgency lasted more than a decade and was suppressed by an Indian government crackdown in which thousands of people were killed, including prominent Sikh leaders.Hundreds of Sikh youths were also killed during police operations, many in detention or during staged gunfights, according to rights groups.In 1984, Indian forces stormed the Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, in Amritsar to flush out separatists who had taken refuge there. The operation killed around 400 people, according to official figures, but Sikh groups say thousands were killed.The dead included Sikh militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, whom the Indian government accused of leading the armed insurgency.On Oct. 31, 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who ordered the raid on the temple, was assassinated by two of her bodyguards, who were Sikh.Her death triggered a series of anti-Sikh riots, in which Hindu mobs went from house to house across northern India, particularly in New Delhi, pulling Sikhs from their homes, hacking many to death and burning others alive.There is no active insurgency in Punjab today, but the Khalistan movement still has some supporters in the state, as well as in the sizable Sikh diaspora beyond India. The Indian government has warned repeatedly over the years that Sikh separatists were trying to make a comeback.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has also intensified the pursuit of Sikh separatists and arrested dozens of leaders from various outfits that are linked to the movement.When farmers camped out on the edges of New Delhi to protest controversial agriculture laws in 2020, Modi’s government initially tried to discredit Sikh participants by calling them “Khalistanis.” Under pressure, the government later withdrew the laws.Earlier this year, Indian police arrested a separatist leader who had revived calls for Khalistan and stirred fears of violence in Punjab. Amritpal Singh, a 30-year-old preacher, had captured national attention through his fiery speeches. He said he drew inspiration from Bhindranwale.India has been asking countries like Canada, Australia and the U.K. to take legal action against Sikh activists, and Modi has personally raised the issue with the nations' prime ministers. India has particularly raised these concerns with Canada, where Sikhs make up nearly 2% of the country's population.Earlier this year, Sikh protesters pulled down the Indian flag at the country’s high commission in London and smashed the building’s window in a show of anger against the move to arrest Amritpal Singh. Protesters also smashed windows at the Indian consulate In San Francisco and skirmished with embassy workers.India’s foreign ministry denounced the incidents and summoned the U.K.’s deputy high commissioner in New Delhi to protest what it called the breach of security at the embassy in London.The Indian government also accused Khalistan supporters in Canada of vandalizing Hindu temples with “anti-India” graffiti and of attacking the offices of the Indian High Commission in Ottawa during a protest in March.",4299,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/sikh-independence-movement-us-accusation-activist-targeted-105281280,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,partner flag leader improve information participant pursuit nation holiest canadian preacher commissioner announce independence farmer role center make canada year commission raid fear ministry bhindranwale gunfight dead outfit personally order active include initially vancouver intensified burning sikhism government europe detention deputy separatist violence drew pull detail accusation edge link youth home london today operation ban prosecutor embassy hindu accord trigger security court call deny move share sensitive amritsar withdrew punjab narendra protest sizable allege skirmish tie bodyguard supporter denounce trudeau china arrest refuge dozen particularly issue priority singh san smash ottawa attack activist flush accuse office agriculture action gandhi shrine wednesday majority strain francisco speech anger consulate month prominent foreign arm bloody diaspora high counter pressure unnamed assassinate joe controversial credible inspiration crackdown stag country shook force eventually suppress state indian place biden repeatedly president delhi series northern raise national june protester militant examine fiery official house discredit building vandalize figure temple movement khalistan police hack justin indira give death charge minister relation sikh attention prime fail storm graffiti amritpal plot major lead riot show law insurgency decade kill breach revive summon case camped modi incident behest legal concern stir group capture mob thousand increase jarnail warn march australia golden india window push,-0.9942,0.6978367062107466,13.14735978112175,0.396721158958001,0,2023-11-30
ABC,Wartime Israel shows little tolerance for Palestinian dissent,2023-11-30 12:58:00,AMY TEIBEL Associated Press,"JERUSALEM -- Bayan Khateeb knows she's a terrible cook. So when she managed to pull off a dish of cooked tomatoes and eggs, she took a photo to show friends on social media.“Soon we shall eat the Shakshouka of victory!” crowed her caption, which included an emoji of the Palestinian flag.Khateeb intended the Oct. 8 Instagram post as a joke, she said. But in the fraught atmosphere that has gripped Israel since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, statements that might have once sounded innocuous have taken on more sinister meaning and resulted in scores of arrests.A classmate saw the post and thought Khateeb, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, was cheering on Hamas. When the post was shared more widely, Khateeb suddenly found herself accused online of supporting terrorism. The next thing she knew, she was suspended from her studies at a prestigious university, ejected from her dorm, fired from her two jobs and interrogated in shackles by Israeli police.“I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're arresting me, after I was subjected to two weeks of political persecution?"" she said. ""How did I end up in this situation?”She was among more than 270 Palestinian citizens who have been arrested in an Israeli crackdown on free speech and political activity since the Hamas attack, according to Adalah, an advocacy organization for Palestinians inside Israel.Palestinian citizens have also reported intimidation, firings and expulsions from universities, as well as surveillance of their online speech by other civilians.“People are arrested for anything expressing sympathy for the civilian victims in Gaza,” said lawyer Abeer Baker, who represents another woman who was arrested. “Everything that was not in favor of attacking Gaza as such actually puts you in danger of being arrested.”The arrests go to the heart of the dual identity of Palestinian citizens as they struggle to navigate a Jewish-majority society. Palestinian citizens have equal rights on paper but have historically suffered from discrimination in job opportunities, housing, health care and education. The community is one of Israel’s poorest.The arrests also raise questions about Israel’s commitment to free speech and the rights of its Palestinian minority, which accounts for a fifth of the country’s nearly 10 million people.“We have undergone many wars. Never was such suppression ever declared before,” said Hassan Jabareen, the director general of Adalah. “People among themselves speak about living under a dictatorial regime. A Jewish, racist dictatorship.”Police did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Some of the Palestinian citizens arrested over the past five weeks allegedly expressed outright support for Hamas and its onslaught.“There is nothing better than to wake up to the terror and fear of the Zionists, and missiles falling on their heads,” a preschool aide is accused of posting.But others have been detained because authorities either misinterpreted posts or conflated support for the people of Gaza with support for terrorism, critics say. Prominent Arab leaders in Israel have been arrested for challenging a ban on anti-war protests, and two Arab lawmakers were sanctioned for remarks related to the Hamas attack.Baker's client, singer and neuroscientist Dalal Abu Amneh, didn't expect to find herself behind bars when she went to Israeli police to file a complaint about threats she received in response to an online post. But like Khateeb, she found herself in shackles and in jail after posting “No victor but God” on social media, with an emoji of the Palestinian flag, on the day of the Hamas attack.“Dalal believes in God. It means he is the only one who can bring justice, who can bring peace,” Baker said. “This sentence was interpreted wrongly as if she said Palestine will win.”Jews aren’t immune from punishment, although it is rare. Earlier this month, a court extended the remand of a Jewish teacher who posted anti-war and anti-occupation messages on Facebook and was fired from his job, the Haaretz daily newspaper reported.Videos posted on social media by Israeli police delivered an unmistakable message: There will be zero tolerance for any identification with the Gaza Strip and the enclave’s Hamas rulers.“We are at war and the orders are unequivocal: There will be zero tolerance for any incident,” Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai said in one video.“Anyone who wants to be a citizen, ahlan wasahlan,” Shabtai said, using the Arabic phrase for welcome. “Anyone who wants to identify with Gaza is also welcome — I’ll put them on a bus and send them there.”Danny Danon, a lawmaker in the ruling Likud Party, said only a small number of Israel's Arab minority have crossed the line. ""But when you see those incidents of radicals trying to promote violence, I think it’s necessary to stop it at the initial stages,” he said.Asked whether officials may have gone too far in their crackdown, he said: “I trust our legal system.”The arrests have unfolded under the most right-wing government in Israel's history and amid the trauma of the Hamas attack, which killed at least 1,200 people and resulted in over 240 others being taken hostage.The violence has not spared Israel’s Palestinian citizens: At least 21 were killed in the initial attack and by rocket and mortar fire launched by Hamas and its Lebanese Hezbollah ally, said Atta Abu Mtegem, mayor of the Bedouin city of Rahat. Seven are missing, and possibly captured by Hamas, he said. Others, including soldiers, have died in the fighting.At the same time, the images of devastation coming out of Gaza have been wrenching for a community with close ties to Palestinians there and in the West Bank. The death toll from Israel’s assault on Gaza has topped 13,000, according to health authorities there. Airstrikes have leveled wide swaths of the territory and displaced more than two thirds of its 2.3 million people.Following the Hamas attack, some Palestinians have been afraid to go to work or mix with Jews, and lawyers and professors are afraid of running afoul of undefined new limits on speech, Jabareen said.More than 100 Palestinian citizens have been suspended or expelled from universities and colleges over posts, according to Adalah. Arab students at one college had to be extricated from their dormitory after hundreds of Jews, some chanting “Death to Arabs,” protested outside, accusing them of disrupting a Sabbath prayer service and hurling eggs, Israeli media reported.Many Palestinian citizens are afraid to post messages online for fear they will be detained.“The reality is so bleak that if you call for a cease-fire, you must be a supporter of terrorism,” Hanin Majadli, a journalist and editor at Haaretz, wrote in an Oct. 29 opinion piece. “This is the way they continue to deepen the idea of ‘the enemy within us.'More than 50 of the Palestinian citizens who have been arrested have been indicted. Indictments have also been filed against eight Jewish defendants alleging racially motivated violence, but not for online behavior or the dorm incident.Lawmakers have also entered the fray with new legislation criminalizing the “systematic consumption of terrorist content” and allowing the government to block or shutter foreign media deemed hostile to the state.Interior Minister Moshe Arbel, meanwhile, has instructed authorities to look into stripping a Palestinian actress of her Israeli citizenship for posting material that included laughing emojis on a photo of an elderly woman being taken into captivity by Hamas militants, with the caption, “She is going on the adventure of her life.”For now, Khateeb is living in limbo. Her suspension from her data science and engineering program is open ended. She's unemployed, living with her parents and waiting to see if she gets indicted.",7785,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/wartime-israel-shows-tolerance-palestinian-dissent-105278925,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,stage suffer flag run express leader minority amneh racist activity tomato bayan widely image threat program post opinion palestinian racially fraught cross data social laugh unequivocal hurl commissioner promote spar peace indict gaza displace toll health inside chant mortar trauma zionist mayor teacher dormitory israel wait level hostile equal dual result medium fear science egg rocket represent rahat advocacy paper sentence ahlan order include small firing singer close political million civilian facebook afoul unmistakable justice student government hassan request history statement cook aide atmosphere missile amid violence wake pull ally identification time woman jerusalem god instagram crow dorm unfolded lebanese citizen outright abu emoji neuroscientist enter trust interpret gripped rare ban find terrible navigate accord message behavior continue court declare call community motivate newspaper city share afraid shabtai report israeli dish protest society score client eject allege tie supporter swath past organization knew service surveillance actress unemployed defendant identity arrest indictment commitment welcome hamas systematic likud cheer prayer shakshouka interrogate attack idea deem classmate enemy found fire bedouin accuse mtegem photo extend emojis intend question write open wide jewish challenge extricate fall initial fray undefined speech university consumption number free bring discrimination bleak month legislation palestine prominent conflate strip receive engineering subject foreign expect citizenship persecution allegedly instruct suddenly terrorism jabareen bar elderly cooked criminalize historically majadli atta limit stop housing party crackdown believe assault shutter detain launch victim country west parent limbo nightmare undergone piece khateeb daily moshe suspension airstrikes block send raise wrongly struggle related work dictatorial critic militant wasahlan job official disrupt bank arabic sound jew abeer hanin identify tolerance director shackle adventure felt topped living editor police victory file terrorist online baker put punishment death misinterpret soldier victor minister friend remark general miss radical sanction suppression zero joke phrase opportunity lawyer complaint jail sympathy authority journalist sabbath regime reality show head haaretz account meaning sinister expel professor captivity kill prestigious hezbollah caption respond eat arbel innocuous arab possibly mix suspend incident remand earlier week deliver legal favor territory wrench expulsion line immune dalal capture multiple deepen danger response content heart ruling kobi college preschool lawmaker bus study day devastation hundred enclave support speak manage situation intimidation material danny education danon terror,-0.99605,0.3082851637764932,10.2217325017325,0.4317878787878786,0,2023-11-30
ABC,A deadline for ethnic Serbs to sign up for Kosovo license plates has been postponed by 2 weeks,2023-11-30 12:48:00,The Associated Press,"PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo's government on Thursday postponed a deadline by two weeks for ethnic Serbs living in the country to register their vehicles with Kosovo license plates instead of Serbian ones.The move was made to give ethnic Serbs more time to comply with the order. The deadline was initially set for Friday, but has been moved to Dec. 15.The program has financial incentives, including the waiving of taxes and the registration fee. After the deadline passes, old number plates would be considered illegal, and violators would first be fined and then have their vehicles towed if they didn't subsequently abide by the new rules.In recent days, Associated Press journalists have seen scores of ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo lining up to register their vehicles. Authorities say that about 3,000 vehicles out of an estimated 4,000 ones have been registered so far.The issue of vehicle registration has sparked tensions in the past.

ABC,Members of global chemical weapons watchdog vote to keep Syria from getting poison gas materials,2023-11-30 12:46:00,The Associated Press,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The annual meeting of member states of the global chemical weapons watchdog on Thursday called on countries to prevent the sale or transfer to Syria of raw materials and equipment that could be used to create poison gas and nerve agents.The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said in a statement that its annual conference “decided that the continued possession and use of chemical weapons” by Syria, and its failure to give the organization an accurate inventory of its stocks and to “destroy undeclared chemical weapons and production facilities,” have harmed the international Chemical Weapons Convention.The decision was backed by 69 nations, while 10 voted against it and 45 nations abstained.It calls on member states to take measures to “prevent the direct or indirect transfer to Syria of certain chemical precursors, dual-use chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment and related technology.”Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 to ward off the threat of airstrikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of the country’s capital.Damascus denies using chemical weapons. However, an investigative team at the OPCW that seeks to identify forces responsible for using chemical weapons has found evidence indicating repeated use of chemical weapons by Syria in the country’s grinding civil war.Other member nations of the Hague-based OPCW suspended Damascus’ voting rights at the organization in 2021 over the attacks.In August, U.N. deputy disarmament chief Adedeji Ebo told the Security Council that Syria had failed to provide the OPCW with a full accounting of its program, citing “gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies” in its declaration to the organization.",1725,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/members-global-chemical-weapons-watchdog-vote-syria-poison-105278430,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,weapon equipment conference nerve international prohibition threat program indirect grind undeclared stock nation opcw fail ebo decide seek accurate provide responsible security declaration call manufacturing indicate investigative member country force possession direct chemical back damascus state civil voting organization precursor facility suspend airstrikes global discrepancy decision ward outskirt poison related prevent accounting harm join gap chief gas repeat august denies netherlands meeting continued response attack adedeji identify measure statement hague evidence told thursday destroy syria failure inconsistency raw deputy found council team create disarmament watchdog vote annual full material give production inventory transfer,-0.9804,0.0,13.864027777777777,0.3204846435615666,0,2023-11-30
ABC,"Protesters shove their way into congress of Mexican border state of Nuevo Leon, toss smoke bomb",2023-11-30 12:30:00,The Associated Press,"MEXICO CITY -- The legislature of Mexico's northern border state of Nuevo Leon said Thursday protesters broke through doors, took over the floor of the state congress and launched a smoke bomb.The chaotic scene took place late Wednesday after the state legislature named an interim governor to take the place of Gov. Samuel García, who took a leave of absence to pursue a run for the presidency in Mexico’s June 2 elections.García wanted someone from his Citizen’s Movement party to replace him, but the legislature named someone else to serve for the six-month leave, and the protesters were angry about that.Shouting “Sell outs! Sell Outs!” dozens of protesters broke open a door and flooded the floor of the legislature, after which thick smoke soon filled the chamber.“Members of the public who were unhappy with the process carried out during the session broke into the floor to try to prevent it from being carried out,” the state congress said in a statement. “They attacked security personnel, advisers and even tossed a smoke bomb that filled the chamber.”Nuevo Leon, across the border from Texas, is an important industrial hub. García hopes his youthful, social media-savvy campaign can attract younger voters, but critics say Mexican ruling parties have long promoted third-party candidates with little hope of winning, to divide the opposition vote.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador defended Garcia Thursday, saying other parties hated him because he threatens to split the opposition vote in the June election. López Obrador's Morena party holds a lead in polls on the race.“There is a lot of rage, a lot of ill feeling, a lot of anger directed at Samuel,” López Obrador said at his morning press briefing.García issued a statement claiming the state congress vote betrayed those who voted for him. He said the man who was named — current state assistant prosecutor Luis Enrique Orozco — was not qualified to hold the interim post.“We are not going to tolerate vandalism, illegal and anti-democratic acts,” García said. “We are going to defend respect for the law, respect for institutions and the will of (the people) of Nuevo Leon.”Since he took office in 2021, García has faced a severe water crisis that left much of Monterrey, the state capital, without service for weeks. He has also bragged about his friendship with Elon Musk, and has touted hopes that a Tesla plant will be built in his state.",2420,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/protesters-shove-congress-mexican-border-state-nuevo-leon-105277721,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hub run anger win left divide broke morena andrés leave press fill social illegal promote leon capital party replace launch important poll opposition legislature enrique adviser state industrial feel act monterrey qualify place campaign assistant attract northern border lópez tolerate protester june built critic severe water candidate late brag statement manuel respect personnel elon serve mexican movement tout vote vandalism hold carry election young pursue citizen flood nuevo prosecutor long samuel plant security mexico absence public city lead tesla luis member betrayed law sell voter direct claim current friendship smoke lot angry institution morning service thick dozen week chaotic presidency issue prevent threatens youthful defend split garcia rage hope orozco attack ruling thursday interim process congress governor office crisis obrador bomb gov toss open unhappy musk wednesday scene floor texas session garcía,-0.9729,0.2479338842975206,9.633172866520788,0.4763888888888888,0,2023-11-30
ABC,A Dutch court orders Greenpeace activists to leave deep-sea mining ship in the South Pacific,2023-11-30 12:17:00,MIKE CORDER Associated Press,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A Dutch court ruled Thursday that Greenpeace protesters staging a sit-in must leave a deep-sea mining exploration ship in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii but that they can continue to demonstrate around the vessel.Canada-based The Metals Company, whose subsidiary Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. runs the ship, Coco, accused the protesters of endangering the crew and breaking international law.The case was heard in Amsterdam, where the Greenpeace protest ship Arctic Sunrise, which is involved in the protest, is registered.Greenpeace began the protest a week ago by paddling kayaks beneath the Coco for up to 10 hours at a time to prevent it deploying equipment in the water. Two activists also boarded the ship and pledged to stay camped on the main crane used to deploy and retrieve equipment from the water until The Metals Company agrees to leave.The protest comes as international demand for critical minerals found on the seafloor grows, but an increasing number of countries say more research is needed into the environmental impacts of deep-sea mining.A subsidiary of The Metals Company has been conducting exploratory research in the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific since 2011. They say data from their latest expedition, researching how the seabed recovered from exploration last year, will be used in an application to begin mining in 2025.In a summary ruling, Amsterdam District Court said that Greenpeace can “continue its actions around a ship in the South Pacific, but must instruct its activists to immediately leave"" the vessel.The court said that while Greenpeace has a profound interest in protesting against the research ""its interest in doing so on the ship itself weighs less heavily than the interest of the owner of the ship, who is responsible for the safety of those on board.”The court said Greenpeace would have to pay 50,000 euros ($54,560) per day up to a maximum of 500,000 euros if the activists remain on the ship.A Greenpeace statement called the ruling “a massive setback for the deep-sea mining industry."" It also lashed out at The Metals Company, claiming it “has never been interested in scrutiny and they can’t stand that Greenpeace is watching and opposing them at every turn.”""We are determined to keep bringing this dangerous industry to public attention and will continue to disrupt this dangerous industry”, said Mads Christensen, head of Greenpeace International.The Metals Company CEO & Chairman Gerard Barron welcomed the ruling.“We respect Greenpeace’s right to peaceful protest and expression of opinions,"" Barron said. ""However, our foremost responsibility is to ensure the safe continuance of our legally-mandated operations, and the safety of all those involved.""He said the company would “continue to gather the important scientific data” for members of the International Seabed Authority.Environmental groups reject deep-sea mining and fear the international authority will soon authorize the world’s first license to harvest minerals from the ocean floor.",3053,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/dutch-court-orders-greenpeace-activists-leave-deep-sea-105277441,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bring equipment run rule gerard responsibility greenpeace company international beneath profound clarion leave opinion instruct ceo data exploratory interest license gather paddle south demand scientific euro board chairman continuance mads stag setback country important year recover authorize reject maximum safety industry exploration fear kayak harvest determine begin interested resource heavily oppose arctic protester water disrupt late seabed retrieve ago subsidiary pledge statement hawaii respect research environmental remain conduct hour grows time watch attention barron nauru district foremost operation lash involve continue responsible court ocean mexico ensure world dangerous call stay public expression authority zone massive head application ship member demonstrate impact agrees protest peaceful claim heard christensen seafloor case camped summary weighs crane critical welcome week prevent deploy expedition group mining coco pacific netherlands ruling hague activist safe thursday pay found owner accuse increase day metal dutch amsterdam sunrise action crew endanger mineral clipperton stand floor number immediately break scrutiny,0.8460000000000001,0.6878480183426139,12.608468809073724,0.4761904761904763,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,Russia bans international LGBT movement as ‘extremist’,2023-11-30 10:42:00,"Robyn Dixon, Natalia Abbakumova","RIGA, Latvia — Russia’s Supreme Court on Thursday banned the “international LGBT public movement” as an extremist organization — even though the alleged movement has no organizational structure, leaders, membership, website or address.While seemingly preposterous — given that there is no such organized movement — the Russian ban, nonetheless, could have sweeping implications for LGBT people in Russia. It could be used to prosecute any LGBT organization, activity, communication or mutual support initiative, including those online.While critics called the ruling legal nonsense, the Kremlin appears to be banking on global homophobia as a unifying ideology that will align intolerant countries — particularly in the Middle East and Africa — against the liberal West.In many Middle Eastern and African nations, homosexuality is illegal. Anti-LGBT polices have long been a populist cause, for example in Uganda, which criminalized same-sex relationships earlier this year, including imposing a potential death penalty for “aggravated” homosexuality.The ruling, which was delivered in a closed hearing, shocked liberal Russians, and prominent independent Russian media organizations on Thursday displayed the LGBT flag on their social media pages in solidarity with LGBT people.Judge Oleg Nefedov ordered that the ban, which followed a motion to the court from the Justice Ministry, come into effect immediately.The ban will probably force LGBT groups to operate in secret and could be used against LGBT people, although the legal implications remain far from clear.Activists said Russian authorities were using the court system to criminalize and persecute LGBT people.A striking element of the ban is its sweeping, amorphous nature, raising uncertainty about what actions and organizations may be targeted as extremist. It is a form of legal obscurantism often used by the regime of President Vladimir Putin, sowing confusion and fear about how to avoid arrest and, potentially, prison.Renat Davletgildeev, an LGBT activist, journalist and author of the Russian Telegram channel Gay Dynamite, called the ruling “absurd, extrajudicial, illegal.”Davletgildeev said the case resembled the absurdist writings of Franz Kafka, Eugène Ionesco or Samuel Beckett. “But this is not the reality in which we exist,” he said. “I can’t fit it in my mind.”“The illegality of this whole process was observed from the first days,” Davletgildeev said. “We sent both individuals and legal entities a petition to the Supreme Court asking to be made interested parties. We have all been denied.”A ban could force the disbanding of rights groups such as Delo LGBT+, which provides legal advocacy for queer people in court; Center T, a group representing transgender people; the Russian LGBT Network; and others. Activists who try to support LGBT people could be charged and imprisoned for 10 years. Individual participants in the movement could face six-year terms.The wording of the Justice Ministry motion implied that LGBT people are part of a shadowy global organization with extremist goals set on harming Russia.The Kremlin has long asserted that the West, particularly the United States and its European allies, are enemies of so-called traditional family values and are responsible for promoting “decadent” lifestyles.None of the arguments or evidence presented to the court by the Justice Ministry were public, nor was any legal representative of LGBT organizations permitted to appear to argue against a ban. The court denied an application by representatives of the Russian LGBT Network and others to appear as interested parties.The secrecy around the court hearing reinforced fear and anger in Russia’s LGBT communities that authorities are using the judicial system to sow hatred against them, and to smear them as representing “decadent” Western values.One Russian LGBT Telegram channel, Guys+, called the judgment a “parody” and an “attempt by the state to humiliate LGBTQ+ people and recognize them as second-class citizens.”“The trial of all of us is taking place without us,” the group said on Telegram.A Russian cultural magazine, Discourse, announced its solidarity with LGBT people and said it plans to publish underground material in support of them.The ban comes after two previous repressive Russian laws against LGBT people: a ban on “LGBT propaganda,” which criminalized the spread of any information about LGBT identities, and a ban on transgender transition — both changing a person’s sex in official documents, as well as the use of surgery or hormones.It comes as Putin is pressing a regressive agenda of “traditional” values, with growing restrictions on abortion and officials urging women’s careers and education to be put aside in favor of having many babies at a young age.Putin has frequently attacked transgender people and parental or marital rights for LGBT people as alien to what he calls the “Russian world.”However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that the Kremlin was not tracking the highly controversial court case.Davletgildeev, the activist and journalist, said that because the hearing was conducted in secret, it was not clear what might constitute extremist behavior. “A gay-okay T-shirt, or a rainbow keychain, or an LGBT Instagram account or a social media post — we don’t know.”Russian LGBT organizations were scrambling to publish advice to LGBT people on how to protect themselves, in an environment where the legal implications were murky. Davletgildeev advised LGBT-identifying Russians to flee the country, and called on international rights organizations to help people from those groups find refuge outside Russia.Pro-Kremlin analyst Yevgeny Minchenko raised doubts about the Justice Ministry motion in comments posted on Telegram before the Supreme Court endorsed the motion to ban the international LGBT movement: “Is there such an organization? Is it possible to join it? Is there a charter, a program, a leadership and so on? It seems to me that if we are talking about an extremist organization, it must have the characteristics of such an organization,” he wrote.Minchenko said the legal implications of the ruling were unclear: “Will its nonexistent offices be shut down? There are more questions than answers to the situation.”",6292,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/30/lgbt-russia-movement-extremist-banned/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,liberal implication potentially flag aggravate leader unify international strike organize sow information activity participant environment effect program post decadent nation spread press social sex ionesco illegal promote possible traditional channel announce nature uganda keychain united populist make center preposterous year initiative africa clear hatred murky amorphous advice marital alien medium fear element latvia ministry characteristic part interested represent order advocacy analyst include observe abortion spokesman close banking persecute impose constitute ideology eugène justice change scramble gay motion evidence western form urge remain ally russian woman goal instagram endorse charter organizational transgender system extremist shut plan confusion website cultural dmitry ban find baby argument prosecute long behavior provide queer responsible samuel family court call community deny shadowy author agenda middle hearing secret allege imply highly organization structure judicial recognize kremlin identity arrest refuge probably particularly nefedov advise illegality independent discourse harm set putin homosexuality attack document nonsense permit petition activist thursday enemy talk franz office action question obscurantism beckett reinforce riga repressive anger seemingly prominent european east network criminalize attempt surgery track controversial party underground country force west transition penalty present state absurd eastern place target comment president magazine global person assert davletgildeev parody raise protect african relationship potential critic kafka official supreme operate sweep nonexistent membership communication secrecy nonetheless movement absurdist conduct propaganda homophobia police displayed young give put death charge flee shock dynamite regressive exist doubt disband page word argue publish public authority answer journalist reality regime delo application account uncertainty law representative follow parental previous solidarity oleg restriction rainbow case resemble avoid grow career yevgeny smear russia earlier deliver legal favor value leadership join trial peskov group minchenko individual fit extrajudicial entity unclear ruling frequently vladimir humiliate mutual writing process lgbt day support telegram imprison situation align material judgment education intolerant,-0.99215,0.572155117609663,12.388675799086757,0.3230589022757697,0,2023-11-30

Saul Loeb/Pool/AFP via Getty Images hide caption U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, left, and Israel's President Isaac Herzog meet in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Thursday following the announcement of an extension of the truce between Israel and Hamas just before it was due to expire. TEL AVIV, Israel — Hours after Hamas released another 16 captives in exchange for 30 Palestinians held by Israel, the two sides announced Thursday that they had agreed to extend their cease-fire in Gaza by at least another day to continue the hostages-for-prisoners swaps. News of the extended pause in fighting came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel and amid an early morning shooting at a bus station on the outskirts of Jerusalem, where two two gunmen opened fire, killing three Israelis. Hamas claimed responsibility for the bus stop attack. Israel's military did not immediately comment on the Hamas claim. The shooting is the first Palestinian attack on civilians since the Israel-Hamas war began last month. Early Thursday, officials in Qatar, where the truce was negotiated, announced the extension of the pause in fighting under the same conditions as in the original deal a week ago. Both Israel and Hamas confirmed the revised deal, meaning more hostages are set for release later Thursday in return for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Late Wednesday, Hamas released 10 Israelis and four Thai citizens that its fighters captured in the Oct. 7 attack launched from Gaza on Israeli border communities that killed about 1,200 people, Israel says. Hamas seized around 240 hostages in the assault. Tens of thousands of Thais, Filipinos and people of other nationalities work on farms, construction and Israel's service sector. Two Israeli-Russians were also released as part of what Hamas has described as a side-deal facilitated by Russian President Vladimir Putin, the third such release since the exchanges began on Friday. Israel released 30 Palestinians in accordance with the cease-fire arrangement, which calls for three Palestinians to be freed in exchange for every Israeli turned over by Hamas. The latest move to prolong the truce that has temporarily halted Israel's bombardment of Gaza coincided with Blinken's arrival in Israel to push for a more permanent resolution to the conflict. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has repeatedly said that Israeli forces will resume operations to ""crush Hamas"" once the truce expires. Blinken met Thursday with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who thanked the U.S. ""for the immense work it is devoting to the release of the hostages."" He also mentioned by name the Bibas family, still being held hostage. Israel says the family, including the parents, a 4-year-old girl and 10-month-old infant, were handed off by Hamas to another Palestinian militant faction, but Hamas says the mother and children were killed in an Israeli airstrike. ""Their whereabouts are unknown to us and we are demanding their immediate release,"" Herzog said. Blinken said that ""from day one"" the U.S. has focused on trying to secure the hostages' release. He called the swaps of captives this week ""a very positive development."" ""It's also enabled an increase in humanitarian assistance to go to innocent civilians in Gaza who need it desperately,"" Blinken said. ""So this process is producing results. It's important, and we hope that it can continue."" The Hostages and Missing Families Forum believes that Hamas still holds 145 hostages from Oct. 7, including 27 women and four minors — one girl and three boys all under the age of 18. The secretary of state also mentioned Thursday's attack near the entrance to West Jerusalem. He said the killings emphasize ""the threat from terrorism that Israel and Israelis face every single day. And like you, my heart goes out to the victims of this attack."" People visit the scene after a shooting attack near a bus stop on Thursday in Jerusalem. The shooting left three dead and 16 wounded, according to authorities. Amir Levy/Getty Images hide caption People visit the scene after a shooting attack near a bus stop on Thursday in Jerusalem. The shooting left three dead and 16 wounded, according to authorities. Surveillance video from the attack shows two gunmen exiting a car and firing on a group of civilians waiting at a bus stop. A police statement, quoting medical sources, said three civilians were killed and 16 injured, by two assailants of East Jerusalem armed with an M-16 rifle and a handgun. It said the two ""were neutralized on the scene shortly after the attack by two off-duty (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers and another civilian who fired at them."" In a statement afterward, the Hamas military wing claimed ""full responsibility"" for the attack and said it was a response to the deaths of Palestinian women and children in Gaza and the West Bank since Oct. 7. In a statement posted on X (formerly Twitter), Netanyahu offered condolences to the families of the victims and said his government would expand its efforts to distribute weapons to Israeli civilians. Also on X, war cabinet minister Benny Gantz said the bus stop attack ""is further proof of our obligation to continue to fight with strength and determination against murderous terrorism, which threatens our citizens. In Jerusalem, Gaza, in Judea and Samaria, and everywhere,"" he wrote. Judea and Samaria are biblical names often used in Israel to refer to the West Bank. On Wednesday, Palestinian officials said Israeli troops killed an 8-year-old and a 15-year-old during a raid on the Palestinian city of Jenin. Israel's military says it killed two militants in the raid. In Gaza, where the week-long pause has temporarily halted Israel's relentless air-and-ground campaign against Hamas, at least 13,300 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, according to Gaza's health ministry. While the cease-fire has allowed desperately needed aid to reach many Gazans, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said Wednesday that the delivery of aid ""remains completely inadequate to meet the huge needs of more than two million people."" The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its latest update that aid convoys, which had been unable to reach areas north of an informal line bisecting Gaza, continued through Wednesday. It said that the Palestine Red Crescent Society and UNRWA, the U.N. relief agency that oversees the Palestinian territories, ""delivered food and non-food items, medical supplies, and fuel to shelters hosting internally displaced persons (IDPs), as well as to warehouses and hospitals. The latter included two hospitals in Gaza city, Al Ahli and As Sahaba, which received a total 10,500 liters (nearly 2,800 gallons) of fuel, enough to operate generators for about seven days."" Aid distribution in areas of south Gaza, where the majority of internal displaced people are staying, include fuel for hospitals, water and sanitation facilities, as well as cooking gas that ""has been entering daily from Egypt since the start of the pause,"" OCHA said.

CNN,Nepal registers its first same-sex marriage,2023-11-30 07:55:00,not specified,"Local authorities in a village in Nepal registered the Himalayan nation’s first same-sex marriage on Wednesday, officials and activists said, five months after the Supreme Court issued an interim order clearing the way for such marriages in the largely conservative country.The marriage between 36-year-old Ram Bahadur (Maya) Gurung, who was born male but identifies as female, and Surendra Pandey, 26, who was born and identifies as male, was formally registered at the Dordi rural municipality office in the Lumjung district in west Nepal, an official said.“We are both very happy.

CNN,Chinese celebrity chef vows to never cook egg fried rice again after nationalist backlash,2023-11-30 07:45:00,Nectar Gan,"Light, tasty and simple to make, egg fried rice has long been a beloved dish in China and one of most recognizable icons of Chinese cuisine around the world.But in recent years, the popular stir-fry has become a highly sensitive subject for China’s online nationalists, especially around the months of October and November.Emotions are running so high this week that one of the country’s most famous chefs has been forced to apologize – for making a video on how to cook the dish.“As a chef, I will never make egg fried rice again,” Wang Gang, a celebrity chef with more than 10 million online fans, pledged in a video message on Monday.Wang’s “solemn apology” attempted to tame a frothing torrent of criticism about the video, which was posted on Chinese social media site Weibo on November 27.Angry nationalists accused Wang of using the video to mock the death of Mao Zedong’s eldest son, Mao Anying, who was killed in an American air strike during the Korean War on November 25, 1950.Wang’s video was solely about making egg fried rice, but for some Chinese nationalists, any mention of the dish around the anniversary of Mao Anying’s death or birthday on October 24 amounts to a deliberate act of insult and mockery.However, by attacking mentions of egg fried rice by famous chefs and other online influencers, the nationalist users have inadvertently promoted the very rumor their government is trying to quash.The controversial account has it that Mao Anying, an officer in the People’s Liberation Army, disobeyed orders to take shelter during the air raid. Instead, the hungry young man fired up a stove to make egg fried rice, which sent smoke into the air and gave away his position to enemy jets.That version of events was mentioned in the memoir of Yang Di, a military officer who worked alongside the younger Mao at the commander’s headquarters. But Chinese authorities have repeatedly refuted it as rumor.Under leader Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has cracked down on voices that criticize national heroes or question the official narrative about them. In 2018, the country passed a law to ban the slander of national “heroes and martyrs,” a crime punishable by up to three years in prison.Last May, former investigative journalist Luo Changping was sentenced to seven months in prison for “insulting martyrs” who froze to death during a Korean War battle. He had used a pun on social media to suggest that Chinese soldiers portrayed in a blockbuster movie about the war were stupid.On the 70th anniversary of Mao Anying’s death in 2020, the Chinese Academy of History – an official think tank launched by Xi to counter “incorrect” views of Communist Party history – called the egg fried rice story “the most vicious rumor.”“These rumormongers have tied up Mao Anying with egg fried rice, dwarfing the heroic image of Mao Anying’s brave sacrifice to the greatest extent,” the academy said in a post on social media site Weibo. “To put it in one sentence – their hearts are evil.”It discredited Yang’s memoir as “full of flaws and cannot withstand verification at all.” Citing other eyewitness accounts and declassified telegrams, the post concluded that Mao Anying was killed because enemy forces detected radio waves from the busy telegraphs coming in and out of the headquarters in the days leading up to the air raid.Despite official denials, the disputed egg fried rice story has persisted. In some corners of the Chinese internet, November 25 is celebrated as the “Egg Fried Rice Festival” or “Chinese Thanksgiving” – a nod to the belief that if the younger Mao had survived the war, he might have inherited power from his father and turned China into a hereditary dictatorship like North Korea.In 2021, a Weibo user in the southern city of Nanchang was detained by police for 10 days for commenting in a post that “the greatest achievement of the Korean War is egg fried rice.”“Thank you egg fried rice. Without it, we would be the same as (North Korea) now,” the post said.Wang’s egg-fired rice video, posted two days after the anniversary of the younger Mao’s death, was seen as particularly egregious as it was far from his first “transgression” – at least in the eyes of Chinese nationalists.In 2018, Wang posted a video introducing his homemade egg fried rice recipe on October 22. Two days later, on Mao Anying’s birthday, Communist Party mouthpiece the People’s Daily shared Wang’s video. The move raised eyebrows and drew accusations that even the party’s flagship newspaper had been corrupted.In 2020, Wang posted a video of himself making Yangzhou fried rice – a deluxe version featuring ham, shrimp, peas and carrots in addition to eggs – on October 24, which sparked a nationalist outcry. Wang responded by issuing a swift apology.“I only found out about this situation after I posted the video today and saw everyone’s comments,” he wrote in comments underneath the video. “I’m only sharing the delicious food and have no other motives.”After the latest backlash on Monday, Wang explained in his apology that his team had posted the video without his knowledge.“This video has caused a lot of trouble and a very bad experience for everyone. I apologize again,” he said after taking down the cooking video. “I was busy with personal matters recently and did not participate in the release of the video. This was my biggest mistake.”Wang, 34, who hails from a rural village in Sichuan province, said his grandfather had been a veteran of the Korean War and spent six years in North Korea.He said he looked up to his grandfather and dreamed of becoming a soldier since childhood, but failed the physical examination to join the army at 17. “In my mind, soilders are very sacred,” he said.But Wang’s critics are not letting it go easily.“It might be a coincidence the first time. But can it be a coincidence every single time?” a comment said of Wang’s egg fried rice videos.Some called for Wang to be banned on Chinese social media, while others urged authorities to punish him for insulting national “heroes and martyrs,” citing the 2018 law.But some have also come to Wang’s defense, noting that the chef has posted egg fried rice in other months throughout the year.“You don’t need to apologize. It is society that should apologize to you,” a Weibo user said in support of Wang.“Why don’t we clearly stipulate a complete ban on eating and making egg fried rice in November, or simply retire egg fried rice from Chinese cruisine all togther,” another supporter quipped.Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief for Global Times and a prominent nationlist voice, cautioned that many people are still unaware of the rumors about Mao Anying. He called for public opinion to be more tolerant of unintentional mentions of “relevant elements” around the younger Mao’s birthday and death anniversary.“Being more tolerant of each other and not making this into a hot topic is by and large a comfort and protection to martyr Mao Anying’s heroic spirit. It will help the issue gradually quiet down and weaken the rumor’s damage,” Hu wrote.“Otherwise, it is possible that a controversy after another will only strengthen the rumor’s impact.”On Tuesday, Wang removed the video of his apology and closed the comment sections on his Weibo page.",7258,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/china/china-celebrity-chef-egg-fried-rice-backlash-intl-hnk/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hero story run nanchang leader version strike pass achievement image post vicious opinion delicious retire social promote possible extent dwarf busy influencers examination american swift dispute chinese movie make spark portrayed headquarters great year insult voice military matter act feature dream medium trouble chef celebrity raid disobeyed element hereditary deluxe egg xi turn order internet sentence eye sacred underneath inadvertently hungry close food recently site north million battle power thanksgiving homemade unintentional incorrect government late froze history pledge mao cook anying team urge famous drew spirit time apology especially province eyebrow accusation mention hail comfort today officer xijin froth ban physical alongside torrent long big birthday message complete tolerant mind simple call celebrate addition city newspaper move strengthen release personal investigative simply share light gang sensitive cuisine november dish sacrifice refute society smoke solemn tie supporter october highly southern china beloved tame single memoir particularly issue controversy event veteran monday attack spent enemy yangzhou found fire childhood accuse crack commander view korea eldest jinping question write note section full suggest father yang cruisine weaken cooking month grandfather prominent carrot hot subject tank instead high withstand flaw counter army quiet attempt persist backlash outcry controversial party relevant away detain launch verification country force heroic unaware mouthpiece crime deliberate belief liberation soilders large radio comment daily repeatedly pea rumormonger changping global slander denial raise popular national work corner critic conclude official stipulate discredit wang egregious wave topic protection stove survive academy detect blockbuster damage festival police nationalist online rumor nationlist solely recognizable young give put death soldier martyr experience remove luo former prison caution recipe fail introduce criticism communist page zedong narrative participate amount public authority journalist punishable lead punish account sichuan video law rice user telegraph gradually shrimp transgression defense kill lot inherit eyewitness criticize tuesday declassify respond shelter eat apologize anniversary week fry tasty join rural air coincidence explain weibo recent heart nod position korean day flagship support telegram togther brave situation icon dictatorship mock village,-0.9611,0.2480022044640397,8.745365168539326,0.4159882005899705,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,Henry Kissinger’s central role in the U.S. carpet bombing of Cambodia,2023-11-30 07:04:00,"Rebecca Tan, Regine Cabato","Nowhere is the debate over the legacy of former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger more searing than in the countries that bore the brunt of his military polices, such as Cambodia. Historians say his decisions led to decades of violence that have continued to haunt Cambodian society.For many in the country, Kissinger’s impact was not abstract but visceral and continues even after his death. Land mines planted during Cambodia’s three-decade-long civil war, which was driven in part by U.S. interference, are still exploding today. In neighboring Vietnam and Laos, officials are also still undergoing the painstaking process of identifying and removing unexploded ordnance from a war that Kissinger helped to wage five decades ago.“The sad reality is, he leaves this legacy which many, many Cambodians still pay the price for,” said Sophal Ear, a Cambodian American political scientist. “To this day, there are people who … lose limb and life in the process of trying to make a living in a land that has been filled with bombs.”From 1969 to 1973, as national security adviser and secretary of state under President Richard M. Nixon, Kissinger directed the carpet bombing of large swaths of Cambodia that U.S. officials at the time claimed were sanctuaries for communist insurgents from South Vietnam as well as North Vietnamese soldiers. Ben Kiernan, a historian at Yale University and a leading scholar of the U.S. legacy in Cambodia, has estimated that around 500,000 tons of U.S. bombs were dropped on Cambodia during this period and killed as many as 150,000 civilians.The scale of this bombing campaign, internally called Operation Menu, was kept secret from the American public for many decades, though leaked and declassified records have revealed that Kissinger personally “approved each of the 3,875 Cambodia bombing raids.” In 1970, according to declassified transcripts of his telephone conversations, Kissinger spoke to Nixon about the situation in Cambodia before relaying the following order to his deputy Alexander Haig: “He wants a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. … It’s an order, it’s to be done. Anything that flies, on anything that moves. You got that?”In later decades of his life, particularly as declassified documents detailed the extent of the U.S. assault on Cambodia, Kissinger drew intense criticism for his leading role and was labeled by some as a “war criminal.” He dismissed these critiques and maintained that the Cambodia bombing was milder than later U.S. bombing campaigns.“I bet if one did an honest account, there were fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from American drone attacks,” he said in a 2014 interview with NPR. Many researchers dispute this. Historian Greg Grandin, who wrote the book “Kissinger’s Shadow,” said that at least one area in Cambodia known to have “sizable concentrations” of civilians was bombed nearly 250 times.Historians have also widely credited the U.S. bombing campaign with contributing to the rise of the totalitarian Khmer Rouge regime, which carried out a host of atrocities during its four-year rule, including the genocide of minority groups. An estimated 2 million people — or about 1 in 4 Cambodians at the time — were killed under the Khmer Rouge, led by dictator Pol Pot. Of 5 million survivors, at least a quarter live with trauma, say local researchers.Hun Sen, who recently stepped down as Cambodia’s prime minister after a nearly four-decade rule, began his political career as a commander for the Khmer Rouge and has said that he felt compelled to join the insurgent force because the United States had bombed his hometown.Until the early 1970s, the rural communities of eastern Cambodia had never experienced the horrors of aerial bombardment. “This was something beyond our imagination. … An invisible evil that was extremely frightening,” said Youk Chhang, executive director of the Phnom Penh-based Documentation Center of Cambodia. Over four years, it became a potent tool used by the Khmer Rouge to recruit new fighters, he added.“Mr. Richard Nixon and Kissinger allowed the Khmer Rouge to grasp golden opportunities,” Kaing Khek Iev, a Khmer Rouge official known as Brother Duch, said during a trial by a U.N.-backed tribunal in 2009.A few top Khmer Rouge leaders were tried by the tribunal and handed life sentences. Kissinger, however, faced little accountability for his role in his lifetime, rights activists say.",4445,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/30/henry-kissinger-cambodia-bombing-war/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,greg leader minority host widely carpet contribute fill extent henry casualty south united tool survivor american role dispute trauma make rise center year military researcher scientist part personally order sentence compel include kiernan aerial political recently experienced north totalitarian million interference civilian credit visceral spoke lao mr deputy dismiss violence drew quarter time maintain nixon genocide documentation bombed today insurgent interview estimate operation atrocity explode hand accord continue security brother limb call community executive move claimed sear iev impact secret richard direct lose sizable bet ear swath cambodia invisible decision land particularly internally accountability drop bombing document continued attack painstaking activist detailed grasp pay approve commander price write khek record university critique rule npr secretary scale transcript fly driven relay alexander kissinger menu sanctuary assault country vietnam force ordnance adviser state book debate large civil eastern haig campaign undergo president begin legacy early extremely national sad life unexploded step scholar official rouge cambodian yale concentration identify imagination director kaing period conversation felt living haunt historian vietnamese police carry recruit leak label chhang death youk khmer wage soldier live minister honest remove former grandin milder prime shadow intense criticism communist opportunity plant phnom bore leaf frighten public lead abstract regime reality massive account evil follow duch decade kill fighter declassify dictator career potent neighbor local join rural bombardment group trial brunt sophal area drone lifetime process horror day telephone bomb golden top situation reveal pol tribunal,-0.9926,0.809898762654668,10.637435265104806,0.3876728322182868,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,World reacts to Henry Kissinger’s death and legacy in wars,2023-11-30 07:03:00,"Ben Brasch, Rebecca Tan, Leo Sands","The death Wednesday of Henry Kissinger — a centenarian, former secretary of state and figurehead of American power on the world stage — has sparked a wave of reaction across the globe to his polarizing legacy.He shaped world affairs under two presidents with his realpolitik approach to diplomacy and remained active in influencing U.S. foreign policy for the nearly half-century since he left government. He was an admired geopolitical strategist in Washington, while people who opposed his policy objectives often viewed his actions far more harshly.“Secretary Kissinger really set the standard for everyone who followed in this job,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday of Kissinger. Blinken added that he had sought counsel from the former diplomatic chief many times, including most recently about a month ago.“He was extraordinarily generous with his wisdom, with his advice. Few people were better students of history. Even fewer people did more to shape history than Henry Kissinger,” Blinken said.Former president George W. Bush was among the first public figures to comment publicly on Kissinger’s death. “America has lost one of the most dependable and distinctive voices on foreign affairs,” Bush said in a statement late Wednesday, which was accompanied by a portrait of Kissinger painted by Bush. “I am grateful for that service and advice, but I am most grateful for his friendship. Laura and I will miss his wisdom, his charm, and his humor.”Critics have long held Kissinger responsible for expanding the Vietnam War to Cambodia, first with “secret bombing” in 1969 and then with an incursion into eastern Cambodia by U.S. ground forces the following year. Kissinger has been blamed by critics for coups in Chile and Cyprus, and for backing oppressive government actions in Iran and Pakistan.Some of the reaction to Kissinger’s death was harsh. His obituary in Rolling Stone was headlined “Henry Kissinger, War Criminal Beloved by America’s Ruling Class, Finally Dies.”However, Kissinger’s supporters have argued that even his more controversial foreign policy projects promoted stability and were born of pragmatism in an effort to advance U.S. objectives. He is credited with organizing rapprochement between the United States and China, as well as orchestrating détente with the Soviet Union in the early 1970s.Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo described Kissinger as “a model of service” and recalled his escape from Nazi Germany as a teenager, his military service during World War II and his “indelible mark on America’s history and the world.”“I will always be grateful for his gracious advice and help during my own time as secretary,” Pompeo said on social media. “Always supportive and always informed, his wisdom made me better and more prepared after every one of our conversations.”Russian President Vladimir Putin singled out Kissinger’s reputation as a pragmatist in a tribute that celebrated his role in that détente, describing him as an “outstanding diplomat, a wise and farsighted statesman” in a telegram sent to Nancy Kissinger, the late diplomat’s wife.Russia’s leader praised Kissinger for his “pragmatic foreign policy line, which at one time made it possible to achieve détente in international tensions and reach the most important Soviet-American agreements that helped strengthen global security,” according to the Kremlin website.Kissinger’s death was mourned by officials and state media in China, which he visited more than 100 times. In February 1972, he forever altered global power relations by orchestrating a historic visit by President Richard M. Nixon to China, the result of behind-the-scenes overtures that laid the groundwork for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Washington.Beijing’s ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, praised Kissinger for the role he played. “History will remember what the centenarian had contributed to China-U.S. relations, and he will always remain alive in the hearts of the Chinese people as a most valued old friend,” Xie said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.In the Middle East, Kissinger’s style of “shuttle diplomacy” helped stabilize Israel’s relations with the Arab world after the 1973 Middle East war and established Washington’s role as a power broker in the region — to the detriment of Soviet influence. In a statement shared to X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described him as a “giant” of “formidable intellect and diplomatic prowess.” Netanyahu said: “Each meeting with him was not just a lesson in diplomacy but also a masterclass in statesmanship.”Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida directly referenced Kissinger’s role in facilitating the rapprochement between the United States and China. “He made significant contributions to the regional peace and stability,” Kishida told reporters Thursday. “I would like to express my sincere respect to the great achievements he made.”Another decisive foreign policy move that Kissinger made in Asia was in East Timor, half of an island in the Indonesian archipelago. In 1975, along with then-President Gerald Ford, Kissinger gave Indonesian dictator Suharto an implicit go-ahead to invade East Timor, prompting a bloody civil war and famine that left as many as 200,000 people dead, according to documents that were declassified in the early 2000s. In the following decades, even after East Timor gained independence in 2002, Kissinger denied that he played a role in Indonesia’s massacre.“Those who follow history, who follow international politics — they know about this past, which was tragic and ugly,” José Ramos-Horta, the president of East Timor and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said in an interview Thursday with The Washington Post, in which he reflected on Kissinger’s role in greenlighting an Indonesian invasion of the former Portuguese colony decades ago.He said he had met Kissinger several times after his country gained independence. The U.S. official was “respectful,” he said, but never directly addressed his nation’s struggle for independence.“They are embarrassed by what they did,” Ramos-Horta said, referring to Kissinger and other U.S. officials involved in the Timor policy. “We are free now. That’s what is most important.”",6259,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/11/30/henry-kissinger-death-reactions-controversy/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,stage forever leader express international organize japanese antony america asia achievement post broker famine nation region contribute indonesia project social facilitate promote possible henry union gracious significant peace independence sincere united american chile role politics blinken chinese make spark important laureate great year israel reporter voice roll military oppressive advice prepared centenarian medium result teenager directly geopolitical agreement colony generous dead détente island active include affair objective alter portrait ground recently power fumio credit student government expand influence late paint history ambassador statement cyprus backing prompt nobel shape laid laura remain russian time distinctive nixon george formerly wisdom escape reference groundwork netanyahu tragic stabilize interview style invade prize invasion timor describe diplomat reflect long accord involve responsible accompany security josé address celebrate deny move strengthen share inform tension middle sought israeli indonesian secret richard lose embarrass supporter admire past cambodia service china beloved kremlin single shuttle grateful harsh gerald approach set putin bombing pompeo meeting globe document benjamin thursday iran stability incursion view action achieve x wednesday ugly portuguese headline free month suharto kishida secretary left east diplomacy foreign bloody class greenlighting criminal played nazi finally kissinger controversial contribution respectful wise policy country vietnam force orchestrate state model eastern effort civil comment president global soviet washington struggle early figurehead oppose critic add job official extraordinarily february figure mourn wave respect reputation overture told standard mark outstanding archipelago publicly bush decisive born recall give death coup realpolitik minister supportive relation rapprochement friend reach former prime normalization miss blame pragmatism statesman dependable strategist praise refer lesson half regional remember argue world visit diplomatic public nancy giant charm formidable beijing farsighted follow germany friendship decade implicit declassify described dictator xie arab intellect ford pragmatist held pragmatic reaction value establish line polarize advance chief detriment alive stone historic counsel heart ruling vladimir mike telegram obituary tribute feng indelible masterclass,0.99675,0.3834478351174308,11.105030891438652,0.4193840579710143,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,"What to know about the kaffiyeh, a symbol of the Palestinian cause",2023-11-30 07:00:00,"Maham Javaid, Dan Rosenzweig-Ziff","It originated as a headdress worn across the Arab world for protection against the sun, sand and sweat. Now, the kaffiyeh has come to symbolize solidarity with the Palestinian cause, cropping up on the streets of some major U.S. cities and at global demonstrations held since the start of the Israel-Gaza war.The checkered garment made headlines this month when a man shot and wounded three college students of Palestinian descent — two of whom were wearing kaffiyehs — on a quiet street in Burlington, Vt. Families of the victims said they feared the crime was fueled by hate; authorities told reporters they are still working to determine a motive.The kaffiyeh, a fabric that in modern days is often worn as a scarf, comes in many colors. The black-and-white version has been associated with Palestinians for decades, according to Ted Swedenburg, a University of Arkansas professor who has studied the garment for over 40 years.In the 1930s, Palestinians revolted against the British mandate for Palestine, years after Allied powers divvied up the defeated Ottoman Empire — Syria and Lebanon were given to France, and the British were mandated Palestine and Iraq. During a major Arab revolt in the 1930s, Swedenburg said, some rebel commanders ordered Palestinians in the cities of the British mandate to wear the kaffiyeh, leading a garment once worn mostly by farmers and rural peasants to routinely appear in urban areas as well.Over the course of the 20th century, the kaffiyeh grew in prominence. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat began wearing it in the 1960s, and Palestinian men donned it to disguise themselves while throwing stones at Israeli soldiers in the 1980s during the first intifada, according to Swedenburg. The kaffiyeh also started being seen as contentious by some who connected the headdress to the violence.In the 1990s and 2000s, the kaffiyeh became a popular fashion item, while also becoming representative for some of struggles for liberation across the globe.“It’s a cultural symbol that has taken on national significance for Palestinians,” said Khaled Elgindy, the director of the Middle East Institute’s Program on Palestine and Israeli-Palestinian Affairs. “At its core it’s just a traditional Arab scarf that’s become popularized because of the Palestinian struggle.”A kaffiyeh is a traditional headdress worn through much of the Middle East. It can be styled as a scarf, wrapped around one’s head with a ring or draped around one’s shoulders. It can be checkered red or black or green, and can have different symbols on it that reflect the country in which it’s worn.Saudi Arabia’s kaffiyeh, for example, looks different from that of Syria’s, which looks different from the one associated with Palestinians.The kaffiyeh, however, predates many of the borders that exist today, said Nael Alqassis, the spokesperson for Hirbawi Kufiya, which claims to be the only remaining manufacturer of kaffiyehs in the West Bank. Originally, the large cloth served multiple purposes, Alqassis said, which included “keeping sun, sand and sweat off the faces of farmers.”“They were used to transport farmers’ meals to the farms, or they could be sat or prayed upon when you were away from home,” he said.Alqassis said that while there is no documentation on this, he believes that the black-and-white kaffiyeh only became popular in Palestine after the 1950s, when the clothing item began to be produced on mechanical looms, which worked better with limited colors.“Before that, in old paintings you can see Palestinians wearing very colorful kaffiyehs,” he said, adding that in the 2010s Hirbawi again “returned to its roots by producing kaffiyehs of many colors.”The kaffiyeh for many is a symbol for Palestinian identity and their hope for independence.“It’s like a flag,” Swedenburg said. “But you can wear it on your body.”He noted that since the Nov. 25 shooting of the students in Burlington, there has been a larger push for people to wear kaffiyehs to show their unity with those of Palestinian descent. But the kaffiyeh’s origins as a popular symbol date back further.In 1936, a large uprising in Mandatory Palestine that came to be known as the Great Revolt occurred against British rule and the growing Jewish population. Sherene Seikaly, a history professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said the Great Revolt solidified the kaffiyeh’s identity and was worn widely. The garment became “a political symbol to confuse the authorities from making distinctions on class, identity and location in 1936,” she said.Elgindy with the Middle East Institute noted that the scarf carries “political symbolism of resistance as part of the liberation struggle,” not just for Palestinians, but also for many struggling for freedom more widely.That symbolism has also made the kaffiyeh controversial for those who connect it to violence in pursuit of that independence.In the last two months, the kaffiyeh has received backlash across the United States, Germany and other Western countries.On Oct. 13, Berlin’s education senator, Katharina Günther-Wünsch, offered all Berlin school principals the option to ban students from wearing the traditional kaffiyeh scarves, The Washington Post previously reported.In France, a participant of a pro-Palestinian rally said in mid-October that he had been fined 135 euros (roughly $140) for wearing the kaffiyeh, according to CNN.Some experts said the image of the kaffiyeh shifted when Arafat, a longtime leader of Palestinian nationalism, brought the already symbolic kaffiyeh into American living rooms by making it an indispensable part of his wardrobe during international appearances and interviews. While Arafat renounced terrorism in 1988, the group he led, the Palestine Liberation Organization, had a history of political violence that left a lasting stamp on his legacy.“When the audiences in the ’80s saw Arafat always wearing it, they began associating the scarf with something bad,” said Evan Renfro, professor of political science at the University of Northern Iowa. “Now some people say similar things about the American Palestinian congresswoman who wears it.”In 2019, after a photo of Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) wearing the kaffiyeh went viral, the AP ran a fact check about how the garment embodied Palestinian solidarity and did not represent the militant group Hamas.Anyone, including non-Palestinians, can wear a kaffiyeh, experts said. Seikaly said she believes that Palestinians do not find it offensive when others wear the scarf.“It’s a symbol of Palestinian liberation that has broad resonance with Black liberation and colonial liberation,” she said. “So anyone is free to wear it.”Alqassis, the spokesperson for Hirbawi Kufiya, said the company sells to customers worldwide, including in Micronesia, French New Guinea and Iceland.",6838,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/30/kaffiyeh-symbolism-meaning-history/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,flag leader ted colonial company international version participant pursuit yasser widely image resistance intifada program post palestinian customer item traditional allied shot shoot headdress farmer cloth color united american check rally make elgindy descent great unity year embody reporter indispensable manufacturer back fuel lebanon symbolize ottoman freedom green nationalism fear mandate science originally part represent order include affair viral political power student expert mandatory history routinely serve fabric western violence remain prominence california offensive renfro home documentation spokesperson today interview style course santa cultural core barbara ban find draped empire distinction start reflect accord family vt wrap predates nael city institute previously french middle israeli associate sun sell claim iowa ran organization uprise throw identity location arkansas wardrobe seikaly sweat street hate popularize symbolism shift divvied hirbawi commander photo contentious note jewish peasant iceland university headline free colorful fashion rule month broad palestine population receive left east red date sand demonstration symbol tlaib class produce terrorism khaled arabia berlin significance loom quiet rebel brought euro backlash controversial believe stamp away occur victim burlington country option similar west wound school painting disguise limited state crime liberation large modern originate symbolic connect determine begin global northern border kufiya shoulder struggle washington offer popular audience national work militant solidify wear longtime add urban scarf bank resonance appearance british protection director told syria living crop roughly arafat carry worn give france sherene soldier congresswoman purpose guinea worldwide checker meal room exist ring iraq evan katharina micronesia world alqassis major authority lead confuse show head transport farm different return representative black clothing kaffiyeh professor germany solidarity decade sat renounce origin arab grow swedenburg held principal rural revolt group multiple century hope defeat stone prayed college fin fact area senator day study rashida mechanical root education garment push,-0.70305,0.0877449546651067,11.085737308622075,0.3678894716394716,0,2023-11-30
CNN,China mourns Kissinger — ‘a most valued old friend’,2023-11-30 05:30:00,Simone McCarthy,"The death of Henry Kissinger on Wednesday saw the loss of a diplomat Beijing has long considered a trusted friend, with China’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday hailing the former American secretary of state as “a pioneer and architect of China-US relations” for his central role in the establishment of bilateral ties.Paying tribute to the late statesman during a regular press briefing, ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said “the Chinese people will remember Dr. Kissinger’s sincere devotion and important contributions to China-US relations.”Chinese leader Xi Jinping had sent his condolences to President Joe Biden, Wang added.Kissinger’s death was also mourned on Chinese social media Thursday, where his passing became the top trending topic on heavily moderated microblogging site Weibo with more than 400 million views.“Farewell, old friend of the Chinese people,” said a top comment with thousands of likes.“The person who started a period of history has finally become history,” another comment said.Considered a highly influential but controversial figure in the United States and around the world, Kissinger is highly regarded in China for his role laying the groundwork for the formation of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Washington – a crucial and highly consequential step in the country’s reengagement with the world.In July 1971, Kissinger became the first high-ranking US official to visit Communist China. His secret meeting with Chinese leaders paved the way for then President Richard Nixon’s breakthrough trip the following year.That visit, in turn, opened the door for the normalization of ties between the world’s richest country and its most populous in 1979.“There is no more important diplomat in the 20th century than Henry Kissinger, certainly with regard to US-China relations, he has left an indelible mark,” said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank in Washington.Long after Kissinger left office, Beijing had regarded the well-connected diplomat as a potential helping hand in navigating the increasingly hawkish views towards China in Washington. Amid fraught relations in recent years, Chinese state-controlled media has celebrated former diplomat in an apparent signal of signal their displeasure with the tougher stance taken by US administrations.In a statement Thursday, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, said he was “deeply shocked and saddened” to learn of Kissinger’s passing.“History will remember what the centenarian had contributed to China-US relations, and he will always remain alive in the hearts of the Chinese people as a most valued old friend,” Xie said on social media X.Chinese state media highlighted Kissinger’s friendship with China, noting that he visited the country more than 100 times over half a century. State broadcaster CCTV called him a “living fossil” who witnessed the development of US-China relations.Many state-run outlets cited a glowing quote from Kissinger’s interview with official news agency Xinhua in 2011. “China is the country with which I have the longest and most in-depth contacts. China has become a very important part of my life. Chinese friends are of extraordinary significance to me,” the American diplomat was quoted as saying. And even amid growing tensions – as recent US administrations have grown increasingly alarmed by China’s aggressive foreign policy and authoritarianism at home –– Kissinger remained a strong advocate of positive engagement to avoid conflict.Kissinger last traveled to China in July, when the Biden administration was busy dispatching cabinet officials to the Chinese capital in an attempt to restore fractured communications ahead of a potential visit to the US from Xi, which took place earlier this month.Bilateral relations had then plunged to a new low following the fallout from an alleged Chinese spy balloon and a high-level US visit to selfTaiwan last summer.On his surprise visit to Beijing, Kissinger was granted a meeting with Xi who hailed him as an “old friend.” That made him stand out from US climate envoy John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who traveled there on separate trips that same month and only met with their counterparts.Kissinger also met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who told him “US policies toward China require Kissinger-style diplomatic wisdom and Nixon-style political courage.”On that trip, Kissinger was held up in Chinese state media as an example of “old friends diplomacy,” according to Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, referring to China’s practice of pointing to international figures who have contributed to positive, stable relations between their country and China.“Chinese media very clearly tried to paint the picture that ‘this is good diplomacy,’ and Kissinger is forward-looking and has goodwill for mitigating the tensions between two countries — and other current diplomats are not like Kissinger,” said Wu, adding that Beijing was, in reality, not aiming to be a “close friend” of the US in its own diplomacy.“Kissinger, the Flying Tigers, all are part of the story of the US-China relations ‘golden model’ or ‘good old days’ that Xi Jinping wants to promote,” Wu said, referring to American pilots who helped China fight Japan during World War II, who were recently highlighted in state media coverage ahead of Xi’s US visit.But among some Chinese intellectuals there are “mixed feelings” about Kissinger’s legacy, with some saying he only tried to promote peace with China, and didn’t have principles when it came to China’s political realities, Wu added.Kissinger’s covert 1971 visit to China as Nixon’s national security advisor followed more than two decades of hostility and almost no contact between the two countries.That trip, where he met Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, and a second visit that same year, paved the way for Nixon’s own breakthrough trip the following February and the signing of the carefully worded Shanghai Communique, where both sides agreed to work toward normalizing relations.The tectonic shift in US-China relations that was formalized some eight years later opened the door for extensive economic engagement starting from the early 1980s. It also shifted the balance of power in the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union, experts say, by deepening a split between Moscow and Beijing.But getting there was a significant challenge.“There were a variety of voices in the United States in the 1960s quietly calling for finding a path toward normalization with China … but it took very careful, wise diplomacy to actually implement and get that process rolling,” said Kennedy at CSIS in Washington, pointing to both sides’ management of key differences.Fifty years later, Kissinger’s brand of pragmatism and what experts describe as his efforts to put aside ideological differences for strategic purposes appears at odds with the recent trajectory of the US-China relationship. While Biden and Xi met earlier this month to ease tensions, the friendly public gestures belied the mistrust on both sides, with each seeing the other as seeking to use or co-opt the current world order in their favor.“It’s more difficult for the US and China to find a pragmatic balance because the domestic politics in both countries … (have) shifted dramatically,” said Kennedy.“It’s really hard to think today that we would have the US and others engage in that kind of creative diplomacy with China … and (other) countries with which we have the biggest differences,” Kennedy added. “That’s what Kissinger was able to do.”",7738,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/china/china-kissinger-tributes-old-friend-intl-hnk/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point story news mistrust leader international bilateral press fraught contribute social friendly pilot separate administration promote henry union loss busy capital significant peace sincere united american increasingly role politics chinese center make brand xinhua passing economics important year difference voice roll dramatically sadden carefully centenarian medium stable principle ministry john xi witness authoritarianism part turn wu order heavily stance path spokesman close signing political recently shanghai site million regard power aggressive trajectory expert development management late microblogging paint history ambassador statement devotion picture grown amid kennedy remain kuan zhou condolence consequential time economic fossil odds csis wisdom normalize surprise nixon implement farewell groundwork pioneer home hail today interview richest trust crucial extensive moderate cabinet find balance describe careful highlight navigate long hand big start intellectual diplomat accord mitigate japan security variety call celebrate agency side hostility tension tiger secret associate richard janet yi current establishment fallout allege scott tie highly aim china extraordinary influential dispatch signal pave trip split meeting shift contact plunge thursday cold learn quote feeling office apparent briefing view jinping open note wednesday outlet hawkish domestic university alfred month mixed secretary left populous diplomacy foreign formalize tank fly yew seek engagement difficult lay significance attempt practice finally central coverage kissinger controversial joe restore contribution balloon creative grant ahead wise policy country adviser school state hard require model place effort comment biden advocate president quietly kind person soviet strong belie legacy washington spy early relationship national work potential step life goodwill add official wang kerry formation february figure mourn yellen period topic travel mark told broadcaster advisor communication envoy living treasury ideological agree put business alarmed death reengagement minister relation trend friend purpose lee shock regular former moscow normalization covert climate pragmatism statesman refer consider glow communist half july breakthrough word remember world visit diplomatic deeply low positive public reality cctv ease professor beijing follow friendship decade displeasure communique selftaiwan xie avoid senior grow architect tectonic earlier held pragmatic value tougher engage deepen century strategic weibo alive gesture thousand recent key heart process fight study day wenbin singapore fracture golden top enlai premier stand tribute feng indelible,0.9974,0.2326182476092013,11.729046242774562,0.3692874532874534,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,"In undisclosed call, Pope Francis warned Israel against committing ‘terror’",2023-11-30 04:27:00,"Anthony Faiola, Stefano Pitrelli, Louisa Loveluck","As bombs fell and tanks penetrated deep into Gaza in late October, Israeli President Isaac Herzog held a fraught phone call with Pope Francis. The Israeli head of state was describing his nation’s horror over the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 when the pope issued a blunt rejoinder.It is “forbidden to respond to terror with terror,” Francis said, according to a senior Israeli official familiar with the call, which has not been previously reported.Herzog protested, repeating the position that the Israeli government was doing what was needed in Gaza to defend its own people. The pope continued, saying those responsible should indeed be held accountable, but not civilians.That private call would inform Israeli interpretations of Francis’s polemic statement, at his Nov. 22 general audience in St. Peter’s Square, that the conflict had “gone beyond war. This is terrorism.” Taken with the diplomatic exchange — deemed so “bad” by the Israelis that they did not make it public — the implication seemed clear: The pope was calling their campaign in Gaza an act of terrorism.“How else could it be interpreted?” said the senior official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.The Vatican declined to clarify whether the pope was publicly or privately describing Israeli actions in Gaza as “terrorism.” But in a statement to The Washington Post, it acknowledged a call between the pope and Herzog. “The phone call, like others in the same days, takes place in the context of the Holy Father’s efforts aimed at containing the gravity and scope of the conflict situation in the Holy Land,” the statement read.A spokesman in the Israeli president’s office declined an opportunity to comment, saying, “We are not inclined to make reference to private conversations.”But the public words from the pope have sparked an outcry from pro-Israel groups, such as the American Jewish Committee, and rekindled historical tensions between some Jewish leaders and the Vatican.In a sense, the pope’s comments crystallized growing global horror over the loss of civilian life in Gaza. More than 13,300 people have been killed there since Israel launched its military campaign in early October, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Francis seemed to react much as humanitarian groups and other world leaders had.Yet there is concern among some pro-Israel organizations that, even while the Vatican holds less moral sway than it once did, Francis has greater potential than most political leaders to influence global sentiment.“I think the risk is significant,” said Karma Ben Johanan, a scholar on Jewish-Christian relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “The pope does have, even in our semi-secular world, a moral stature, and his spiritual guidance is much appreciated. If the implication is that Israel has no right to defend itself, the risk is that this becomes a more popular opinion. It becomes more difficult for Jewish-Catholic relations.”On Nov. 22, in the hours before his general audience and “terrorism” comment, Francis held two emotional meetings: one with relatives of people killed in Gaza and the other with families of hostages taken by Hamas.In the session with the Palestinians, the pope wept as they spoke of the massive death toll, said Shireen Hilal, a professor who lost two family members. She and others in attendance said Francis used the word “genocide” in English.“He knew exactly what was happening, how hard it is to live in Gaza,” she said. “He knew all the circumstances. Knew there was no electricity, no gas, no fuel, no proper good water, no medical assistance. He also knew that the church is suffering in Gaza.”A Vatican spokesman told reporters that as far as he knew, the pope had not said “genocide,” but he did not categorically rule it out. The pope has regularly warned of the suffering in Gaza and called for more humanitarian aid and a lasting cease-fire. The Vatican says he has also maintained daily contact with a Catholic church in Gaza sheltering 700 Palestinians.The pope’s Jewish critics complain that more broadly, he has focused on the plight in Gaza, mentioning it frequently, without dedicating an equal sense of outrage to the loss of life in Israel — something Vatican officials deny. His critics also blame him for failing to specifically denounce comments they view as antisemitic from Egypt’s Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand imam of al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo, with whom Francis had developed warm relations.Alfonso Pedatzur Arbib, the chief rabbi of Milan, expressed dismay that the Vatican arranged to meet with Israelis and Palestinians on the same day, as if the Israelis were not entitled to “exclusive solidarity.” The Israeli families had pushed hard for a meeting, which came together only after difficult negotiations in which the Vatican sought to avoid sending a political message. The Israelis, however, continued to press, hoping the pope’s stature would aid their cause.After the encounter, they expressed gratitude, describing the pope as compassionate. Some, however, said they were disappointed by the brevity of the audience — less than 20 minutes — and that so few of them were able to speak.Some were also taken aback by Francis’s comments hours later, when he seemed to equate Israeli’s response in Gaza to terrorism.“In Rome, we felt he was with us, but in front of the world, it felt a bit different,” said Romi Cohen, 19, whose twin brother is being held hostage in Gaza. She added, “I personally feel that comparing the two sides when talking about terror is not something that [should] happen.”The pope’s comment set off a firestorm.“The pope, because he is the pope, has to measure his words,” said American Rabbi Abraham Cooper, director of global social action for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, who has met with Francis three times. “To show empathy for Palestinians who lost loved ones in Gaza is a decent thing to do. But what the pope was approaching, and I hope he didn’t get there, was to give a moral equivalency to the medieval butchery [of the Hamas attack] and the acts of a democratic country.”Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, president of the Italian Bishops’ Conference and a confidant of the pope, sought to reframe Francis’s remark.“This does not mean putting everyone on the same level,” Zuppi told reporters last week. “October 7th was a tragedy, full stop. It was a tragedy.”Still, the blowback continued. Critics questioned the pope for not explicitly condemning Hamas. Some Jewish leaders suggested Francis had a responsibility to not only stand up for Israel, but take a stand against an alarming rise in antisemitism.“What’s happening right now is a return to spite and demonization of the Jews,” Pedatzur Arbib said. “There are stunning polls saying most Italian students think Israel can be compared to Nazis. Something big is happening … all inhibitions are being forsaken. I’d expect an unambiguous action from the church, which I have yet to see.”Israeli officials — if not rabbis and Jewish groups — have held back from publicly denouncing the pope.The government has been quick to defend itself against other criticism of its military response. It has engaged in a war of words with U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, among others.The difference in the case of the pope is partly because the conversation with Herzog was confidential, Israeli insiders said. But the government may also worry that a public fight with Francis — with his potential to influence as many as 1.3 billion Catholics — could prove even more harmful than the terrorism remark.Even his harshest Jewish critics are not suggesting that Francis is trafficking in antisemitism, a scourge he has repeatedly denounced.As a cardinal in Buenos Aires — home to one of the world’s largest Jewish populations — Francis was known to celebrate Jewish holidays with locals, helping to light menorahs during Hanukkah.In 2015, he marked the 50th anniversary of Nostra Aetate — the Vatican II declaration that sought to remove Biblical-era blame for Jesus’s death on the Jewish people — with one of the strongest defenses of Israel by a sitting pope. “To attack Jews is antisemitism, but an outright attack on the State of Israel is also antisemitism,” he said.More than previous pontiffs, though, the first Latin American pope has also championed human rights, seeing the downtrodden, the underdogs and the oppressed as his primary cause. He reflects the Global South’s general distrust and skepticism of the West and its allies, as well as more sympathetic views toward Palestinians and Russia.It was in that context that Francis visited Bethlehem in 2014 and prayed alongside a West Bank separation barrier graffitied with the slogan “Free Palestine!”Francis has become even less cautious in the latter stage of his papacy, expressing himself in strong and candid terms. Last year, he suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin had invaded Ukraine in part because of “the barking of NATO at Russia’s door.” He recently decried a “strong reactionary attitude” among American Catholics — subsequently removing one critic, Texas Bishop Joseph Strickland, and stripping the traditional privileges of another, U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke.“These are apparently spontaneous throwaways that actually match his convictions,” said Marco Politi, a Francis biographer. “There can be blunders,” Politi said, like when the pope seemed to glorify Russia’s imperial past in unscripted remarks to Catholic youths in St. Petersburg. “But when he speaks of terror … it’s his take on how normal people talk, with easy words. Killing many thousands of people in Gaza is terrorism, that’s it.”",9780,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/30/pope-francis-israel-war-terrorism/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,implication suffer leader express nation fraught social equivalency traditional loss isaac significant south toll gravity apparently appreciate insider rome spark candid difference poll traffic clear dedicate back developed milan context reactionary outrage personally react accountable stature reframe imperial ukraine minute barrier conflict recently student government glorify late influence statement familiar hour ally russian time sympathetic confidential strickland maintain reference focus genocide partly youth zuppi arbib scope democratic interpret invade hilal alarm big message brother call privately francis previously emotional inform light match leo discus meet protest inclined lose aetate imam easy quick october indeed organization aim aback issue forbidden irish repeat putin attack continued deem measure happen forsaken question holy suggest texas matteo university father penetrate responsibility secretary billion strip expect tank ahmed joseph spiritual terrorism pope champion explicitly declaration alexander stop complain unambiguous medieval west harmful pedro private twin large effort raymond categorically campaign comment antónio daily sánchez worry strong gratitude send catholic front early popular potential critic dismay exchange scholar official romi director told square cardinal antisemitism underdog give live minister humanitarian distrust antisemitic remark crystallize prime risk fail visit herzog massive head varadkar different return slogan professor separation kill circumstance decent electricity avoid local nato compare marco defend group chief engage jesus hope response prayed scourge prove hostage demonization position spite horror warn bomb polemic politi speak situation cairo push attitude terror skepticism stage grand speaks conviction post opinion palestinian karma press acknowledge decry regularly abraham bit blunt gaza health american entitle make center condemn rise unscripted great assistance year israel reporter level military fuel equal act feel ministry part oppress exclusive spokesman political water clarify civilian wiesenthal latin spoke jerusalem mention hop home downtrodden outright equate brevity buenos interpretation describe alongside reflect inhibition accord responsible confidant family celebrate deny spontaneous side love sensitive tension sought israeli stun arrange medical denounce past encounter knew attendance land hamas italian approach set gas spanish meeting contact fell plight cooper petersburg talk deep office action view papacy jewish historical full croo session primary relative free anonymity belgian conference rule palestine population hebrew blowback shireen egypt negotiation difficult nazi mosque compassionate empathy outcry contain bethlehem phone launch marked state pedatzur hard holiday place broadly repeatedly president global specifically sheikh warm washington aire audience sway life add bank jew cautious conversation biographer privilege felt publicly hold blunder pontiff put death relation wept general aid remove normal committee criticism opportunity word world diplomatic latter public decline bishop show member vatican subsequently rekindle proper defense harshest previous cohen respond shelter johanan guterres case graffitied anniversary term senior grow church russia guidance week held concern tragedy simon thousand disappointed rabbi menorah throwaway frequently vladimir fight human day butchery condition stand blame barking,-0.99535,0.2760736196319018,9.71735930735931,0.3512419497713618,0,2023-11-30

Reuters,Sri Lanka and creditor nations agree in principle on debt restructuring,2023-11-29 13:00:00,"Uditha Jayasinghe, Tetsushi Kajimoto","COLOMBO/TOKYO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka and a group of its creditor nations said on Wednesday they have reached an agreement in principle on debt restructuring, a key step needed for the South Asian nation to emerge from its severe economic crunch.The deal will help Sri Lanka clear the first review of a bailout under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) executive board program by the year end, which would trigger a second IMF tranche of about $334 million.""This agreement serves as a key milestone in Sri Lanka's ongoing endeavour to achieve public debt sustainability and to foster economic recovery,"" said Sri Lanka's treasury secretary Mahinda Siriwardana.The small island nation, mired in its worst financial crisis in decades, has been trying to reach restructuring deals with creditors since last year after defaulting on its foreign debt in May 2022 due to record-low foreign exchange reserves.Sri Lanka's finance ministry said the agreement in principle covered approximately $5.9 billion of outstanding public debt and consisted of a mix of long-term maturity extension and reduction in interest rates.Japan co-chairs Sri Lanka's official creditor committee, together with France and India, which is comprised of 15 nations.

Once the debt restructuring is completed, Sri Lanka hopes to reduce its overall debt by $16.9 billion.""This is a key milestone for debt restructuring,"" said Udeeshan Jonas, chief strategist at equity research firm CAL Group.""The good news is that this activates the second IMF tranche and that also means ADB (Asian Development Bank) and other funding comes into place helping the government's borrowing requirements to come down.""""The next step will be for Sri Lanka to negotiate a deal with the sovereign bondholders,"" Jonas added.Sri Lanka's overseas bonds extended gains after the debt agreement was officially confirmed, with longer-dated notes rising as much as 1.6 cents on the dollar to just over 50 cents at 1213 GMT time, according to Tradeweb data.Sri Lanka's finance ministry said it would next focus on striking similar deals with other bilateral creditors for debt amounting to $274 million.It will also try to reach agreement with bondholders who hold the bulk of the island nation's $12.5 billion worth of international sovereign bonds.The debt restructuring proposal sent by private creditors in October did not receive a favourable response from Sri Lanka's finance ministry, which said it had ""serious reservations"" about the construct of proposed macro-linked bonds.Kanda said negotiations were ""on track"" with bilateral creditors and they were working on details of a memorandum of understanding. He declined to comment on details such as the interest rates that would be applied to the restructured debt, or the repayment period.The IMF did not immediately respond to request for comment.""These engagements will ensure that the overall debt treatment granted to Sri Lanka is consistent with the IMF program parameters,"" the official creditor committee said in a statement.",3639,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/creditor-nations-likely-agree-sri-lanka-debt-restructuring-report-2023-11-29/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,worth paris news international strike receive secretary billion bilateral formal achievement udeeshan foreign expect program adb nation nov endeavour data negotiation emerge cal engagement interest activates creditor south review board track ongoing overseas rise reservation grant monetary year milestone funding officially similar clear deal construct principle private large income comprise place ministry agreement formalise comment treatment masato understand island default tranche include small tradeweb serf june sri reduce work severe step firm approximately million exchange official rate bank government development memorandum request statement sustainability debt outstanding research cover favourable detail foster hold bond treasury time economic due france focus propose reach committee equity bailout describe strategist diplomat restructure extension accord gmt trigger japan complete apply ensure reduction requirement proposal restructuring financial amount executive major public parameter lead consist decline consistent member finance middle negotiate external decade bulk struck october problem respond case imf mix china cent asian mire club lanka join group chief kanda recovery hope response key borrowing confirm repayment crisis extend reuters achieve jonas bondholder maturity note wednesday mahinda top india dollar immediately sovereign fund,0.8798,0.1648804616652926,11.664024577572969,0.3286643026004728,0,2023-11-29

Reuters,Russia is preparing a 'loyalty agreement' requirement for foreigners,2023-11-29 10:55:00,"Guy Faulconbridge, Lidia Kelly","MOSCOW, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Russia's interior ministry has prepared draft legislation that would force foreigners to sign a ""loyalty agreement"" forbidding them from criticising official policy, discrediting Soviet military history, or contravening traditional family values.Since President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has introduced a slew of tough laws that outlaw discrediting the military, and courts have handed down long jail sentences to opposition activists.As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Putin has cast the war as part of an existential battle with the West, saying he will defend Russia's ""sacred"" civilisation from what he portrays as the West's decadence.The TASS state news agency reported on Wednesday that the draft legislation had been prepared by the interior ministry and would force all foreigners entering Russia to sign an agreement that essentially restricts what they can say in public.A foreigner entering Russia would be prohibited from ""interfering with the activities of public authorities of the Russian Federation, discrediting in any form the foreign and domestic state policy of the Russian Federation, public authorities and their officials"", TASS said.The proposed agreement would include clauses about morality, family, ""propaganda about non-traditional sexual relations"" and history.In particular, foreigners would be barred from ""distorting the historical truth about the feat of the Soviet people in the defence of the Fatherland and its contribution to the victory over fascism"".The Soviet Union is estimated to have lost at least 27 million people in World War Two and eventually pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin. Governments loyal to Moscow then took power across swathes of eastern Europe.It was not clear from Russian media reports which foreigners the draft legislation - if it becomes law - would apply to or what the punishment would be for not adhering to the ""agreement"" which foreigners would have to sign upon entry to Russia.The Kremlin declined to comment on the initiative.Opposition activists and foreign diplomats in Moscow have for months been warning that the authorities are toughening their stance on any dissent ahead of the presidential election.The Kremlin said earlier this month that some measure of censorship was needed as Russian troops were fighting in Ukraine, and cautioned those who wanted to criticise the military to think carefully before they did.For the draft to become law, it has to be introduced to the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, and to go through committee review and several readings before being submitted to Putin for signing.The chairman of the Duma's CIS Affairs Committee said that the draft law was well advanced and was being worked on by the interior ministry, the government, the presidential administration as well as his committee.""The draft law on the so-called 'loyalty agreement' with migrants entering the Russian Federation is in a high degree of readiness,"" Leonid Kalashnikov told Interfax.Kalashnikov said some details of the proposed law were still to be worked out. The interior ministry did not immediately respond to requests for a comment.The law has not yet been introduced formally in parliament, according to Reuters searches of the Duma's database.Since the start of its war in Ukraine, Russia has imposed a number of restrictions on foreigners from what it calls ""unfriendly countries"" - meaning those that have imposed sanctions on it over its war in Ukraine.",3544,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/draft-bill-seeks-loyalty-agreement-foreigners-entering-russia-2023-11-29/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,news forbid immediately month legislation activity foreign essentially dissent federation interior nov contravene tough high nazi traditional draft bar union berlin administration defence review chairman contribution ahead sign policy country force opposition west existential military eventually clear back carefully state prepared medium eastern ministry agreement comment president part order soviet sentence include ukraine sacred feat affair stance morality work battle interfere million power leonid official impose house discredit government february request history told adhere prohibit form detail propaganda russian victory election readiness punishment loyalty outlaw relation propose number cast unfriendly enter moscow estimate committee toughen clause caution sanction introduce diplomat start hand long accord fatherland apply family court jail parliament portrays world call sexual foreigner agency public authority low decline migrant meaning law criticise slew report lose restriction censorship respond distort kremlin truth swathe russia earlier submit kalashnikov approach defend particular putin advanced search loyal vladimir measure fascism activist reading restricts fight warn troop civilisation reuters formally wednesday historical degree entry domestic duma push presidential,-0.76535,0.0,13.716850921273023,0.2774652777777777,0,2023-11-29
USA TODAY,US military aircraft crashes into the sea off southern Japan,2023-11-29 09:34:49,not specified,"TOKYO (AP) — A crew member who was recovered from the ocean after a U.S. military Osprey aircraft carrying six people crashed Wednesday off southern Japan has been pronounced dead, coast guard officials said. The cause of the crash and the status of the five others on the aircraft were not immediately known, coast guard spokesperson Kazuo Ogawa said. Initial reports said the aircraft was carrying eight people, but the U.S. military later revised the number to six, he said. The coast guard received an emergency call from a fishing boat near the crash site off Yakushima, an island south of Kagoshima on the southern main island of Kyushu, he said. Coast guard aircraft and patrol boats found one person, who was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, and gray-colored debris believed to be from the aircraft, Ogawa said. They were found about 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) off the eastern coast of Yakushima. An empty inflatable life raft was also found in the area. “The government will confirm information about the damage and place the highest priority on saving lives,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters. The Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter, but during flight can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much faster like an airplane. Versions of the aircraft are flown by the U.S. Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force. Ogawa said the aircraft had departed from the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi prefecture and crashed on its way to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa. Japanese Vice Defense Minister Hiroyuki Miyazawa said the Osprey had attempted an emergency sea landing. Kyodo News agency, quoting Kagoshima prefectural officials, said witnesses reported seeing fire coming from the Osprey’s left engine. It said a Japanese military base in Saga in southern Japan decided to postpone planned Osprey flight exercises on Thursday. U.S. and Japanese officials said the aircraft belonged to Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo. U.S. Air Force officials at Yokota said they were still confirming information and had no immediate comment. Ospreys have had a number of accidents in the past, including in Japan, where they are deployed at both U.S. and Japanese military bases. In Okinawa, where about half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan are based, Gov. Denny Tamaki told reporters Wednesday that he will ask the U.S. military to suspend all Osprey flights in Japan. In December 2016, a U.S. Marine Corps Osprey crashed off the Okinawa coast, injuring two of the five crew members and triggering complaints among local residents about the U.S. bases and the Osprey's safety record. A U.S. Marine Corps Osprey with 23 Marines aboard crashed on a north Australian island in August, killing at least three and critically injuring at least five during a multinational training exercise. It was the fifth fatal crash of a Marine Osprey since 2012, bringing the death toll at that time to at least 19.",2973,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/11/29/us-military-osprey-crash-off-southern-japan/71738009007/,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bring news saga helicopter version station information japanese receive secretary left rotate belong high critically emergency okinawa yamaguchi immediate hospital australian south attempt toll american airplane patrol vice december multinational depart believe denny engine forward recover reporter force deployed military ogawa fishing safety miyazawa place eastern comment dead witness fatal coast island person include kazuo boat base life site north training official tamaki government revise told guard yokota debris western flown damage tokyo carry status crashed kadena time death postpone minister spokesperson plan yakushima matsuno cabinet prefectural decide japan pronounce accident iwakuni half trigger complaint kyushu ocean prefecture call aboard hybrid agency nearby cruise member kagoshima report mile injure navy raft defense kill hirokazu resident aircraft save crash corp past southern suspend hiroyuki land local priority faster chief air inflatable august marine osprey empty confirm area quote thursday found fire propeller troop kyodo kilometer gov exercise crew wednesday initial flight record number immediately,-0.98885,0.201816347124117,9.736556776556776,0.2328571428571428,0,2023-11-29

New York Times,Israel-Hamas WarTalks in Qatar Focus on Extending Truce as Deadline Looms,2023-11-29 08:52:00,"Ben Hubbard, Elena Shao, Lazaro Gamio, Katherine Rosman, Shawn Paik, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Roni Rabin, Alan Yuhas","An aunt of Avigail Idan talks about the 4-year-old’s time in captivity.Gazans try to stock up on essentials while the truce holds.Freed hostages are experiencing emotional swings, families say.Israel says Hamas is holding the remains of three soldiers killed during the Oct. 7 attacks.International mediators were scrambling on Wednesday to lock in another temporary extension of the cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, seeing it as the best way to ease the embattled territory’s humanitarian crisis, secure the release of more Israeli captives from Gaza and slow the war’s rocketing death toll for at least a little longer.But officials with knowledge of the talks said they also hoped that the succession of short-term pauses would pave the way toward a larger goal: negotiations over a longer-term cease-fire to bring the war to a close.Achieving that is no easy task. Israeli officials have vowed not to stop their military campaign until Hamas’s leadership has been eliminated and the group’s military and governance infrastructure is uprooted from Gaza, objectives that remain far off. And the arrangement that has underpinned the cease-fire so far — the release of hostages from Gaza, nearly all of them women and children, in exchange for the discharge of Palestinians from Israeli prisons and the entry of more aid into Gaza — is likely to become much trickier when the parties begin negotiating to exchange captured combatants.Hamas is believed to have captured a few dozen Israeli soldiers during the rampage it led through southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people and saw some 240 dragged into Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli officials. And Israel holds many high-profile Palestinian prisoners, including prominent members of Hamas convicted of grave crimes whose release the group has promised to pursue.As of Tuesday, Hamas had released at least 85 hostages from Gaza, according to a New York Times tally, and Israel had released 180 Palestinians from its prisons.With the cease-fire scheduled to expire on Thursday morning, top officials from Qatar, the United States, Egypt and Israel were meeting in Qatar in talks that were focused on extending it to allow for further exchanges. That formula has succeeded in mostly pausing the war since Friday. Each day, Israelis have watched groups of their hostages return home while Palestinians have seen their detainees released from jail, intense emotional events for each side.The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, who was scheduled to travel to Israel on Thursday, said the Biden administration wants the truce to continue because it “means that more hostages will be coming home, more assistance will be getting in.”“Clearly, that’s something we want,” Mr. Blinken told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. “I believe it’s also something that Israel wants. They’re also intensely focused on bringing their people home.”Speaking on condition of anonymity, an Israeli official said the country would consider further pauses as long as Hamas keeps releasing hostages.But two people with knowledge of the talks in Qatar said that beyond yet another short-term extension, the mediators hoped to keep the war on pause for as long as possible to create conditions they hoped would allow for negotiations over a longer-term cease-fire.One of those sources said the mediators expect that the longer the quiet lasts, the harder it will be for Israel to restart its offensive and extend it to southern Gaza, where senior Hamas leaders are believed to be hiding.The talks have gained even more urgency because of the death toll and spiraling humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel’s bombardment of the territory and subsequent ground invasion have leveled entire neighborhoods and killed more than 13,000 people, according to heath authorities in Gaza. More than half of the territory’s 2.2 million Palestinians have been displaced, and the destruction means that many will have no homes to return to after the war ends.On Wednesday, President Biden appeared to couch his otherwise strong embrace of Israel by suggesting that more fighting would benefit Hamas.“Hamas unleashed a terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace,” Mr. Biden said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “To continue down the path of terror, violence, killing and war is to give Hamas what they seek. We can’t do that.”Patrick Kingsley contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Michael Crowley from Brussels.— Ben Hubbard reporting from IstanbulHamas released 10 Israeli hostages and two Thai nationals on Tuesday as the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas continued into a fifth day, raising the total number of captives released to 85. Roughly 240 hostages were captured on Oct. 7, when Hamas led devastating raids into Israel and killed about 1,200 people, according to the Israeli authorities.Age groupSTILL HELD HOSTAGEReleasedUnder 185 and under63018 to 549936Died in captivity55 and older291980 and overAge groupSTILL HELD HOSTAGEReleasedUnder 186305 and under18 to 549936Died in captivity55 and older291980 and overNote: The number of hostages held in captivity is an undercount; identities and ages could not be confirmed for roughly 20 captives. Some foreign nationals’ ages are not known; if they were known to be in Israel as guest workers, they are represented in the 18-to-54 age group. The number of freed hostages does not include one person in the 18-to-54 age group who was rescued by Israeli forces.Sources: Israeli prime minister's office, New York Times reporting, HaaretzTuesday’s release followed the return of 11 Israelis on Monday, 13 on Sunday, 13 on Saturday and 13 on Friday, nearly all of them women or children. Seventeen Thais, one Filipino and one Russian-Israeli dual citizen were also released through separate negotiations. Four other hostages were released before the cease-fire.Israel has freed 180 imprisoned Palestinians — roughly three for every Israeli hostage released — in exchange for the release of the hostages.At least four hostages have died in captivity, according to Israel and Hamas. Israeli officials said that three — a 19-year-old soldier, Noa Marciano; Yehudit Weiss, 65; and Ravid Katz, 51 — were killed by their captors. Arye Zalmanovich, 86, died after suffering a heart attack, Hamas has said.Israel and Hamas agreed on Monday to extend their truce to six days — through at least Wednesday — to allow for the release of more Israeli hostages and imprisoned Palestinians, and for more humanitarian aid to flow into the Gaza Strip, where thousands of Gazans have been killed and conditions for the living have deteriorated to the point of catastrophe.Since the cease-fire began, Israel has continued its escalation of nighttime raids in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, arresting at least 71 more Palestinians since Nov. 24, according to the Israeli military. The Palestinian Authority’s commission for prisoner affairs put the number of those arrested at 112 or more, including women, children and older people.— Elena Shao and Lazaro GamioHalf of all buildings in northern Gaza are damaged or destroyed, according to satellite analysis estimates.An aunt of Avigail Idan, the girl who was taken hostage by Hamas after she saw her parents brutally killed and who turned 4 a few days before being released, says that her niece shared one piece of pita bread per day with four others, and did not have a shower or bath during her 50 days in captivity.Avigail, who is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States, was kept with the four members of the Brodutch family with whom she was kidnapped on Oct. 7. The Brodutches were the Idan family’s neighbors at the Kfar Aza kibbutz, and Avigail had hidden with the family after her parents were shot.According to the aunt, Tal Idan, the five hostages were kept in aboveground apartments, changing locations at least once. They were given a piece of pita with za’atar, a Middle Eastern spice mixture, each day to share.While in captivity, Avigail’s hair was cut because she had developed a significant case of lice, Ms. Idan said in an interview this week. “She was covered in it. It took quite an effort to help her get rid of some of it the first night,” she said.“It was lovely curly hair. And now it’s all gone. But it will grow again.”When Avigail was released on Sunday, she was met at the border in Israel by her grandmother and an aunt. A military helicopter took them to a pediatric hospital near Tel Aviv. The military gave her a set of small, pink noise-canceling headphones to put over her ears.Avigail’s family was relieved to learn that she was not alone during her captivity, and was looked after by Hagar Brodutch as she also cared for her own three children. “We are so grateful for Hagar,,” Ms. Idan said, calling the 40-year-old “our guardian angel.”Since the Oct. 7 attacks, Ms. Idan and her husband have helped care for Avigail’s siblings, Michael, 9, and Amelia, 6, who were not kidnapped. Now, she said, the children must adjust to a life without their parents.“For all three of them, the focus is helping them get a new life — being able to feel safe again and being able to sleep for the entire night and not having nightmares,” she said.— Katherine RosmanGazans Wait in Long Lines for Supplies During Brief Cease-FireGazans have been out on the streets during the temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to stock up on supplies. Long lines snaked out of gas stations in Khan Younis this week, while merchants in Gaza City set up food stalls amid piles of rubble. But residents say the wait is long and many goods are in short supply.— Shawn PaikHostages freed by Hamas are experiencing bursts of euphoria followed by emotional crashes as they emerge from weeks of paralyzing fear in captivity, according to Israeli relatives who spoke to journalists at the Israeli Embassy in London on Tuesday.“Everything is just so fragile,” said Limor Sella-Broyde, 40, whose cousins Judith Raanan, 59, and Natalie Raanan, 17, were freed on Oct. 20.She said the mother and daughter were in difficult psychological states as they recovered. “It’s an adrenaline rush and then a crash,” Ms. Sella-Broyde said. “They try to speak and then they get really tired.”Three of Ms. Sella-Broyde’s relatives were killed by Hamas during the group’s terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, while seven others were taken hostage from Kibbutz Be’eri.Judith and Natalie Raanan, who are dual citizens of Israel and the United States, were the first hostages to be freed from captivity after negotiations involving the United States, Qatar and other nations. But for their family, any sense of relief remains out of reach because so many other members remain captive, and because the life they knew in the kibbutz has been shattered.Ms. Sella-Broyde was part of a small group of Israelis brought to London this week to speak about their experiences related to the Oct. 7 attacks and to raise the profiles of the many other hostages who remain in captivity.The event, sponsored by an Israeli charity, appeared designed in part to refocus public attention on Oct. 7, at a time when much of that attention has shifted to Israeli airstrikes and military operations in Gaza that have caused thousands of civilian deaths.But the Israelis who spoke on Tuesday were reluctant to give details of the ordeals their family members had gone through in Gaza or describe their medical conditions after being released, citing a desire to protect their privacy.Ms. Sella-Broyde said that she was nervous about broaching difficult topics with Judith and Natalie Raanan. “They are broken,” she said.Another member of the group who spoke, Shahar Mor, 52, said that four of his family members had been kidnapped on Oct. 7. Three of them, including Ohad Munder Zichri, 9, have since been released, but the family’s patriarch, Avraham Munder, 78, has not.Mr. Mor said that when his relatives were first freed, the family members simply hugged one another. But he added that he was dogged by a feeling of horror at the events of Oct. 7 and by worry for Mr. Munder.In captivity, Mr. Mor said, his relatives had subsisted mainly on pita bread, which became more scarce as the weeks went by, and they ate with their guards. One guard gave them a pack of cards, which helped to pass the time, he said.Mr. Mor downplayed the significance of the gesture, arguing that one humane act by a Hamas guard should not be a distraction from the group’s ruthlessness.“Some of the captors are nicer; some are less nice,” he said. “It makes no difference.”— Matthew Mpoke BiggIsrael confirmed on Tuesday the deaths of three Israeli soldiers who fell in combat during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, and a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces press office, Nir Dinar, said Hamas was holding some of their remains.The Israeli army identified the three soldiers as Sgt. Shaked Dahan, 19, of Afula, in northern Israel; Sgt. Kiril Brodski, 19, of Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv; and Staff Sgt. Tomer Yaakov Ahimas, 20, from Lehavim, a town in southern Israel. The military ranks of all three soldiers had been upgraded after their deaths.The army’s chief rabbi made a determination the soldiers had been killed during the Hamas-led attacks in which 1,200 people were massacred, based on evidence and intelligence reports, according to ynet.com, an Israeli news site.Military funerals will be held on Wednesday for two of the soldiers, Sergeant Ahimas and Sergeant Brodski, ynet.com reported, suggesting enough remains were recovered and identified for funerals to be held for them under Jewish tradition.Sigalit Gal, the mother of Sergeant Dahan, said in a Facebook post that she would not start the weeklong Jewish mourning ritual of Shiva for her son until his body was returned. “I fought all my life to take care and raise you with love, excellent education, values, a proper environment,” she wrote. “You were taken from me forever. They took you and did not care to return you — not even your body.”It was not immediately clear why the army press office made the announcement on Tuesday, or whether the announcement might indicate that the soldiers’ bodies would be linked to the release of further Israeli hostages from Gaza.Israel has in the past been willing to pay dearly in order to return bodies of its fallen soldiers to their families for burial, often releasing large numbers of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for bodies. In 2008, for example, Israel released five prisoners, including a Lebanese man convicted of murder, in order to obtain the bodies of two fallen Israeli soldiers.— Roni RabinUnder pressure from allies to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as it welcomes Israeli hostages home under the terms of a fragile cease-fire, Israel faces an increasingly difficult set of decisions about the future of its war against Hamas.Israeli leaders have vowed to eliminate Hamas, the group that has controlled Gaza since 2007 and that led devastating attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. They have also promised to recover all of the roughly 240 people who were kidnapped by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups that day.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cited the recovery of hostages in justifying his support for the pause in Israel’s ground invasion — and has also said that Israel’s military is ready to resume fighting once the cease-fire arrangement ends.But the deal also gives Hamas time to regroup and retrench, making Israel’s objective of rooting it out more difficult. And Israel’s release of Palestinians from imprisonment or detention under the arrangement has been accompanied by growing support for Hamas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.The extended cease-fire has also allowed aid to reach more of Gaza’s 2.2 million residents, most of whom have been displaced by the fighting and face dire shortages of food, medicine and fuel.Israel and Hamas have extended their brief truce from four to six days, according to Qatar, which has been mediating their talks. The agreement has so far held, despite accusations by each side that the other had violated it.Since Friday, Hamas has released at least 60 Israeli hostages and Israel has freed 180 imprisoned Palestinians. Nineteen other hostages in Gaza — 17 Thais, one Filipino and one Russian-Israeli dual citizen — have been released since Friday through separate negotiations.Before the cease-fire agreement took hold on Friday, Israel’s military had bombarded the Gaza Strip for weeks, saying it had struck over 15,000 targets. The bombardment included the use of very large weapons in dense urban areas, and Palestinian health authorities in the Hamas government have said that more than 13,000 people have been killed, including thousands of children. The bombardment, the large number of deaths and the displacement of the majority of Gaza’s 2.2 million people have fueled international outcry over the scope of Israel’s campaign.Israel has said it is targeting Hamas all over Gaza, including in places where its members are embedded among civilians, like hospitals and shelters, and in an extensive tunnel network underground.Early in the war, the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza, ahead of a ground invasion. More than a million people fled south, and the invasion began in late October.Israeli troops have captured a swath of northern Gaza roughly in the shape of a C: the northern edge of the strip, a sliver along the Mediterranean coast, and the central strip below Gaza City. The forces largely encircled Gaza City and split the strip in two halves, seeking to disrupt Hamas’s grip over the enclave and begin ousting it from its biggest city. But there appear to be parts of northern Gaza that the Israeli military does not control.Israeli forces have also closed in on Gaza’s hospitals, seizing Al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest and most modern. Israel said Hamas used tunnels beneath the hospital as a command center, accusations the group and hospital staff denied.The Israeli military has since sought to show evidence of its assertions, releasing videos that show parts of a tunnel shaft on the grounds of the Shifa complex, and rooms within the tunnel. But Israeli troops have moved slowly, wary of explosives and traps.The military has said it has destroyed some Hamas tunnels, but has not said that its troops have been fighting inside them.Ron Dermer, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, told Sky News on Nov. 7 that the Israeli military had killed “several thousand” Hamas fighters since the war began. He said that the total at that point was greater than 3,000 and “probably close to 4,000 already.” Israeli officials estimate that Hamas had numbered about 25,000 members before the war began.More than 70 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ground invasion began, according to the Israeli military.Hamas has acknowledged the deaths of several commanders in the war, including at least one senior figure. A number of other Hamas officials and commanders are believed to have been killed. Yahya Sinwar, the hard-line leader of Hamas in Gaza, remains a top target of Israeli forces.Israeli leaders have said they do not want to reoccupy Gaza after the war, and it remains unclear how or whether they can eliminate Hamas completely from the strip. And in the West Bank, which the Israeli military occupies, support for Hamas has grown amid the recent releases of Palestinians and mounting frustration with the Palestinian Authority, which oversees the West Bank.The political leadership of Hamas is not within Israel’s reach.

CNN,Australian police officer charged with manslaughter over death of 95-year-old woman tasered in nursing home,2023-11-29 08:25:00,Lianne Kolirin,"An Australian police officer has been charged with manslaughter after he tasered a 95-year-old woman with dementia in a nursing home.Clare Nowland, a great-grandmother, died in hospital a week after she was tasered at the home in May.Police had been called out to the home in Cooma, New South Wales by care staff who reported that a resident was armed with a knife. A 33-year-old senior constable, Kristian White, is alleged to have tasered Nowland at the home after asking her to drop a steak knife she was holding.Nowland, who had a walking aid, fell and hit her head, fracturing her skull.White, who has since been suspended from his role with pay, was initially charged with multiple offenses including recklessly causing grievous bodily harm and assault.In a statement published online on Wednesday, New South Wales Police said: “Following advice from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad have today laid an additional charge of Manslaughter against a 33-year-old Senior Constable attached to the Monaro Police District.”According to CNN affiliate Sky News Australia, when staff at the nursing home tried to coax Nowland into handing over the knives she was holding, she threw one at them.When White and another officer found her, accompanied by ambulance staff, she was in a room holding one of the knives, according to court documents cited by the broadcaster. The other officer attempted to grab the knife, but Nowland is said to have moved towards them with her walker.White then allegedly pulled out and activated his taser, telling the victim: “Clare, stop now, see this, this is a taser, drop it now, drop it, this is your first warning.”She then raised the hand holding the knife to chest height, according to the court documents, and he struck her with the taser in the chest area, causing her to fall and hit her head, still holding her walker.Family friend Andrew Thaler said at the time that before the incident Nowland was frail and unable to stand unaided. She weighed just 43 kilograms (95 pounds) and was 5-foot-2 (1.58 meters) tall and was suffering from dementia.White, who is due to appear in court on December 6, remains suspended from the force with pay, and has yet to enter a plea.",2260,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/australia/police-manslaughter-tasered-nursing-scli-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dementia knife news suffer coax attach kristian arm taser allegedly cooma hospital australian south attempt pound chest stop tall role december steak recklessly homicide victim bodily force state advice remains crime squad initially include monaro raise affiliate tasered andrew statement director hit threw broadcaster kilogram meter nowland laid frail pull activate constable police hold woman time online walk due charge home sky friend today officer aid unable enter cnn nursing grievous room hand accord accompany court call publish public move thaler head prosecution report follow ambulance additional allege resident struck manslaughter senior suspend weigh incident week white unaided harm drop multiple document fell height area pay found office australia staff fracture plea wednesday fall command stand clare offense grab,-0.9681,0.1327433628318584,9.792616822429904,0.2227272727272727,0,2023-11-29
ABC,"Mali's governmnet to probe ethnic rebel leaders, suggesting collapse of crucial 2015 peace deal",2023-11-29 08:07:00,BABA AHMED Associated Press,"BAMAKO, Mali -- Mali's military government announced an investigation into ethnic rebel leaders who signed a peace agreement in 2015 to halt their quest for an independent state, a development experts said shows the crucial deal has collapsed.The public prosecutor at the Bamako Court of Appeal ordered Tuesday night the probe into the Tuareg rebellion leaders who have accused the government of not complying with the agreement and attacked security forces in recent months, driving them out of northern Mali in an attempt to create the state of Azawad— which they call home.The government in turn has referred to the rebels as a “terrorist group.”In a televised written statement, the public prosecutor stated a division “specialized in fighting terrorism and transnational organized crime was to start an investigation against terrorist leaders” who signed the agreement eight years ago.Key leaders of the Tuareg rebellion were named in the statement; Alghabass Ag Intalla and Bilal Ag Acherif, as well as leaders of the al-Qaeda-linked JNIM group, Iyad Ag Ghaly and Amadou Koufa.For the last couple of months, some of the rebels have been abandoning the agreement, signaling a rise in tension between them and Mali’s junta.Analysts have in the past warned that the fragile peace agreement — that had slowed violence over the years in the troubled region — may crumble.“We can effectively say that the 2015 peace agreement has collapsed,” said Shaantanu Shankar, Country Analyst for Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit“The Malian junta is facing serious problems with Jihadi terrorism on one front and at the same time trying to fight an armed political movement and the rebels in the north, so the junta is overstretched,"" he said.Mali’s military recently seized control of the northern town of Kidal, dominated by the rebels for nearly a decade.The military will focus on sustaining stability in the town as well as central and southern Mali which play a crucial role in the nation's economy, said Shankar.In 2015, the Tuareg rebel groups signed a peace deal with the government after other armed groups did, putting a halt to the fighting. The deal, at the time, was wleocmed by the United Nations.The Tuareg rebellion in Mali’s far north has been a source of conflict for decades.—",2294,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/malis-governmnet-probe-ethnic-rebel-leaders-suggesting-collapse-105237002,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,leader month organize couple arm region nation source ethnic terrorism tuareg night kidal announce peace attempt rebel united central role fragile rise sign mali country year malian force military africa state televise crime deal collapse agreement bamako halt turn order northern analyst overstretch front economy political dominate conflict recently north government investigation development expert wleocmed statement junta town violence movement specialized terrorist time shankar unit alghabass put ghaly focus seize drive jihadi crucial appeal division prosecutor refer start ag security court intelligence call comply public bilal show jnim troubled tension intalla rebellion play shaantanu tuesday effectively problem past southern probe acherif control iyad signal slow independent group transnational attack recent quest stability fight accuse warn create sustain abandon economist write amadou,-0.8602000000000001,0.0,11.66292682926829,0.3735507246376811,0,2023-11-29

CNN,Indigenous community in Ecuador wins legal fight to reclaim ancestral land after more than 80 years,2023-11-29 07:35:00,not specified,"An indigenous community has won a court battle to regain ownership over its ancestral homeland in the Ecuadorian Amazon, more than 80 years after they were displaced because of war.An Ecuadorian appeals court backed the Siekopai nation’s claim over Pë’këya, a biodiverse territory in northeast Ecuador along the border with Peru, according to a court ruling provided to CNN by Amazon Frontline, a nonprofit organization working with indigenous people to defend their land rights.The Siekopai were displaced during the Peru-Ecuador war in the 1940s.Last September, the community, which has only about 800 members, filed a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian state, claiming it was violating their right to ancestral property, Amazon Frontline said.In its ruling on Friday, the Provincial Court of Sucumbios gave Ecuador’s Ministry of Environment 45 days to deliver a property title to the Siekopai people for more than 104,000 acres of land, court documents show.“This is a historic moment for the Siekopai Nation,” said Elias Piyahuaje, President of the Siekopai Nation of Ecuador. “The land of Pë’këya has always been and will always be ours. For over 80 years, we have been fighting to get our land back.”The ruling “will mark the first time that the Ecuadorian government delivers a land title to an indigenous community whose ancestral territory is found in a protected area,” Amazon Frontline said, adding it “sets an invaluable precedent for all indigenous peoples fighting to recover their lands across Latin America and the world.”Piyahuaje said: “We are fighting for the preservation of our culture on this planet.

CNN,Dutch version of controversial book on British royal family taken off shelves in Netherlands,2023-11-29 06:49:00,Jack Guy,"A new book on the British royal family has been pulled from shops in the Netherlands amid reports that a translation error revealed the identity of a family member embroiled in a race row over Prince Harry and Meghan’s first child.“Endgame,” or “Eindstrijd” in Dutch, the latest book from British writer Omid Scobie was released this week.The Dutch translation was published in the Netherlands by Xander Uitgevers, which said it was “temporarily withdrawing” the book from sale in a statement on its website Tuesday.“An error occurred in the Dutch translation and is currently being rectified,” adds the statement.The Dutch translation reportedly revealed the name of a member of the royal family alleged to have questioned the skin color of Prince Harry and Meghan’s son Archie before he was born, according to PA Media.In March 2021, the Duchess of Sussex revealed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that husband Harry told her that there was concern within the royal family about her baby’s skin tone.There were several “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,” she said.“That was relayed to me from Harry.

CNN,The world’s strongest material could be used to make clean drinking water,2023-11-29 05:59:00,Rebecca Cairns,"Often referred to as a “miracle material,” graphene is one million times thinner than a single human hair and stronger than steel.The two-dimensional carbon material, made from single layers of graphite, a material mined from the ground, is extremely lightweight, conductive, and flexible, and has the potential to deliver transformational technologies across industries, from electronics to transportation.Now, researchers at Khalifa University in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are exploring another use for graphene: producing drinking water.“Here in the United Arab Emirates, all of our potable water is actually desalinated water, so it’s a very critical sector of the economy as well as society,” says Hassan Arafat, senior director of the university’s Research & Innovation Center for Graphene and 2D Materials (RIC2D).Desalination is the process of removing salt from seawater, and cleaning the water to make it drinkable. It isn’t just vital in the UAE: more than 300 million people globally rely on desalinated water. And as climate change and pollution threaten our limited fresh water supplies, that number will increase.But desalination is a costly and energy-intensive process.That’s where graphene comes in: Arafat is working on a graphene-enhanced membrane that could make the process more efficient and cheaper.“This year, we have seen a massive number of calamities due to climate change,” says Arafat. “Water shortage is a global problem, and it’s becoming worse by the day. Knowing that we are contributing to the solution of these problems is very fulfilling.”RIC2D was established in 2022 at Khalifa University, with investment from the government of Abu Dhabi, to further research into graphene innovations and its production.While Arafat’s role as senior director gives him an overview of many projects, his own research is focused on water.Arafat says that graphene can extend a membrane’s life by preventing “fouling,” which happens when bacteria accumulate on the filter and degrade the quality. Using graphene to “enhance the performance” of filters could help reduce energy usage and cut costs for desalination, says Arafat.“Even in small quantities, these graphene materials significantly improve the performance of the membranes in terms of their water production,” he adds.Currently in the development phase, the membranes will be produced and scaled up next year at the UK’s University of Manchester, RIC2D’s partner in graphene research, says Arafat. After that, the membranes will be tested in a desalination plant.Arafat isn’t the only one looking into graphene as a solution for desalination — startups like Watercycle Technologies are developing graphene-enhanced membranes to remove specific minerals from water, while Molymem is focused on dye removal — but Arafat claims that RIC2D’s membrane “out-performs” similar water filters in recent academic literature, and the partnership with the University of Manchester allows them to scale the technology for industrial testing.RIC2D is also exploring other applications for graphene such as sustainable construction materials with the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and renewable hydrogen energy solutions.Despite its transformational potential, graphene has proven difficult and expensive to produce at scale.One way to make it is by removing single layers from graphite, which has restricted its impact on mass-market solutions. However, researchers at RIC2D are working on ways to cut costs and time “without compromising the quality,” says Arafat.Another production method uses plasma chemistry to extract carbon from gases such as methane — a greenhouse gas made up of carbon and hydrogen — that are by-products of the oil and gas industry.The UAE is one of the top oil producers globally, and around 30% of the nation’s GDP comes from hydrocarbons. However, the UAE is eager to diversify its economy and is aiming for zero emissions by 2050.Graphene could help with both ambitions.RIC2D collaborated with UK startup Levidian, which developed its own plasma chemistry process to extract carbon from methane.By leveraging the UAE’s supply chain, there is a “great opportunity to accelerate the adoption of graphene in support of climate change,” says James Baker, CEO of Graphene@Manchester, the graphene innovation center at the University of Manchester, which partnered with Khalifa University to establish the RIC2D lab in 2022.Any carbon-based material — including waste from the oil and gas industry, or petroleum products like car tires — could be “effectively recycled or reused” to create chemically manufactured graphene, says Baker. “(There’s) a lot of interest in the UAE around the supply chain of producing graphene, and we’re working to really scale up production of this material from grams to kilograms to tons.”There’s an added benefit in producing graphene from a gas like methane: the hydrogen extracted can be used as a fuel, says Baker. He adds that graphene-composite materials could also be used to store hydrogen in stronger pressure vessels.“You’re not only de-carbonizing the waste, you’re using it, rather than putting it to a landfill or burning in it,” Baker adds.At the Graphene Flagship Week in September, an initiative funded by the European Union, RIC2D showcased multiple projects that are already on their way to commercialization, including a collaboration with French company Grapheal, which makes graphene-based biosensors, and a partnership with Turkish company NanoGrafen, which explores how to convert waste materials such as used tires into graphene products for composite construction materials.However, “the more novel and groundbreaking and life-changing the idea is, the longer the path is to be is likely to be to its final commercialization,” says Arafat.Arafat hopes that his research can have an impact in the Emirates and beyond. “While we’re starting locally, we’re certainly thinking globally,” he says.",5963,https://www.cnn.com/world/graphene-abu-dhabi-hnk-spc-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,partner company improve pollution ceo nation contribute project turkish technology leverage union united final role dioxide make center literature great year initiative expensive fuel industrial developed industry researcher potable explore grapheal renewable include small path economy reduce ground burning water thinner million change hassan government gram accumulate development efficient drinking waste commercialization recycle salt removal chemically time due innovation costly manchester focus dye composite abu nanografen sustainable extract degrade flexible start lightweight threaten producer membrane french foul impact society claim method construction manufacture aim uae partnership showcased single convert reuse transformational overview energy globally gas eager idea drinkable emission academic extend levidian quantity molymem calamity university shortage number specific diversify hair graphite sector methane longer european seawater scale gdp hydrocarbon cut startup desalinate produce oil difficult interest fresh pressure accelerate cost rely groundbreaking vital solution performance similar explores petroleum limited graphene compromise global strong watercycle biosensors extremely collaboration work potential life add filter director electronics layer research kilogram usage adoption collaborate arafat baker give put production cleaning phase remove james climate hydrogen desalination zero refer test opportunity tire investment chemistry landfill product locally massive application car greenhouse store benefit plasma lot effectively quality develop khalifa problem arab term significantly senior critical conductive week deliver establish restrict prevent uk multiple bacteria september hope emirate recent process supply human day dhabi create flagship miracle support chain lab top carbon mineral material proven fund enhance,0.98745,0.1006204930404159,11.914576271186435,0.4460829493087558,0,2023-11-29

Hazem Bader/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Newly freed Palestinian prisoner Lamees Abu Arqub kisses her father after Palestinians were freed from Israeli jails in exchange for Hamas hostages held in Gaza, in the village of Dura in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday. TEL AVIV, Israel — A temporary truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire on Wednesday, but mediators in Qatar are trying to extend it for at least another 48 hours to allow for the exchange of more captives and for additional aid to reach embattled Gaza. On the second day of a two-day cease-fire extension, at least another 10 Israelis are expected to be freed by Hamas in exchange for at least 30 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office says it believes that 161 of the original 240 hostages seized by Hamas in last month's attack on Israeli communities are still being held by the Islamist militant group. Israel says about 1,200 people were killed when Hamas fighters swept out of the Gaza Strip and struck nearby Israeli communities. On Tuesday, Hamas freed 10 Israelis and two Thai laborers in exchange for 30 Palestinians prisoners and detainees. The families of Israeli hostages released by Hamas continue to share stories of their relatives' captivity, with some relatives speaking to media outlets. Gideon Heiman says his 84-year-old mother did not receive necessary medical treatment while being held Gaza. Israeli doctors also say rescued hostages have returned malnourished. One of the former captives is in stable condition at a hospital, but her family says her neurological condition is still unclear. Devora Cohen says her 12-year-old nephew Eitan told her that his captors used guns to threaten crying Israeli children to be quiet. Earlier, a U.S. official told NPR that CIA Director William Burns was in Doha for meetings with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and David Barnea, the chief of Mossad, Israel's spy agency. Speaking to NPR, an Israeli official on Tuesday also reiterated that ""Israel has consistently said that as long as more hostages are released, it would address the possibility of further extending the pauses."" Meanwhile, Hamas told mediators that they approve of extending the truce for four days, Israeli media reported. Israeli media also has said that a longer cease-fire could be in the works to secure the release of all the hostages and a large number of Palestinian prisoners. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that ""airstrikes, shelling, and ground clashes have largely ceased,"" since the temporary truce went into effect on Friday, but said that ""exchange of fire reportedly took place between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in the Beit Hanoun area, in the north, and Israeli forces reportedly used tank fire at open areas in the south."" The pause has allowed Egypt and the Palestinian Red Crescent Societies and U.N. agencies ""to enhance the delivery of assistance into and across Gaza."" The U.N. said a Red Crescent aid convoy carrying food, medical supplies, water and non-food items reached areas north of an informal dividing line that bisects Gaza. Israel's military, which has focused its military campaign on the north, has warned Gazans to move south of the line. Even with the aid convoy reaching the embattled north, OCHA emphasized that ""the bulk of aid distribution during the day"" took place in the south. It also cautioned that the aid reaching Gaza since the pause ""is insufficient to meet the extensive needs."" On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called for ""a full humanitarian ceasefire, for the benefit of the people of Gaza, Israel and the wider region.""",3995,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215762834/hostages-israel-hamas-ceasefire-truce-gaza-war,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story arqub truce distribution divide image expire effect palestinian swept nation item region islamist gaza south united burn assistance israel eitan military hazem medium stable village treatment william jassim captive delivery affair convoy ceasefire ground water food north daniel doha informal gazans hour emphasize gun focus netanyahu seize wider abu crescent extensive hanoun shell extension long continue family possibility threaten call community address agency getty newly devora nearby release share barnea move report israeli meet abdulrahman society additional bulk medical pause embattle secure hamas neurological qatari lamees detainee set monday attack meeting benjamin coordination fire office approve extend dura open wednesday full outlet cry number father relative month longer malnourish doctor npr receive strip red expect arm tank egypt hospital quiet beit believe freed aviv force west bisects thani large place campaign thai antónio airstrikes mediator spy clash original work militant exchange official bank director told rescue mohammed reiterate qatar friday tel carry largely child minister humanitarian cease reach aid former prison prime prisoner caution laborer occupy jail cia ocha mossad gideon return captivity benefit kill temporary captor estrin tuesday struck fighter caption cohen mother guterres earlier held hide line kiss group chief david unclear reportedly hostage area insufficient supply warn day consistently condition nephew heiman speak enhance,-0.0868,0.2252816020025031,10.539944751381212,0.3421739718614719,0,2023-11-29
CNN,‘I kissed her but she wouldn’t wake up.’ Grandfather grieves for 3-year-old granddaughter killed as she slept in Gaza,2023-11-29 05:41:00,Jomana Karadsheh,"Picking through the rubble of his destroyed home, Khaled Nabhan lifts a doll that had belonged to his granddaughter and kisses it.Toys and memories are all he has left of his beloved grandchildren, 3-year-old Reem and 5-year-old Tarek, who were killed last week while they were sleeping in their bed.Their home was brought down by what Nabhan said was a nearby Israeli airstrike in the Al Nuseirat refugee camp in southern Gaza. Nabhan has only just managed to return, following the pause in fighting.Speaking to CNN from the ruins of his home, Nabhan described the final evening he had with his grandchildren, breaking down in tears as he recalled how they begged him to take them outside to play. He had refused because of the danger from Israeli airstrikes, he said.“They kept asking for fruit but there is no fruit because of the war,” he said. Clutched in his hand was a tangerine that he’d given Reem as a treat, but that she never had the chance to eat. “I could only find them these tangerines.”The family was asleep when the airstrike hit. Khaled said he woke up screaming for his children and grandchildren, struggling to walk through the dark and the wreckage to find them.“I couldn’t find anyone, they were buried underneath all this rubble,” he said, standing on a bed in a room full of debris.Nabhan showed CNN videos and photos of the family in happier times, of the children singing, laughing and playing. In one clip, Nabhan throws his granddaughter into the air and catches her while Reem giggles with delight. In another image, Nabhan grins while riding a bicycle, his granddaughter sits on the handlebars wearing a pretty yellow dress and white flowers in her hair.The two were inseparable, he said. With their father abroad working, the family lived with their grandfather and he was Reem’s whole world.Her favorite game was pulling his beard and he would pull her piggy tails, he said.“I’ll let go, if you let go,” she says giggling in a video.In the battered bedroom of their house in Gaza, Nabhan showed CNN where his daughter Maysa — Reem and Tarek’s mother — was sleeping when the house collapsed. She and her sister survived but were seriously injured.Speaking to CNN from a relative’s house in Gaza where they are recuperating, Maysa said she remembered screaming and something heavy pinning her down.“I heard Reem screaming next to me, I told her there is something heavy on top of me, I can’t reach you. I said my final prayers and next I woke up in the hospital,” she said.Maysa woke up to the news her young children were gone. Their lifeless bodies were found together under the rubble.“At the hospital I was just numb. I hugged them, I wanted to get as many hugs as I could. No matter how much I hugged them I didn’t get enough,” Maysa said.For nearly seven weeks, most people in the Gaza Strip have been just trying to survive, focusing on the basics: finding shelter, fleeing the fighting, getting access to food and water.The pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas has given many families in Gaza the chance to go outside, buy supplies and return home to retrieve belongings or even bury the bodies of their loved ones.For many Gazans like Nabhan, the truce has also deepened the heartache as they take stock of their new, devastated surroundings. The weeks of airstrikes and fighting have left entire neighborhoods levelled to the ground and many are now able to see the full scale of the devastation for the first time.More than 14,800 Palestinians, including 6,000 children, have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas terror attacks of October 7, according to figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank, which draws its data from Hamas-run health authorities in the Gaza Strip.Earlier this month, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Gaza is “becoming a graveyard for children,” adding that “The nightmare in Gaza is more than a humanitarian crisis. It is a crisis of humanity.”His comments came four weeks after Israel declared war on Hamas, following the Islamist militant group’s deadly October 7 terror attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 others kidnapped and taken back to Gaza – the largest single day attack on Israel since the country’s founding in 1948.The temporary truce has also brought joy as those hostages released by Hamas as part of the deal agreed last week finally returned to Israel and reunited with their families in heart wrenching scenes. Others still face an anxious wait for news of the fate of their loved ones, including mutliple children, still held captive by militants in Gaza.Grieving grandfather Nabhan says his grandchildren were too young to understand the war they lived and died in. He is not a fighter, he said, and his family had nothing to do with the war.Now his grandchildren will never be able to dress up, play, or eat their favorite treats.Nabhan was seen around the world in a widely shared video of his moment of grief last week as he kissed his lifeless 3-year-old granddaughter goodbye.“I used to kiss her on her cheeks, on her nose and she would giggle,” he said. “I kissed her but she wouldn’t wake up.”In another social media video, the two children’s bodies lay prepared for burial in white shrouds while Nabhan fixes Tarek’s hair.“I combed his hair like he would always ask me to, like a photo he would always show me,” Nabhan said. “He loved his hair like that, now he’s gone.”From his ruined home, Nabhan searches through his damaged possessions and bundles up armfuls of colorful toys — the loss etched into the lines of his face.“I was wishing, hoping that they were only sleeping,” he said. “But they weren’t sleeping, they are gone.",5750,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/middleeast/gaza-truce-israel-grandfather-returns-home-intl-hnk/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,grin news truce kidnap reunite fate widely image batter belong palestinian data social laugh moment grandchild draw loss islamist granddaughter pin gaza health final yellow deadly israel wait level maysa devastate back matter possession prepared deal medium ministry collapse buy part clutched captive include asleep wish underneath ground heartache food entire civilian anxious retrieve happier hit recuperate wake gazans pull time offensive nose piggy walk doll hop ruin focus home joy game tail cnn handlebar find stock clip destroyed hand accord etch rid family bundle declare shroud nearby release share love israeli catch heard pause october southern bed beloved throw beg single hamas prayer burial search attack sing refugee found crisis photo full scene flower father relative break abroad colorful mutliple hair month bicycle grandfather sits strip left numb scale bedroom toy neighborhood heavy khaled lay hospital graveyard fruit brought finally beard launch country tear west combed nightmare large comment antónio understand airstrikes nuseirat delight inseparable struggle wreckage work refuse tangerine militant wear add memory lift house bank figure hug told tarek survive fix damage lifeless recall agree give young armful child live humanitarian flee woke reach dark room rubble pretty surroundings giggle remember world bury grief authority daughter show airstrike return video access pick follow play kill temporary scream fighter described guterres eat mother shelter camp treat week held white reem chance wrench favorite line basic kiss group air dress deepen danger body response nabhan heart cheek hostage supply fight sleep day devastation sister manage top belonging stand terror,-0.62935,0.6260869565217391,8.279507908611599,0.4300968175968176,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,The next front in the tech war with China: Graphite (and clean energy),2023-11-29 05:00:00,Lily Kuo,"A new front has opened in the intensifying U.S.-China tech war: This time, it’s over the metals needed to power electric vehicles and make the computer chips and electronics that fuel the U.S. economy.And Beijing has made clear its restrictions on critical minerals are payback for Washington’s efforts to curtail Chinese access to advanced American semiconductors.“This is just the beginning,” Wei Jianguo, former vice commerce minister, said in July, when China restricted exports of gallium and germanium, which are used in high-performance semiconductors, weapons systems and solar panels.“China has many means and types of sanctions it can use. If restrictions on our high-tech industry continue to escalate, China’s countermeasures will also escalate,” he warned.China is now doing just that. From Friday, new restrictions on another key mineral — graphite, a soft form of carbon used in almost all electric car batteries, as well as semiconductors and nuclear reactors — will come into effect. The rules will require exporters of high-grade graphite to apply for approval, and were announced just three days after Washington released new controls to limit artificial intelligence chips heading to China.It is Beijing’s newest and possibly most potent weapon to wield in its competition with Washington, one that could strike at the heart of American efforts to create green jobs while weaning the country off fossil fuels.Washington has deemed all three minerals targeted — graphite, gallium and germanium — as “critical,” meaning they are key to the United States’ economic or national security and vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. The United States is reliant on Chinese imports for all three of them.China is using its dominance over key materials to exert political pressure, said Jost Wubbeke, an expert in Chinese industrial policy and co-founder at Sinolytics, a research consultancy. “The U.S. is also doing it very well, so that’s what China is trying to do.”The tit-for-tat export controls underline how much U.S.-China competition has widened. China and the United States have been locked in a years-long rivalry over issues like Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Ukraine war and China’s human rights record. As the world’s two largest economies jockey for global leadership, export controls and protectionist policies are becoming a bigger part of the fractious relationship.It’s no accident that China dominates critical metals, including another key set of minerals: rare earths, a group of 17 elements needed for almost all of today’s clean energy technology and advanced manufacturing, from smartphones to weapons systems. Between 2018 and 2021, 74 percent of U.S. imports of rare earths came from China.China’s control of rare earths began three decades ago with targeted industrial policies and export subsidies, helped by cheap labor and a willingness to withstand the heavy environmental toll of mining and processing. The architect of China’s economic transformation, Deng Xiaoping, quipped in 1992 that “the Middle East has oil; China has rare earths.”As of last year, China accounted for 70 percent of the world’s production of rare earths. China also refines more than half of the world’s lithium and 80 percent of its cobalt, both key parts of batteries, and dominates supplies of nickel and manganese.China is the world’s top producer of graphite as well as the United States’ single largest source of the material, accounting for a third of U.S. imports of graphite. Other U.S. allies are even more dependent. South Korea and Japan rely on China for more than 90 percent of their graphite needs.Just as Washington imposed semiconductor export controls to slow China’s military ambitions, Beijing says its new restrictions on minerals exports will be “conducive to better safeguarding national security and interests.”This is not the first time Beijing has used its chokehold over critical materials against rivals. In 2010, after a maritime dispute where Japan arrested the captain of a Chinese fishing boat, China blocked exports rare earths to Japan for two months.Even as it targets graphite, China is not yet blocking American access to rare earths.“If they really wanted to kill us, they would [restrict exports of] rare earths. We know they’re willing to use them,” said Gracelin Baskaran, a mining economist focused on critical minerals at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, citing the action against Japan.Chinese state media and officials have long hinted that this is a possibility. This month, China’s Commerce Ministry issued new rules requiring that exporters of rare earths report details of their overseas shipments to the government.Chinese leader Xi Jinping stressed the importance of rare earths as a “strategic resource” during a visit to a magnet maker in Jiangxi province in 2019 at the height of the trade war with the Trump administration.The People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, then ran an article saying there was “no mystery” about whether China would use its rare earths as a “counter weapon.”Just last month the head of the Nonferrous Metals Society of China told the Global Times that China’s prowess in rare-earth refining means it could impose “reciprocal sanctions” on competitors. A communiqué from a rare earths forum organized by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry this month called on the country to “consolidate the advantages of being a global resource power.”Still, China appears to be allowing some room to maneuver with its recent measures targeting graphite, which the U.S. government had deemed critical in the short-term because of its importance to energy security and threats to supply.The new restrictions are not a wholesale ban on graphite exports. Instead they let authorities pick and choose what companies will be blocked from importing Chinese graphite. Under the new rules, which categorize the metal as a “dual-use” item that can be used in military or civil applications, Chinese exporters must apply for special licenses and disclose the details of their buyers.Chinese authorities can choose to block those applications in the name of national security, or they can continue approving them as has been the case for the last several years. Analysts said it won’t be clear for another few months, after new license applications are processed, whether Beijing really intends to limit exports of these minerals.“This is a warning shot for a sure,” said Emily Benson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies focusing on trade and technology. “Will they really bite? Probably not, but it’s a sign that the more tools you use to combat China economically, the greater the risk of retaliation.”For China, restricting the exports of raw materials like graphite could enable it to kill two birds with one stone: Not only will it punish the United States, it could also encourage Chinese companies to move up the value chain and export finished products like magnets, batteries, EVs, solar panels and wind turbines.But the strategy is not without risks. Even some within China have criticized the controls.Controlling rare earth exports would encourage more investment elsewhere and “weaken the international influence of our country’s rare earth industry,” Chen Zhanheng, deputy secretary general of the China Rare Earth Industry Association, told the Chinese outlet Cailian in August.An industry analyst, Zhang Jun, said controls would only raise prices and encourage companies to move away from using rare earths. Tesla said in March that its next-generation batteries would be free of rare earths. Any restrictions on exports, on top of the dire state of the Chinese economy, would hit Chinese companies all along the supply chain hard.“The market is so bad this year that many small- and medium-sized magnet makers cannot survive,” Zhang told Cailian.The United States and like-minded countries — including Japan, South Korea and some in Europe — are already looking to diversify their supply chains to rely less on China.Lynas, the largest rare earths miner outside China, is building a rare earths refinery in Australia. Production has resumed at a rare earths mine in Mountain Pass, between California and Nevada, that had been shuttered for years.

NHK reported that rescuers found three people near the crash site, but their condition is unknown. Japan's Defense Ministry said the coast guard received an emergency call about the crash of a U.S. military Osprey aircraft. The ministry said the aircraft took off from the city of Iwakuni, home to a U.S. Marine Corps Air Station, and was headed for Kadena Air Base on the island of Okinawa. Local media report that eyewitnesses saw the aircraft going down off of Yakushima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture with one engine on fire. U.S. and Japanese authorities say the planes are safe, but some Japanese residents disagree and have protested their deployment in their communities. Ospreys are a cross between an airplane and a helicopter. In August, an Osprey crashed off the coast of northern Australia, killing three U.S. marines.

Washington Post,"London’s iconic black cabs to appear on Uber app, after years of resistance",2023-11-29 04:41:00,"Joyce Lau, Frances Vinall","Starting next year, you may be able to hail one of London’s famous black cabs on the Uber app, the ride-hailing company announced.The San Francisco-based firm, which has been edging into the taxi market worldwide, already works with cabbies in Paris, New York and Rome. It launched its partnership with D.C. taxis about a year ago.Uber’s app can already be used in Britain to book planes, trains, rented cars and even, for a period, a “coronation carriage” that was a replica of the one used by King Charles. However, it was not linked to black cabs, whose drivers have been resisting working with the app for nearly a decade.Uber tried to launch a London black cab option in 2014, but only recruited a handful of drivers and abandoned the effort, according to the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, which says it represents the majority of the city’s self-employed licensed cabbies.In 2019, the group hailed London transport authorities’ decision not to renew Uber’s license to operate in the city after thousands of trips were made with drivers who were different than the ones who were booked. Transport for London cited “several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk.” The company succeeded in an appeal in 2020 and received a 30-month license to operate in London last year.Under the new arrangement, users on the Uber app who want a black cab will receive an estimated price range, based on the meter time and distance; cabbies can then choose to accept or reject the offer. All new drivers will pay no commission to Uber their first six months, Uber said in the statement.Steve McNamara, the LTDA’s general secretary, said that “there is no demand for this partnership” from drivers or passengers, who can hail black cabs on other apps like Gett, TaxiApp, FREENOW and ComCab. He added that taxi trade groups were not consulted before what he called a “unilateral announcement.”“We have no interest in sullying the name of London’s iconic, world-renowned black cab trade by aligning it with Uber, its poor safety record and everything else that comes with it,” McNamara said.London, which has the world’s oldest regulated taxi service, is home to the black cab, also called hackney carriages. Its drivers must pass the Knowledge, a test of the city’s thousands of streets and which can require several years of study, according to Transport for London.Howard Taylor, a licensed taxi driver, said in the LTDA statement that “cabbies work hard to do the Knowledge and we take great pride in what we do. London black cabs are the gold standard. We go the extra mile to help our passengers and are committed to providing a safe, accessible and efficient service. From everything I’ve seen, I don’t believe Uber shares these commitments.”",2758,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/29/london-black-cabs-uber-taxi-partnership/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,paris accessible month company charles accept receive secretary knowledge ltda passenger extra taxi britain interest license demand resist regulate make rome mcnamara believe launch unilateral great year option range reject commission iconic book replica safety gett hard require hackney place effort york king carriage represent offer work base firm add operate handful efficient statement period choose standard app meter cab taxiapp distance famous gold time recruit sully edge link home hail london coronation general plane estimate worldwide appeal train start accord test provide taylor poor world uber call rent pride city authority arrangement share driver transport different car black mile user renew breach commit freenow service partnership decision commitment apps street trip san group comcab consult succeed thousand association safe pay study price abandon trade majority market align cabby record,0.9728,0.1087744742567077,8.629279112754155,0.4204991087344027,0,2023-11-29
CNN,This 10-month old is among the children still held captive or missing in Gaza,2023-11-29 03:31:00,Rhea Mogul,"At 10-months-old, Kfir Bibas has now spent more than a fifth of his young life in captivity, his doe-eyed face and bright red hair a vivid symbol of the pain and suffering endured by Israel’s hostage families.More than 50 days since his abduction by Hamas militants from their home in southern Israel, Kfir’s family say they are no closer to knowing whether he is safe – or even alive.“We are really, really worried about him,” Eylon Keshet, a cousin of the family, told CNN, holding a photograph of the baby boy.“We are not sure if he can make it. Every day that he is staying there is a real, real danger to his life.”Kfir, his four-year-old brother Ariel, their mother, Shiri, and presumably their father Yarden were all kidnapped from Nir Oz, an Israeli kibbutz that was devastated when it came under attack by Hamas militants on October 7. The attackers murdered more than a quarter of the community and seized scores of others, as they fired at people’s homes, looted and destroyed what they could.Some 1,200 people, most civilians, were slain by Hamas across southern Israel that day – the largest terror attack on Israel since the country’s founding in 1948.A video of the Bibas family’s abduction became one of the early striking moments of that day, as a terrified Shiri clung tightly to her children, with Ariel still sucking his pacifier. The children do not cry, nor make a sound as Hamas militants surround their shaken mother, a blanket wrapped around her body. Their grandparents were killed in the attack, Keshet added.The boys’ father was hit by a hammer, his sister has said, with no further information available on his current condition or whereabouts. Yarden’s cousin, Keshet, has said the family believes Yarden was separated from his wife and children, based on videos that they have seen.“It doesn’t make any sense that anyone can let this keep going,” Keshet said. “It’s inhumane. It’s so scary.”Hamas is believed to have held more than 200 hostages in Gaza prior to the releases negotiated with Israel. Under the breakthrough truce agreement, groups of Israeli citizens and other nationals – mostly women and children, in line with the terms of the agreement﻿ – have been freed every day since last Friday.More than 14,800 Palestinians, including 6,000 children, have since been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas terror attacks of October 7, according to figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank, which draws its data from Hamas-run health authorities in the Gaza Strip.As part of the truce deal Israel has released Palestinian women and children detainees from its prisons, many of whom have never been charged or sentenced.The initial four-day truce was extended by an additional two days on Monday, as stories began to trickle out from the families of freed hostages, giving the first insights into what life had been like in captivity.On Monday, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that the Bibas family is not currently held hostage by Hamas, which further complicates release efforts.While Hamas runs Gaza, other militant groups operate there including organizations such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Kfir, Ariel and Shira’s names are yet to appear on a list of hostages expected to be freed. An estimated eight children are still being held by Hamas, and their faces have galvanized a mourning nation clamoring for their return.More than 100 people gathered in Tel Aviv on Tuesday to release orange balloons into the sky to honor the two Bibas boys and their mother, agency pictures showed.The sheer youth of Kfir has captured Israeli attention and anguish. The baby boy was still being bottle-fed and wasn’t at a stage where he was eating solid food when he was taken.“He needs baby formula,” Keshet said through tears, adding the family is also extremely worried about Ariel’s health.“Ariel is a fragile child and has several medical conditions,” he said, explaining that the four-year-old has a skin condition which needs treatment. “He is such a lively child, and he really loves cars and tractors,” he added.For Shiri’s cousin, Yifat Zailer, the days and nights have been “emotional and stressful.”“The little hope that we have gives us the strength to carry on,” she told CNN. “(We are) pleading and asking for the freedom of our family.”Every day, Zailer hopes to see her family’s names on the list of hostages to be released.“There’s a 10-month-old baby that is still being held captive. His life is at risk. No child should be pawned or held as leverage,” she said, her face gaunt and eyes sullen.“Hopefully this will be over soon, and we can somehow go on to repair our shattered – completely shattered – life here.”",4744,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/middleeast/kfir-shiri-ariel-bibas-israel-hostage-intl-hnk/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story insight stage suffer run truce strike kidnap information inhumane nation palestinian data separate moment draw leverage photograph gather hagari gaza health bibas solid shira fragile sheer make real worried grandparent israel devastate eylon clung freedom deal ministry agreement treatment orange surround part captive eye include murder food civilian zailer daniel strength hit picture gaunt oz tractor quarter closer woman offensive honor citizen youth home abduction seize spokesperson estimate shiri cnn destroyed baby accord family brother wrap community agency release love emotional formula israeli score islamic current additional available medical october organization southern hamas detainee nir pain monday attack attacker keshet spent safe found fire endure extend hammer anguish initial cry kfir father hair shatter red expect symbol pacifier night currently believe freed balloon launch country aviv tear force prior west skin tightly pawn large begin early extremely national base militant life add whereabouts operate bank sound blanket figure mourn told kibbutz shaken hold tel carry young give charge child plead sky vivid attention trickle yarden prison presumably risk repair boy cousin clamor list breakthrough lively stay authority complicates terrify video car captivity negotiate defense yifat kill tuesday slain mother eat term held completely line group capture ariel danger bright body hope explain response wife loot hostage day condition galvanize sister suck terror,-0.99125,0.2529510961214165,8.695725026852845,0.4100885225885226,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,U.S. military airplane with six aboard crashes into ocean near Japan,2023-11-29 02:55:00,not specified,"TOKYO — A U.S. military Osprey aircraft crashed into the sea near Yakushima island in southern Japan with six people onboard, the Japanese Coast Guard said Wednesday.The Coast Guard originally reported that there were eight people on the aircraft but then changed its statement. It also stated that so far, one person was recovered from the crash scene and taken to a hospital, where he died.The Coast Guard received an emergency call around 2:45 p.m. reporting the crash off the coast of Yakushima, a small, remote island in the Kagoshima prefecture, in the southernmost part of Japan.The aircraft’s left engine appeared to be on fire as it descended into the sea, reported NHK, Japan’s main broadcaster, which also said that fishermen recovered at least three bodies from the sea.Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said in a news conference that the aircraft disappeared from radar at 2:40 p.m. The 10th Regional Coast Guard of Kagoshima is investigating the incident.The Defense Ministry stated that the aircraft belonged to the U.S. base at Yokota.Ospreys were temporarily grounded in Okinawa after a crash involving one of the U.S. military aircraft in December 2016. Because of safety concerns, the Osprey has been controversial in Japan.In August, three U.S. Marines were killed when an Osprey crashed during routine exercises in Australia. Five Marines were killed in June 2022 when an Osprey crashed in California. There was also a crash in March 2022 in Norway, killing four, and crashes in Syria and Australia in 2017.The Marine Corps is the service most associated with the tilt rotor MV-22B Osprey, which takes off and lands like a helicopter but can transition into a fixed wing aircraft while in flight. It is used for transporting personnel and equipment and is lauded for its speed and flexibility.The aircraft, however, is associated with several deadly crashes, and its safety record has been under regular scrutiny.",1941,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/29/us-osprey-japan-crash-yakushima/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,news equipment conference helicopter japanese receive secretary left belong emergency okinawa laud hospital controversial fisherman december reporting radar engine investigate deadly recover military transition state safety originally ministry part coast island person remote routine small onboard june ground base change tilt statement wing guard personnel broadcaster nhk syria fix tokyo speed norway california crashed disappear temporarily regular yakushima matsuno cabinet involve japan regional prefecture call descend transport kagoshima report associate defense kill hirokazu aircraft corp crash service southern land concern august body marine osprey rotor fire march australia exercise southernmost scene flight record scrutiny,-0.9417,0.927357032457496,11.681876832844573,0.3242979242979243,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,Gaza war complicates U.S. efforts to normalize Arab relations with Israel,2023-11-29 01:00:00,Susannah George,"MANAMA, Bahrain — The war in Gaza is testing newly strengthened ties between Arab countries of the Persian Gulf and Israel, raising questions about an American-backed vision for regional order that emphasizes economic ties over political differences and historical rifts.While the conflict is unlikely to lead to the severing of diplomatic relations, it has scrambled the calculations of emergent gulf powers that see in Israel a potential security partner and a counterweight to regional rival Iran. Now, leaders must grapple with an outpouring of public anger over a war that has killed more than 13,300 Palestinians and left much of the Gaza Strip in ruins.In speeches, statements and social media posts, gulf leaders have condemned the death and destruction in Gaza, but they have also been careful to stress the importance of regional stability and lines of communication. Qatar, the country most diplomatically engaged in the crisis, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel but has succeeded in mediating a temporary pause in the fighting — allowing for the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.The United States has championed Arab normalization with Israel across two administrations. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain formalized ties with Israel in 2020 under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, followed by Morocco and Sudan. Washington had hoped that Saudi Arabia — the gulf’s dominant power — would be next. Now, those plans are on hold.“I cannot prove what I’m about to say,” President Biden said earlier this month. “But I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when they did was they knew that I was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region to bring peace to the region by having recognition of Israel and Israel’s right to exist.”Saudi Arabia has called for a comprehensive cease-fire in Gaza, describing the war as a “dangerous development” and a “humanitarian catastrophe.” At home, the kingdom has taken steps to channel public expressions of solidarity with Palestinians into relief and fundraising efforts.Speaking on Nov. 18 at the IISS Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia’s Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former ambassador to Washington and senior member of the royal family, said the crisis in Gaza has shown that regional peace efforts that fail to address the occupation of Palestinian land are an “illusion.”“This war is a turning point in the process of a serious search for a just solution to the Palestinian issue,” he said. Moving forward, any effort must address “the legitimate demand of the Palestinians for self-determination.”The UAE and Bahrain have defended their ties with Israel, saying it allows them to act as a moderating force in the crisis.Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the president of the UAE, said his country has leverage with Israel that otherwise would not exist. He said they have used their influence so far to push for humanitarian relief, “but this leverage will also grow at some stage.”When asked if anything would compel the UAE to break ties with Israel, Gargash was circumspect: “What we have found through our diplomatic process is that instant gratification is not the solution in politics. Communication is the solution in politics.”But on social media, at protests and in dinner table conversations, many gulf citizens say they want their leaders to do more.“We haven’t seen any benefit. We should pressure Israel. That is how you end apartheid, with boycott,” said a 45-year old pharmacist who attended an anti-normalization protest recently with her sister and infant niece in Manama, the capital of Bahrain. She, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss politically sensitive subjects.“With normalization, what you are saying is that what’s happening to the Palestinian people is normal,” she said. The woman, whose family is Palestinian, said she doesn’t believe that diplomatic ties with Israel have helped the region.“If we had stability, you wouldn’t have what’s happening in Gaza. The instability was always there. Now it’s just out in the open for everyone to see.”As public anger grows, Israeli businesses in the gulf have adopted lower public profiles. They are sitting out trade shows, pulling advertising and downsizing official delegations.“Beneath the surface, it’s business as usual. We just advertise the relationship less,” said one businessman in the gulf who works extensively with Israeli companies.“The business relationship was there before [the Abraham Accords], and it will be there after this blows over,” he said.But consumers are speaking with their wallets. A grass-roots boycott movement against Western brands, including Starbucks and McDonald’s, has gained support in the gulf and across the Arab world.A 30-year-old Kuwaiti social media consultant who has spent her whole life in Dubai described the relationship with Israeli businesses in the UAE as “uncomfortable.” She said she used to meet regularly with representatives from Israeli brands but has taken a step back since the war began. She doubts things will ever return to how they were before Oct. 7, when Hamas militants killed at least 1,200 people across southern Israel.While, on the surface, life in the UAE appears to go on as normal, the woman said the war was all-consuming. It dominates conversations with friends and family. “Everyone is just feeling numb,” she said. Like thousands of others, she joined a government-organized aid drive in Dubai.“I wanted to have an outlet to feel like I am making a difference, even if it’s trivial,” she said. “This is the best I can do. Your hands are tied, so you’re going to do whatever you can do within your resources.”However widespread the feelings of helplessness and frustration here, she said they haven’t translated into anti-government sentiment.“Some people hope the UAE would have a stronger stance, but at the end of the day they trust the government because there is information that we don’t know about,” she said. “We know they prioritize security and stability because look at the track record.”In Bahrain, the anger feels more raw, and potentially more worrying for authorities.A few miles from the five-star hotel hosting the security summit in Manama, hundreds of people marched against normalization, chanting “From Ramallah to Bahrain, we are one nation, not two” and “No to displacement, no to normalization, long live Palestine!”The march was granted a protest permit by Bahrain’s government — an acknowledgment, attendees said, that public discontent is now an undeniable political force.Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa cautioned against actions that undermine “the rules-based order” in his speech marking the opening of the summit. He said countries such as his must work “with all of the parties involved to make sure that our voice” is heard. The longer the war in Gaza lasts, he cautioned, the more likely it will lead to instability and extremism.Nearby, in a neighborhood dotted with sleek restaurants and cafes, dozens of people gathered recently outside the office of a Palestinian advocacy group, calling on the government to break ties with Israel.A 33-year-old Bahraini man, who works as a private art curator and described himself as a government supporter, admitted he was never comfortable with his country’s decision to normalize relations with Israel. Now, after seeing the brutality of the war in Gaza, he hopes that authorities will reverse course.“I don’t think a society’s values are ever perfectly reflected by its leadership, but on this I hope it changes. I hope they cut ties,” he said.In Shiite parts of this Sunni-ruled kingdom, where resentment has long simmered, the war in Gaza is fueling more overt fury.Outside a Shiite mosque in the north, following Friday prayers, dozens of men, women and children gathered, holding signs calling for Israel to be erased and accusing American leaders of genocide.“We are a small voice, but an important voice,” said a 35-year-old travel agent on the edge of the gathering.",8094,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/29/gulf-gaza-israel-uae-bahrain/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point partner potentially leader information host beneath formal rival calculation post nation palestinian region social administration regularly leverage abraham channel gather capital gargash peace surface gaza demand united american chant extensively politics condemn make acknowledgment brand dominates ramallah sign forward boycott turki important difference israel voice fuel back starbucks act feel medium part turn order advocacy compel include small fundraise consultant stance conflict political recently north power mcdonald politically change government scramble instability influence development ambassador statement spoke western usual bahraini dialogue pull reason grows woman economic adopt normalize cafe relief edge hop occupation citizen admit home drive plan salman trust infant moderate downsize describe consumer careful agent restaurant hand long reflect sleek accord involve security family interviewed call address bahrain newly move strengthen release diplomatically reverse sensitive gulf sever mile discus israeli grapple meet protest society iis stress heard tie supporter pause knew profile southern uae mediate decision trivial dozen land attendee hamas issue prayer succeed search instant simmer spent permit happen iran found outpouring stability feeling discontent crisis office accuse action manama question open historical outlet opening speech vision morocco break anonymity table bring anger month longer palestine saudi strip left numb perfectly cut formalize neighborhood brutality undermine arabia erase champion mosque pressure gathering track importance party believe attend grant recognition prince circumspect country solution summit persian force adviser translate state curator kuwaiti private effort biden displacement president begin worry strong emphasizes raise washington relationship prioritize comprehensive work potential militant step frustration life official art emergent travel conversation apartheid crown mark communication sudan kingdom movement qatar advertising businessman helplessness friday hold dot business closely death child live relation humanitarian friend overt normal aid former destruction normalization caution exist blow doubt fail test regional royal diplomatic undeniable public low expression lead authority pharmacist show member return wallet representative gratification resentment benefit dominant follow solidarity kill temporary niece struck dinner dubai described hamad arab senior grow earlier value line leadership join legitimate defend group engage counterweight thousand hope emirate prove comfortable hostage shiite advertise raw process fight widespread march day condition hundred sister article trade speak support dangerous push,0.0413,0.2594514455151964,9.97282422646478,0.3764378530825898,0,2023-11-29
NPR,Ukraine says spy chief's wife is being treated for poisoning with heavy metals,2023-11-29 00:10:00,The Associated Press,"In this file photo, Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, center, attends a commemorative event on the occasion of the Russia Ukraine war one year anniversary in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 24, 2023. KYIV, Ukraine — The wife of Ukraine's intelligence chief has been diagnosed with heavy metals poisoning and is undergoing treatment in a hospital, a spokesperson for the agency said Tuesday as the country's war with Russia stretched into its 22nd month. Marianna Budanova is the wife of Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the military intelligence agency that is known in Ukrainian as GUR for short. Her condition was confirmed to The Associated Press by Andrii Yusov, the agency's spokesman. Yusov did not provide more details about the alleged poisoning, nor did he say if it was believed to have been intended for Budanov or whether Russia was thought to be behind it. Earlier this year, he told Ukrainian media that military intelligence chief had survived 10 assassination attempts carried out by the Russian state security service, or FSB. Previously, Budanov had also told local media that his wife lives with him in his office, which could suggest he was the intended target for the poisoning. There was no immediate comment on the poisoning claim from the Russian government, which has long been suspected of poisoning opponents. Russia media and commentators picked up the Ukrainian reports, with some speculating that it could be part of infighting in Ukraine. Local media, quoting their sources in GUR, said Budanova was hospitalized in Kyiv. The exact nature of the heavy metals that caused the poisoning has not been made public. However, local media said the metals were not used domestically or in military equipment, so the GUR representatives presume the poisoning was carried out intentionally, possibly through food or drink. Apart from Budanova, who has been married to Budanov since 2013, several GUR personnel also were diagnosed with the same poisoning, according to local newspaper Ukrainska Pravda. An official statement with more details was expected to be released by GUR. Budanova, who holds a degree in psychology and acted as an advisor to Kyiv's mayor before the war, spoke about her experiences being married to Ukraine's spy chief to local media. In an interview in October 2022 to Ukraine's Elle magazine, Budanova described how on the eve of Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 23, her husband informed her it would start the next morning. ""We got together and went to his place of work, and since then we have not been home,"" she said, adding that they did not discuss sending her away somewhere else safer.",2669,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215756943/ukraine-spy-chief-wife-treated-poisoning-heavy-metals,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,equipment month expect infighting press source heavy husband fsb immediate hospital nature attempt ukrainian attends assassination center believe make mayor away country year andrii military act state medium place suspect target comment undergo treatment part magazine stretch gur send ukraine poison marianna spy occasion spokesman work food life add official government pravda statement spoke told personnel commemorative advisor survive detail hold russian file carry domestically presume commentator kyrylo exact eve experience home spokesperson speculate interview invasion safer start long accord provide security opponent intelligence public agency newspaper previously release head drink inform married report representative discus associate hospitalize claim allege tuesday october described service morning anniversary possibly diagnose short picked russia earlier budanova yusov local intentionally psychology kyiv event ukrainska budanov chief wife confirm quote office metal photo condition intend suggest degree,-0.65165,0.0,9.504288577154306,0.2426767676767676,0,2023-11-29

There will be no public celebrations, no twinkling Christmas lights and no decorated tree in Manger Square — not as long, they say, as a state of war reigns over the embattled Gaza Strip, and the majority of its residents cope with Israeli bombardments, the devastation of their homes and a spiraling humanitarian crisis.“This is madness,” Munther Isaac, pastor of Bethlehem’s Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church, told me. “This has become a genocide with 1.7 million people displaced.”Isaac was part of a small delegation of Palestinian Christians who came to Washington this week to lobby the Biden administration, U.S. lawmakers and religious leaders to support calls for a full-scale cease-fire. A six-day pause in hostilities between Israel and militant group Hamas is set to elapse Thursday, though negotiations with Hamas involving U.S., Israeli and Arab officials are ongoing to potentially extend the current truce. Israeli officials have vowed to continue their campaign against Hamas after hostages are released, while the Biden administration appears to be trying to restrain whatever next phase of the war Israel chooses to launch.On Tuesday afternoon, the delegation went to the White House and delivered a letter for President Biden signed by the leaders of the Christian community in Bethlehem, including Isaac’s Protestant denomination and his Orthodox, Armenian and Catholic counterparts. They also went to the Hill to meet staff in the Senate and House of Representatives.“God has placed political leaders in a position of power so that they can bring justice, support those who suffer, and be instruments of God’s peace,” reads the letter, which I got to see in advance of its delivery. “We want a constant and comprehensive cease-fire. Enough death. Enough destruction. This is a moral obligation. There must be other ways. This is our call and prayer this Christmas.”Palestinian Christians belong to the world’s oldest Christian communities, rooted in the historic cradle of Christianity. But they are diminished in number, at least in proportion to their neighbors of other faiths, and are represented in greater strength in the Palestinian diaspora around the world. Palestinian Christians comprise some 2 percent of the overall Palestinian population in the West Bank, concentrated mostly around Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jerusalem, and less than 1 percent of the population in Gaza.The latter community, small but prominent, is in the midst of a potential extinction event. There are roughly fewer than 1,000 Christians in Gaza, who have lived there without much problem despite the de facto takeover of the territory in 2007 by Hamas. But Israeli airstrikes destroyed or damaged almost all the community’s homes in Gaza City while also hitting Gaza’s oldest active church, where some were sheltering. “The vast majority of the Christian community in Gaza are now homeless,” Isaac said.That’s prompted perhaps as much as a fifth of Gaza’s Christians who also had foreign passports to abandon the territory altogether. The rest find themselves forsaken. “They are calling to us, saying, ‘Let us leave, we either die or we leave,’” said Tamar Haddad, a regional coordinator of the Lutheran World Federation who was also part of the visiting delegation.Jack Sara, president of Bethlehem Bible College, pointed to how the plight of Palestinian Christians doesn’t seem to be heard by many U.S. evangelicals, who see in muscular Jewish supremacy over the Holy Land a pathway for their own messianic vision. Tennessee-based evangelical preacher Greg Locke, a vocal and oft-viral pro-Trump clergyman, called for Israel to reduce Gaza to a “parking lot” not long after the Oct. 7 attack. More than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed in the weeks since, including thousands of children.The ideology of Christian Zionism animated the agenda of the Trump administration and influences a vast segment of Republican lawmakers, from former vice president Mike Pence to current Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.). Sara, a leading Palestinian evangelical theologian, told me that their creed “is not the evangelical theology and its message of love of all humans, regardless of their background and ethnicity” in which he believes and practices.Away from Gaza, the members of the delegation described a growing climate of intimidation and hostility toward Palestinian Christians in the West Bank and Jerusalem, fueled by the actions of Jewish extremists emboldened by Israel’s far-right government. “We feel Jewish extreme radicals want us out of Jerusalem and they’re working on it and they’re going unchecked,” Isaac said.The delegation’s members condemned Hamas’s actions and deplored its killing of innocent civilians and abduction of hostages. But they questioned Israel’s declared intention to wipe out an organization that is part of the fabric of Palestinian society and seen as a standard-bearer of resistance to decades of Israeli military occupation and domination. “As horrifying as October 7 was, things did not start there,” Isaac said. “And you cannot just begin the story from there and as such, give a green light for Israel to do what it’s doing right now, which goes way beyond, which is a revenge campaign.”Many leading foreign diplomats have stressed the underlying importance of reviving the long-stalled and moribund process of the two-state solution. Most Palestinians are cynical about this project, given the fecklessness of their own political leadership and the West’s inability to prevent Israel from further carving up the West Bank with settlements over the past two decades. Many Israeli politicians, including leading members of the current government, are also explicitly opposed to the creation of an independent Palestinian state.But any postwar dispensation will have to reckon with the ground realities in Israel and the occupied territories. “One thing is clear: all my interlocutors in the Arab world have accepted Israel’s existence and want to engage with it,” wrote top E.U. diplomat Josep Borrell in a Financial Times op-ed that followed a recent trip to the Middle East. “They recognize the immense opportunity that lies in a peaceful neighborhood, cross-border cooperation and Israel’s potential role as a regional economic driver. But all agree that Arab-Israeli cooperation hinges upon resolving the Palestinian question.”In recent statements, President Biden has also invoked the need to forge a two-state solution as a priority for the region. But talk is cheap. “America needs to prove to the Palestinians that they are serious about the two state solution because any talk from the Americans about a two-state solution right now feels empty, given the lack of action,” Isaac said. “No one has held Israel accountable.”In their letter to Biden, the Palestinian clergymen reiterated their appeal: “This land has been crying for peace and justice for 75 years. It is time justice is served. It is time everybody can live with dignity in this land. The Palestinian and Israeli children deserve to live, hope and dream.”",7522,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/29/palestinian-christians-christmas-ceasefire-cancel/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,supremacy point elapse story news suffer potentially greg leader lack truce hill america clergyman cradle resistance leave opinion tamar belong haddad palestinian region christianity project preacher creation administration dignity isaac peace gaza messianic american faith theology instrument vice role ongoing condemn sign ramallah coordinator great year zionism israel concentrate denomination military fuel clear vast politician dream feel green evangelicals part represent delivery active include small pastor extreme reduce political ground theologian immense million power civilian ideology justice government influence decorate johnson statement strength hit prompt serve fabric horrify lobby intention time jerusalem economic god delegation occupation genocide home letter abduction today extremist find destroyed start diplomat long decide involve message continue deplore counterpart brother declare chooses call community city read hostility tree release diminish creed love light rest agenda middle israeli meet peaceful society carve current stress segment speaker festivity heard pause october resident dispensation past vowed embattle organization recognize land hamas priority facto prayer independent trip existence event set attack globe idea reading empty thursday plight underlie forge talk forsaken extend action abandon question write jewish holy majority pathway cry number vision free bring munther population prominent domination strip cancel east foreign protestant diaspora federation neighborhood altogether negotiation percent interest twinkle midst explicitly muscular republican wipe armenian importance bethlehem obligation locke believe inbox manger reckon solution west josep state place comprise campaign biden homeless president begin takeover airstrikes christmas restrain celebration catholic washington oppose comprehensive work potential militant official house excerpt bank innocent borrell christian accepted told mark reiterate ethnicity vocal afternoon resolve damage square evangelical roughly bible hinge proportion despite agree give death child live humanitarian cooperation cynical fecklessness trump phase background former worldview destruction appeal climate radical inability occupy madness opportunity regional senate world visit penny financial latter newsletter reign extinction public lead driver reality parking cope cheap member follow moribund solidarity decade kill lot settlement revive forgo tuesday problem described postwar shelter arab animate lutheran grow church week held white deliver embolden neighbor spiral territory religious prevent advance leadership bombardment revenge group engage passport constant unchecked lie thousand hope historic recent college prove lawmaker hostage position process invoked deserve human devastation staff mike support top root intimidation orthodox interlocutor,0.7382,0.1595320393512363,10.553377097009475,0.3981084656084656,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,Police officer charged with manslaughter after 95-year-old was Tasered,2023-11-28 23:54:00,Rachel Pannett,"An Australian police officer has been charged with manslaughter in the death of a 95-year-old woman who was Tasered after authorities were called to her nursing home on reports that she was armed with a knife.Clare Nowland, who had dementia, fell to the floor and hit her head after being shocked with the Taser during the May 17 encounter in a nursing home in Cooma, a small town about 250 miles south of Sydney. She died a week later.New South Wales police said in a statement Wednesday that the charges against a 33-year-old senior constable who allegedly Tasered her had been upgraded on the advice of public prosecutors. Previously, he was facing charges of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault.The senior constable, Kristian White, and another officer allegedly found Nowland alone in a treatment room with a serrated-edge steak knife. The officers spent several minutes trying to persuade her to drop the knife, but she did not, police said. When Nowland, who was 5-foot-2, 95 pounds and used a walker, began slowly approaching them, the officer allegedly used his Taser on her.The incident brought an outcry from Nowland’s family, the tightknit rural community and Australian civil liberties advocates, who called for an investigation in to police use of force, The Washington Post reported previously.Under official police guidelines, a Taser should not be used against the elderly or disabled, unless “exceptional circumstances exist.” There is body-camera footage of the incident, but police have previously said that it will not be released to the public.A once-gregarious character who celebrated her 75th birthday by climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and her 80th birthday skydiving, Nowland is described in court documents as “frail.”White is due to appear in court on Dec. 6. At a previous court appearance, the tall, solidly built officer — who has been suspended from active duties — stood silently as local media questioned him about whether his use of force was excessive, as prosecutors have alleged.Warwick Anderson, a solicitor acting for the police officer, said by email that although “the fresh charges are concerning,” he would “continue to defend the matter.”Australian law enforcement authorities have faced allegations of brutality before. A Sydney police constable was charged with assault after footage surfaced in 2021 showing the officer tripping a 16-year-old Indigenous boy and slamming him face-first into bricks while arresting him. A White Australian police officer was last year acquitted in the killing of an Aboriginal teen, in a case that gripped the country.Nowland is survived by eight children, 24 grandchildren and 31 great-grandchildren.",2749,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/28/australia-police-taser-95-year-old/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dementia email knife slowly kristian arm post taser allegedly brutality silently liberty grandchild elderly cooma fresh footage australian south surface brought pound outcry tall persuade bridge steak recklessly assault tightknit bodily climb year force act advice character medium civil allegation advocate treatment begin anderson active small solicitor washington minute occasion built tasered official investigation appearance statement hit survive town nowland upgraded constable police woman harbour due death charge child home aboriginal shock skydive officer acquit gripped nursing grievous excessive room prosecutor boy birthday continue disabled family court call community celebrate public authority actual previously release head show common law report mile previous circumstance kill described case encounter manslaughter senior suspend incident duty arrest sydney week white slam local exceptional approach solidly concern trip harm rural defend drop document spent fell found guideline walker stood indigenous question enforcement wednesday floor brick,-0.976,0.3273917788286649,12.18496868475992,0.234009009009009,0,2023-11-28

NPR,Pope cancels trip to U.N. climate conference on doctors' orders after getting the flu,2023-11-28 15:23:00,The Associated Press,"VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis canceled his trip to Dubai for the U.N. climate conference on doctors' orders Tuesday even though he is recovering from the flu and lung inflammation, the Vatican said. Francis was scheduled to leave Rome on Friday to address the COP28 meeting first thing Saturday morning. He also was supposed to inaugurate a faith pavilion Sunday on the sidelines of the conference before returning home. The pope revealed Sunday that he had lung inflammation but said at the time that he still planned to go to Dubai, where he was to become the first pontiff to address a U.N. climate conference. Tuesday's announcement marked the second time the pope's frail health had forced the cancellation of a foreign trip: He had to postpone a planned trip to Congo and South Sudan in 2022 because of knee inflammation, though he was able to make the journey earlier this year. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said Francis was improving from the flu and inflammation of his respiratory tract that had forced him to cancel his audiences Saturday. But ""the doctors have asked the pope not to make the trip planned for the coming days to Dubai. ""Pope Francis accepted the doctors' request with great regret and the trip is therefore canceled,"" he added. Francis, who turns 87 next month, had part of one lung removed as a young man. Francis came down with the flu late last week. He went to the hospital Saturday for a CAT scan, and the Vatican said the test had ruled out pneumonia. On Sunday, he skipped his traditional appearance at his studio window overlooking St. Peter's Square to avoid the cold. Instead, Francis gave the traditional noon blessing in a televised appearance from the chapel in the Vatican hotel where he lives and asked a priest to read his written daily reflections out loud. Francis coughed and spoke in a whisper, and sported the cannula in which he was receiving antibiotics intravenously. People who saw him this week said his health was improving but he still spoke in a whisper. Francis spent three days at Rome's Gemelli hospital in April for what the Vatican said was bronchitis after he had trouble breathing. He was discharged after receiving intravenous antibiotics. Francis spent 10 days at the same hospital in July 2021 following intestinal surgery for a bowel narrowing. He was readmitted in June of this year for an operation to repair an abdominal hernia and remove scarring from previous surgeries. When asked about his health in a recent interview, Francis quipped in reply what has become his standard line — ""Still alive, you know.""",2580,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/28/1215665055/pope-cancels-trip-to-u-n-climate-conference-on-doctors-orders-after-getting-the-,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,conference rule month narrow doctor improve receive cancel foreign pavilion leave instead skip schedule traditional pope bronchitis hospital bruni south health surgery faith make rome whisper great year recover marked force regret reflection cannula televise trouble intestinal daily sunday antibiotic part turn order abdominal audience priest reply spokesman june life add request late appearance announcement spoke accepted cancellation standard sudan suppose frail square friday time pontiff readmitted young give intravenous postpone home april inflammation respiratory bowel interview discharge remove plan lung operation quipped congo climate repair coughed blessing test pneumonia tract july address saturday overlook city read francis return inaugurate sideline vatican follow previous flu tuesday journey dubai morning knee avoid hernia earlier week line trip intravenously alive meeting sport recent spent cold loud studio day chapel write gemelli window matteo reveal noon scan scar breathing,0.0,0.1162790697674418,9.04809917355372,0.3366858237547892,0,2023-11-28
NPR,What to know about the hostages still held by Hamas,2023-11-28 15:14:00,Scott Neuman,"Israelis gather to witness the first batch of released hostages being brought to Schneider Hospital via helicopter on Nov. 24. TEL AVIV, Israel — Joyful scenes of Israeli hostages freed and their tearful reunions with loved ones have dominated the news in Israel since last week's start of a temporary cease-fire deal with Hamas. So far under that cease-fire, Hamas has released more than 80 of around 240 hostages Israel says Hamas seized in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel. In return, Israel has freed 180 Palestinian prisoners. Of the 61 Israelis released so far, almost all are women and minors. In addition, foreign workers — mostly Thais — have been released in a separate deal. Around 160 hostages remain in captivity. Perhaps 100 are Israeli civilians. Some of the rest are soldiers, seized when Hamas raided military bases in Israel. They may end up being held the longest. There are also dual Israeli American citizens — possibly including some soldiers, according to the U.S. Israeli attacks have killed at least 13,300 people in Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Hospitals are without electricity. Food, water and fuel are in short supply. The U.N. says three-quarters of Gaza's 2.2 million people have been internally displaced by the conflict. Here's what to know about who is still being held hostage and some of the possible complications for releasing more. Hamas hands over 11 Israeli hostages to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza City, Nov. 27. Stringer/Anadolu via Getty Images hide caption Hamas hands over 11 Israeli hostages to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza City, Nov. 27. Israel's army has said that Israeli civilians and foreigners — including U.S. citizens and more than two dozen Thai farm laborers — were among those captured in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. The attack killed some 1,200 people, Israeli authorities say. A ""substantial"" number of Israeli soldiers were also seized, Israel's Haaretz newspaper quoted an army spokesman as saying on the day of the Hamas attack. The Israeli military has not specified how many soldiers were captured. The hostages released so far are mainly Israeli women and minors, as well as a Filipino, a Russian-Israeli man and 19 Thais, mostly men. The Israelis have reported losing weight during their seven weeks in captivity and say they've survived mostly on bread and rice, sleeping on rows of chairs. Many were held underground. On Sunday, a 4-year-old girl, Abigail Mor Edan, a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen, was among those set free. U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the Biden administration believes eight or nine more Americans are still being held but the U.S. does not have ""solid information on each and every one of them."" One Israeli captive, an 84-year-old woman released on Sunday, was flown by helicopter directly from Gaza to an Israeli hospital due to a serious medical condition, according to Israeli media reports. Four hostages were released last month, before the temporary cease-fire, when Hamas freed two U.S. citizens and two Israeli women. Hamas has a history of involvement in hostage situations. In 2006, Hamas abducted an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, to the Gaza Strip, holding him for more than five years before finally handing him over in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners. Israel's current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in power then, too. Dennis Jett, a retired U.S. ambassador, told NPR last month that it ""wasn't lost on Hamas"" that such a steep price could be exacted for a high-value Israeli hostage. In 2007, BBC journalist Alan Johnston was kidnapped by the Army of Islam, a Gaza-based jihadist group, and held for nearly four months, in what he described as ""an appalling experience,"" before Hamas helped secure his release. Each day, Hamas draws up lists of hostages it is willing to release and Israel does the same with Palestinian prisoners. Israel releases three Palestinians for every Israeli hostage Hamas frees, according to the terms of the temporary cease-fire agreement. Speaking on NPR's Morning Edition, Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland, said, ""It's not known why they arrived at this particular ratio, but it is clear that ... Hamas was asking for a lot more."" ""In past exchanges, the ratio was much larger — for one Israeli soldier, there were hundreds of Palestinian prisoners,"" Telhami said. ""Remember that it's very easy for Israel to arrest Palestinians. They are under occupation. Israel has a military. It can go into any town or village and arrest any number of people at any given time."" So far, all the prisoners released have been women or minors, and many who were detained on allegations they threw rocks or Molotov cocktails at troops. Human rights groups have criticized Israel's frequent detention of minors — often hundreds each year — and its process for holding people in detention for months or more without charges.

""Most of them are lone wolves,"" Harel Chorev, a senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, says of those released so far, ""people who tried to commit some sort of an attack but did not succeed."" Going forward, Cherov says, Hamas is likely to want the release of higher-profile prisoners and Israel is going to want higher-value hostages returned in exchange. According to Mustafa Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, there are 8,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons, including 3,200 who have been arrested since Oct. 7. That number, he says, includes 250 Palestinian children and 2,200 inmates held without charge in administrative detention. As the pool of hostages shrinks, Hamas could demand more prisoners, or higher-value ones in exchange for hostages it holds — either under the current deal or a future truce arrangement. CIA Director William Burns arrived in Doha on Tuesday for meetings with Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and David Barnea, chief of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, a U.S. official tells NPR. The meeting in Qatar, a key broker as the temporary cease-fire deal has unfolded, is focused on securing the release of more hostages, and partly about expanding the pause in fighting. Barghouti notes that Gilad Shalit's release by Hamas in 2011 garnered the return of 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Now, in exchange for the remaining Hamas captives, he says, ""It's just natural that 8,000 Palestinian prisoners should also be released. Especially [because] many of those are simply civilians who have not even had any charges or any due legal process."" It's highly unlikely, however, that Israel would agree to such a deal.",7265,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/28/1215353901/hostages-hamas-israel-gaza-palestinian-prisoners,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,involvement garner news joyful truce international kidnap information shrink image broker palestinian cherov cross retire separate administration possible draw gather peace gaza displace demand health maryland american solid worker inmate center reunion forward burn year arrive israel military fuel clear dual deal medium specify directly raid researcher ministry john agreement sunday witness william jassim captive barghouti include legislative spokesman conflict dominate water food million power pool civilian development expand kirby history ambassador threw doha mustafa administrative detention remain sadat anwar time woman steep due especially unfolded occupation focus citizen netanyahu partly dayan seize spokesperson schneider molotov rock natural abigail filipino telhami start long hand accord security appal addition foreigner city newspaper agency getty release love simply barnea bread rest report middle israeli abdulrahman cocktail lose easy current medical pause female highly past morning jihadist ratio arrest mor dozen secure hamas internally set succeed attack frequent meeting benjamin edan quote bbc price minor islam note scene substantial number university free relative month helicopter npr strip red foreign girl army hospital brought finally jett future believe freed underground detain shalit aviv west thani large eastern allegation thai biden moshe weight alan fadel sort african spy abduct national base exchange gilad official bank complication johnston director told mohammed edition hug survive town council flown wolf qatar tel hold lone agree give chorev exact charge child soldier minister experience row prison committee shibley prime prisoner laborer occupy batch list jail remember cia journalist mossad authority arrangement haaretz farm member return rice professor tearful captivity kill temporary lot commit criticize tuesday harel caption described arab possibly term electricity senior short week held legal hide chair group particular chief capture david key hostage supply process fight troop sleep day human study condition hundred speak situation dennis village,-0.019,0.1238816242257398,9.296182085168866,0.3908294086865515,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Panic in Sierra Leone amid fresh gunfire following attacks on military barracks,2023-11-28 12:02:00,Nimi Princewill,"Fresh gunfire was heard in a suburb of the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown, on Tuesday as security forces combed through the city in search of suspects linked to a jailbreak and a foiled attack on a military barracks that left more than 13 people dead.Residents of Freetown said on social media that a fresh round of gunshots was heard on Tuesday afternoon in the Murray Town suburb. Sierra Leone’s information ministry said no one was hurt during the shooting.“As part of ongoing operations to apprehend those responsible for the incidents of November 26th, a few shots were fired around the Murray Town barracks vicinity,” the ministry said in a statement Tuesday. “The person of interest has been arrested and is now in custody of the security forces,” it added.Freetown-based journalist Umaru Fofana also said in a post on Facebook that in the Kingtom area of the city, “the presence of soldiers … caused panic” on Tuesday as they moved to recapture fleeing inmates who are “believed to be hunkering down around the slums” in the area.Police in the West African nation have launched a manhunt to recapture dozens of fleeing inmates who were set free after armed men stormed a prison and other detention centers in Freetown early Sunday.“Thirteen soldiers were killed in action,” Sierra Leone’s army spokesman Colonel Issa Bangura told CNN Tuesday of the botched attack on the army base.“Eight (soldiers) were wounded and three assailants were arrested,” Bangura said, adding that the death toll could be as high as 20.A police statement said some of the inmates who escaped during the jailbreak have turned themselves in but did not provide the number of prisoners who fled. Prison officials estimate that the number of fleeing inmates could be above 1,800.A cash reward has been offered for tip-offs leading to the arrest of either the assailants or prison escapees.A nationwide curfew was imposed following the series of attacks on Sunday, leading to widespread flight disruption at the Freetown International Airport.Authorities reviewed the curfew hours on Monday, saying it would now run from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. daily local time, “until further notice.”“Airport operations will be conducted within the parameters of the revised curfew times,” the country’s aviation authority said.President Maada Bio described the attempted raid on the army barracks as an “attack on democracy” in the West African nation, which has grappled with a political crisis since the conclusion of a disputed general election in June.Police said investigations are ongoing to unravel establish the motive behind the attacks, which were swiftly condemned by the United States, European Union, and regional bloc Ecowas.",2707,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/africa/sierra-leone-military-barracks-attack-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,run international bio information motive european hunker left custody thirteen arm post jailbreak nation high social unravel shot interest army union capital fresh attempt toll united review assailant manhunt dispute inmate ongoing believe center condemn launch country airport force vicinity sierra kingtom military west wound combed state medium raid fofana suspect ministry daily sunday reward part turn leonean person series disruption african offer early spokesman nationwide panic political impose add facebook official presence democracy investigation umaru revise statement told afternoon bangura detention town conduct hour police time election cash bloc curfew death escape soldier link flee general foil recapture prison operation estimate cnn prisoner storm provide murray responsible security aviation regional suburb city journalist move botch lead parameter gunfire authority colonel maada november hurt apprehend grapple follow kill leone tuesday heard issa described round freetown arrest incident dozen local slum establish set search monday attack ecowas area fire free conclusion crisis widespread action swiftly gunshot flight barrack number,-0.9836,0.3324713705208718,11.52519587628866,0.2706851851851851,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Opponents vow ‘beginning of the end’ for Myanmar’s junta as resistance launches nationwide offensive,2023-11-28 03:29:00,Helen Regan,"Almost three years on from its bloody coup, Myanmar’s military junta is facing the biggest threat to its hold on power as it fights wars on multiple fronts across the Southeast Asian nation.In recent weeks, powerful armed ethnic militias have joined with resistance forces to mount major new offensives with unprecedented coordination, exposing the limits of the deeply unpopular junta’s capabilities as it loses strategic border towns, key military positions and vital trade routes at a scale not seen in decades, according to experts.“The junta is actively collapsing right now and that’s only become possible because there is this wider effort across the country,” said Matthew Arnold, an independent Myanmar analyst.Calling it an “existential moment for the military,” Arnold said the resistance is “now focused on taking major towns to fundamentally defeat the junta.”An offensive named Operation 1027, launched in late October by an alliance of three powerful ethnic rebel armies in the country’s northeast, has since catalyzed into a nationwide push to take control of towns and areas in Myanmar’s north, west and southeast.Nearly 200 civilians have been killed and 335,000 people newly displaced by the fighting since October 27, according to the United Nations.Civil war between Myanmar’s myriad ethnic armies and successive military governments has raged for decades. But the latest escalation in fighting comes off the back of nationwide public resistance to army chief Min Aung Hlaing’s February 2021 coup, which sacked the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.The military’s post-coup crackdown on peaceful protesters and documented atrocities against civilians spurred people to take up arms and defend their towns and communities in Myanmar’s rural and urban centers.Since then, battles between the military and resistance groups aligned with the anti-junta National Unity Government in exile have unfolded daily. Junta airstrikes and ground attacks on what the Myanmar military calls “terrorist” targets have killed thousands of civilians to date, including children, and displaced about 2 million people.Those on the ground say they are ultimately fighting to get rid of the junta and establish a federal democracy in which all of Myanmar’s people have full rights and representation.Routing out a deeply entrenched institution like the military, which has ruled for half a decade though brutality and fear, will not be straightforward, and the military’s refusal to back down could drag Myanmar deeper into conflict.But while the latest escalation in conflict since October 27 has not yet stretched to major cities like Yangon, Mandalay, or Naypyidaw, it marks a turning point in that resistance. According to the UN office for humanitarian affairs (OCHA), armed clashes are now the biggest in scale and most extensive seen since the coup.“It’s the beginning of the end of State Administration Council, we are already seeing it,” Bo Nagar, commander of the Burma National Revolutionary Army (BNRA), which is fighting against the military in Myanmar’s central regions, told CNN.Announcing its October offensive, the Three Brotherhood Alliance involving the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), the Kokang’s Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), Arakan Army (AA) and allied peoples defense forces, declared it was “dedicated to eradicating the oppressive military dictatorship.”Its objectives were to “safeguard the lives of civilians, assert our right to self-defense, maintain control over our territory, and respond resolutely to ongoing artillery attacks and airstrikes.”The alliance also vowed to combat the “the widespread online gambling fraud that has plagued Myanmar, particularly along the China-Myanmar border.”In many of the towns dotted along the Chinese and Thai borders, Chinese-run compounds have boomed in recent years. Alleged to be centers of mass online fraud and illegal gambling and hosted by junta militias, they have trapped and trafficked thousands of people into working as online scammers.Members of resistance armies and analysts CNN spoke to say while the junta never had full control of the country, the multi-front war is stretching the military’s capabilities so that it is now being pushed into a defensive position, particularly in the northeast.Myanmar’s junta-installed president Myint Swe gave a rare warning at a defense and security meeting with the top brass in early November that, “if the government does not effectively manage the incidents happening in the border region, the country will be split into various parts.”CNN has reached out to Myanmar’s military spokesperson for comment on the recent fighting but has not received a response.The junta has acknowledged it is engaged in “heavy assaults” and reportedly ordered all government staff and those with military experience in the capital to prepare to serve in case of emergency, according to Reuters. It has also imposed martial law in several northeast towns.The armed forces “will continuously serve necessary security measures for ensuring peace and stability of the region,” it said during the defense meeting.In state media, the junta has denied claims that it has stationed 14,000 troops in the capital Naypyidaw to protect the main military headquarters from the offensives, and denied it was recruiting public servants to attend military training, calling both “fake news and misinformation.”In the mountainous northern border regions of Shan state, the junta has lost control of at least six towns including Chin Shwe Haw and Kunlong – two strategic border towns for trade and transport with China – key roads, and more than 100 military outposts and camps, according to resistance fighters CNN spoke to and local independent media.Severing those transport routes has cut off a vital revenue source for the internationally sanctioned and cash-strapped junta. The alliance claims control of Chin Shwe Haw and the roads leading to the town of Muse, through which 98% of all cross-border trade with China passes, amounting to $2.2 billion from April to October this year, according to Myanmar figures.In western Rakhine state, ethnic minority armed group the Arakan Army (AA) renewed fighting after a year-long temporary ceasefire broke down, opening up a new front. Clashes with junta forces are ongoing in several townships and the town of Pauktaw has “turned into a war zone,” said U Nan Diya, a local village abbot monk.There are also reports of army defections and whole battalions surrendering.In the jungles of southeast Kayah state, fighting has raged near the state capital Loikaw. Video filmed and published by the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force appears to show Myanmar army soldiers surrendering to rebels at Loikaw University who are filmed treating their injuries. CNN cannot independently verify the events.In hilly western Chin state, thousands of people have fled the fighting and crossed the Indian border to Mizoram. Among them were 43 Myanmar soldiers who fled after their military camps were seized by rebels, according to Mizoram police official Lalmalsawma Hnamte. Reuters reported that dozens were sent back to Myanmar.Resistance fighters CNN spoke to said junta soldiers they encounter have lost the desire to fight.“Because of lack of support from the civilians, the soldiers on the ground are lacking morale in fighting,” said Lin Lin, spokesperson for the Burma People’s Liberation Army, which is fighting in Myanmar’s north alongside the Three Brotherhood Alliance, and in the southeast.“When we look at fighting leading to besieging towns, it’s not that they don’t have adequate weapons, but they lack the desire to fight, unlike before… Because of their lack of desire to fight, we are winning more.”While some towns appeared to have fallen with relative ease, others say there is intense fighting in more central strongholds, where it is easier for the military to reinforce and resupply their troops.“When the military column goes to a certain village, we try to distract them to not get to their targeted village by using offensive tactics. There are times we were outnumbered, we had to retreat, that’s when they attacked and destroyed the civilians,” said Bo Nagar, the BNRA commander in Sagaing region.Analysts say ongoing losses suggest the military does not possess the sufficient manpower and fighting capabilities needed to retake them, despite relying on airstrikes and heavy weaponry.“Predicting the ultimate outcome in the ongoing military progress is challenging, as I see it still in the initial phase of the resistance’s strategy. However, one certainty is that Operation 1027 has shifted the military equilibrium in favor of the resistance,” said Ye Myo Hein, fellow at the United States Institute of Peace and the Wilson Center. The military, he said, “is currently under relentless 360-degree attacks across the country.”Analysis from Ye Myo Hein in May suggested the Sit-Tat, as the military is known, is much smaller than commonly thought, with about 150,000 personnel and 70,000 combat soldiers – “barely able to sustain itself as a fighting force, much less a government.”“Notably, during a temporary lull in conflict in northern Shan state, the military’s redeployment of troops from that area to Karenni and Sagaing allowed groups in northern Shan State to achieve significant military gains swiftly. Any further troop movements will present opportunities for resistance to make substantial advances in those areas,” Ye Myo Hein told CNN.There is rising concern that the junta is taking out its battlefield losses on the people.Violence against civilians is a long-used Myanmar military strategy and there is a growing body of evidence that army troops have regularly bombed and burnt entire villages and committed other human rights abuses since the coup.Since the start of the October offensive, monitoring groups have documented junta airstrikes and artillery hitting several Myanmar villages. On November 15, a military airstrike hit a village in Chin state’s Matupi, killing 11 people, including eight children, according to the National Unity Government.Saddled between global heavyweights China and India, with Thailand to its south and Bangladesh to its west, the fighting in Myanmar is threatening to disrupt relations with regional neighbors.Without control of its borders and with fresh waves of refugees scattering into neighboring counties, the junta’s inability to bring stability to the nation risks angering one of its only global allies and main source of investment: China.On Saturday, China’s military conducted live-fire drills and training on the Chinese side of the border with Myanmar, as fierce fighting raged on the Myanmar side, Chinese state media Global Times reported.“The theater command forces are always prepared to respond to various emergencies and are resolute in safeguarding national sovereignty, border stability and the safety of the people’s lives and property,” said Senior Colonel Tian Junli, a spokesperson of the PLA Southern Theater Command, according to Global Times.The paper reported the drills were part of annual training and were “defensive and aimed at safeguarding Chinese sovereignty, stability of border area and safety of personnel from impacts caused by the civil war in Myanmar, rather than an act to intervene in the internal affairs of the neighboring country.”According to Arnold, Myanmar’s neighbors have now lost access to the country – a “brutal reality check” for the junta.“All of the neighboring countries have invested significantly in maintaining positive relations with the junta. But as soon as they start to lose the access to Myanmar that changes their entire geopolitical calculus. I think it’s true of China, but it’s also true of India and Thailand,” he said.Before 2011, Myanmar’s military ruled the country for more than half a century through brutality and fear, turning Myanmar into a poverty-stricken pariah nation.Throughout years of conflict in Myanmar’s jungles and mountains, ethnic people have witnessed and been subjected to atrocities including massacres, rape and other forms of sexual violence, torture, forced labor and displacement by the armed forces, as well as state-sanctioned discrimination.The coup abruptly ended a 10-year transition period that briefly ushered in greater democratic and economic reforms. But the military still retained outsized influence, and for many ethnic people the long documented abuses and violence continued under Suu Kyi’s civilian government.Some analysts say Myanmar is now closer than ever to achieving that goal of defeating the junta.“The important thing to be clear about is that a genocidal military can be defeated outright… That there’s not a need to have another 10 years of a so-called transition that is fundamentally premised or corrupted by the idea that you have to negotiate and accommodate a genocidal military,” said Arnold.And there is cautious optimism among those fighting.“In order to get to a federal democratic country for equal rights, we have become stronger by coordinating with each other,” said Bo Nagar.“With this kind of unity, I believe we can quickly defeat the bullying military. And when it’s over, this kind of unity will be a foundation to rebuilding our country.”",13345,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/asia/myanmar-nationwide-offensive-junta-intl-hnk/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point torture news manpower genocidal pass nation possible allied loss bangladesh significant peace south optimism check important headquarters unity existential back dedicate prepared clear kayah medium collapse battalion kyi mountainous witness analysis turn arnold analyst paper yangon affair objective ceasefire expose conflict nationwide ground monitoring north million entire change ultimately government late influence serve form violence ally closer time economic tactic goal maintain focus april bombed pla spokesperson democratic cnn rare revolutionary destroyed long big security ensure declare call community city ocha report nagar gamble claim lose easy october brutal vowed plague southern aim china asian shwe particularly split mndaa attack continued mount unpopular thailand measure refugee coordination happen revenue suggest challenge command opening university matupi anger desire rag billion broke date arm brutality capability combat tian rebel escalation crackdown currently believe rely eradicate safeguard bullying retake mountain west resupply outpost present indian liberation effort civil hnamte target thai comment daily displacement relentless begin strong border haw mizoram lalmalsawma protect front clash early protester training official disrupt democracy february catalyze artillery theater told mark prepare accommodate pauktaw calculus council movement conduct annual terrorist mandalay online despite abuse give coup surrender child soldier weapon experience humanitarian flee phase refusal sovereignty briefly battlefield risk sanction inability injury resolute intense stronghold reform saturday martial positive reality ease pariah colonel negotiate decade kill commit institution significantly arakan camp progress nationality control commonly barely neighbor local territory establish brotherhood rakhine scatter join rural defend group chief engage multiple strategic body century reportedly position internal federal warn troop widespread northeast staff sustain support trade intervene top india align lull push minority lack strategy outcome host threat resistance loses suu region source cross acknowledge ethnic illegal emergency administration moment independently regularly corrupt capital displace united drill trafficked ongoing chinese center make rise great year burma myint military retain oppressive act burnt equal safety geopolitical fear kokang abruptly swe successive part order coordinate include small quickly battle impose power civilian myriad junta spoke evidence hit aung personnel property western compound offensive road unfolded brass straightforward seize fierce wider mass operation extensive atrocity ultimate sack alongside start accord involve rid threaten entrench sexual deny institute newly side invest zone impact november posse renew peaceful premise allege muse encounter distract labor dozen outnumber independent san certainty document meeting shift idea rebuild loikaw redeployment stability office commander unprecedented achieve full fall initial substantial reinforce relative bring equilibrium rule predict station win receive scale defensive sagaing cut junli hlaing bloody adequate subject bnra wilson heavy elect army fake fresh myanmar limit central column boom tnla attend assault fellow township vital launch country southeast unlike force transition state continuously fundamentally president kind airstrikes stretch global northern assert national work outsized militia life urban democratically powerful wave massacre cautious period town resolutely jungle aa film hold police hein ushered retreat matthew dot rape drag relation notably reach defection foundation hilly recruiting alliance half actively opportunity regional amount investment major deeply publish karenni public heavyweight lead show airstrike transport lin fraud law servant video access sufficient spur defense naypyidaw temporary besieging effectively fighter exile respond county case kunlong myo grow senior incident treat week verify favor concern route abbot advance thousand defeat recent key area trap fight chin deeper human reuters nan swiftly manage ang internationally village,-0.991,0.2472836268265267,12.107022900763354,0.3443213965754951,0,2023-11-28
CNN,New Zealand’s new government scraps world-leading smoking ban to fund tax cuts,2023-11-28 02:45:00,Heather Chen,"As any smoker will tell you, quitting tobacco isn’t easy – and it’s something New Zealand’s new government just isn’t prepared to do right now.A year after passing a world-leading smoking ban designed to save thousands of lives and prevent new generations of young adults from smoking, New Zealand has announced a u-turn to help pay for tax cuts, infuriating public health officials and anti-tobacco groups.Introduced last year, the anti-smoking law banned the sale of tobacco to anyone born or after January 1, 2009.The legislation was due to be implemented by July 2024 and would have included harsh penalties for violations such as fines of up to NZ$150,000 ($96,000).The country’s new Prime Minister Chris Luxon, whose conservative National Party entered a coalition alliance with the populist New Zealand First party and the libertarian ACT New Zealand party following elections in October, defended the controversial move, saying he disagreed with parts of the policy and argued that a ban would result in a black-market boom.Luxon said smoking rates in the country had been on the decline and reiterated that he remained committed to reducing tobacco use.Speaking to CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand, Luxon said his government would continue education programs and “encourage people to take up vapes as a cessation tool.”New Zealand’s initial smoking ban was hailed by public health officials around the world.Months after New Zealand’s announcement, Britain also unveiled plans to phase out smoking for new generations.A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that the British government remained committed to phasing out smoking, even after New Zealand’s reversal. “We are committed to that,” the spokesperson said. “This is an important long term decision and step to deliver a smoke free generations.”New Zealand’s new finance minister Nicola Willis on Saturday said the measures would be axed before March 2024, with revenue generated from cigarette sales going towards tax cuts.Smoking leads to more than eight million deaths globally each year, according to the World Health Organization – with one in four people across the world using tobacco.Smoking rates in New Zealand, already among the world’s lowest, have been falling and were at their lowest since records began, experts noted, with an estimated 56,000 smokers quitting in 2022.New Zealand’s policy reversal drew shock and condemnation from public health officials and anti-tobacco groups, who criticized the new government for prioritizing the economy and the tobacco industry ahead of human lives.Ayeshea Verrall, the country’s former health minister told CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand that reversing the ban “flew in the face” of the previous government and would set the country back a long way.“What’s going on here is that we had a set of measures that would have substantially reduced smoking, was modelled to save 80,000 lives and they’ve (the new government) have reversed it – and they’re doing it just to fund tax cuts,” Verrall said.The anti-smoking group Health Coalition Aotearoa (HCA) expressed disappointment at the new coalition’s plans to repeal the smoking ban.“This is a major loss for public health, and a huge win for the tobacco industry whose profits will be boosted at the expense of Kiwi lives,” the group said in a statement, adding that there was still massive support from New Zealanders for the world-leading smoke-free amendments.“Turning the tide on harmful products that are entrenched in society cannot be done by individuals or even communities,” HCA said. “It takes good – and brave – population level policies.”",3641,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/asia/new-zealand-smoking-ban-reversal-intl-hnk/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International

CNN,Elephant herd tramples car after baby struck along Malaysian highway,2023-11-28 00:45:00,Heather Chen,"A herd of wild elephants in Malaysia trampled on a car traveling along a major highway after it struck a baby in their group, local authorities said Monday.The car, a white Perodua Axia, was being driven by a 48-year-old man, along with his wife and son, 23, according to a statement issued by police in Gerik, in the Malay Peninsula.The family of three were driving on a major highway from the island of Penang to the northeastern coastal state of Terengganu at around 7.35 p.m. local time on Sunday, when it crashed into the elephant calf.It had been drizzling and foggy at that time, Gerik Police added, and the car was “negotiating a left bend on the highway” when it hit the baby elephant.“The car slammed into the young elephant that was walking on the road with the herd,” said Zulkifli Mahmood, Chief Superintendent at Gerik District Police. The calf fell to the ground upon impact, he added.“Seeing this, the other (five) elephants rushed towards the car and started trampling it.”The herd then left the area after the calf “got back up,” Mahmood said.Gerik Police did not specify if the three family members had been inside the car during the incident but no deaths or serious injuries were reported in the police statement.Photos provided showed extensive damage to the front and sides of the white vehicle, with its side doors caved in. All windows were also smashed.Authorities did not provide further updates about the condition of the elephant baby.As a result of Malaysia’s rapid development of highways, wild elephants across the peninsula have lost large amounts of forest cover, forcing many to venture out to roads to find food, conservationists say.In the latest accident, Gerik police warned drivers to exercise more caution on highways as herds of elephants regularly roam the area.Signs warning drivers of elephant crossings are also put up along many highways, particularly in the country’s north but accidents have still occured.In 2017, a baby elephant was discovered dead on the side of a highway, apparently killed by a car believed to have been speeding, elephant conservation group Management and Ecology of Malaysian Elephants (MEME) said at the time.Other elephant encounters are also reported on several highways.In May 2022, a lone adult elephant was spotted walking along a highway also in the Gerik area. Videos shared on social media showed the elephant ambling past bewildered drivers.In 2020, a distressed adult elephant trampled on a car that had been traveling on the same highway as the latest incident. The elephant was believed to have panicked after several vehicles started honking at it, local authorities said at the time.",2671,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/asia/elephant-baby-malaysia-highway-accident/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,crossing malay meme left driven social regularly adult bewilder herd inside apparently believe country gerik force honk rush back state elephant specify result medium large ecology malaysia sunday dead island front coastal ground food north forest add development management late statement travel hit cover damage speed police superintendent conservationist time drizzle crashed lone panicked walk young put update death road terengganu drive cave district trample extensive caution find discover amble injury baby start accord accident provide highway family amount major authority side share driver calf show member video car impact report wild negotiate lose kill mahmood struck past encounter vehicle foggy axia incident white particularly issue local slam northeastern group chief wife spot venture penang fell malaysian area peninsula distressed warn conservation perodua bend condition exercise rapid zulkifli window roam,-0.99025,0.5615874204417821,10.693959183673464,0.2839851325145443,0,2023-11-28
CNN,"Deal reached to extend Israel-Hamas truce by two days, Qatar says",2023-11-27 19:20:00,Mostafa Salem,"The truce that saw the return of 50 Israeli women and children from captivity in Gaza, as well as dozens of other nationals, has been extended for two more days, officials said Monday, as the hard-negotiated initial four-day pause concluded successfully following a late-night release of captives.Eleven Israelis were freed by Hamas on Monday, the Red Cross and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, bringing the total number of freed hostages to 69. Thirty-three Palestinian prisoners were also freed, bringing the total number of Palestinian women and children released from Israeli prisons over the course of the truce to 150. Several dozen truckloads of aid were also able to reach the besieged enclave in what had been the first respite for Palestinians in the nearly two months of war.Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari confirmed the extension of the truce in a statement posted on X, with leaders in Israel and the US quickly welcoming the news.Hamas said it agreed with Qatar and Egypt to extend the truce for an additional two days “under the same conditions reached before.”Mark Regev, the senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, confirmed to CNN’s Dana Bash that a two-day extension had been reached, adding that it would go into effect after Monday’s hostage transfer was completed.Regev said that under the agreement, Hamas will release 10 hostages each day.“For every 10 hostages released, we’re willing to give an extension of another day, and if Hamas will release Israeli hostages as agreed, we will extend — that’s the bottom line,” Regev said.Regev said he believes the hostages released over the next two days would be women and children.“My understanding is that there’s still enough women and children in Gaza held by Hamas for the next 20 (releases),” Regev said.Regev credited US President Joe Biden for helping arrange the parameters of the deal.“These were negotiated with the help of President Biden and we thank him for putting his effort and his office behind these arrangements. I don’t think we would have reached the deal without his input,” he said.In a statement, Biden praised the extension and said he has been “deeply engaged” as the truce has played out. He went on to thank the leaders of Israel, Qatar, and Egypt “for their commitment to this process and in reaching the agreement for an extension.”“We will not stop until all of the hostages held by Hamas terrorists are released,” he added.The White House also said they “hope to see” the pause extended further.The announcement followed a call Monday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the prime minister of Qatar, who helped broker the original four-day truce, according to a source familiar with the discussions.The initial deal to secure the release of 50 women and children hostages was struck with the understanding that the cessation in fighting could be extended by additional days if Hamas was able to produce additional hostages, as CNN has previously reported.Israeli and US officials believed that there were more women and children being held in captivity than 50, but agreed to the terms of the deal as Hamas insisted that it needed to use the pause in fighting to gather up additional hostages.Two American women abducted by Hamas on October 7 are believed to still be in captivity, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told CNN Monday.The White House had said three Americans were expected to be among the 50 hostages that Hamas would release over the course of the four-day pause, but only one – four-year-old Abigail Edan – was freed in the first period of truce. It was not immediately clear why the two women had not yet been released, and whether they would be released during the two-day extension.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the prime minister of Qatar held a call with President Biden.

CNN,How Cape Town is learning to live with baboons,2023-11-27 09:42:00,Callum Sutherland,"On the outskirts of Cape Town an unusual resident can often be found rummaging through rubbish bins and around back yards. The chacma baboon, native to southern Africa, has become quite familiar with the urban setting.Most of these primates spend the majority of their time in the hills and slopes on Cape Town’s periphery. However, their traditional feeding grounds are on the flatter lowground, right where the suburban sprawl has arrived in recent decades.This has created an urban conflict, with many human residents unhappy with the presence of the primates.Baboon researcher Esme Beamish, from Cape Town University’s Institute for Communities and Wildlife in Africa, explains that it makes sense for the monkeys to venture into the city in search of food. “Our environments are enticing not only because of the excess food that we have, the lush gardens and the bins, but also play spaces [for baboons],” she says.“Even if we had the perfect baboon proofing of urban areas, they would still be attracted.”Easy access to food from Cape Town’s bins means baboons can spend less time and energy foraging, and more on socializing with potential mates and the rest of their group, adds Beamish.However, there are consequences for baboons and humans alike. Some baboons have come into conflict with residents and their pets. Whilst looking for food, others have ruined farmers’ and local winemakers’ crops.Beamish is concerned for the monkeys’ welfare. “[Baboons] come into contact with dogs, motorcars and electric power lines. These are some of the major causes of death and injury,” she says.“What we now have is … not a very healthy population. They’ve got skin conditions because they’re spending too much time in bins. They’ve got appalling teeth.”The local council and residents have previously attempted to mitigate these issues by reducing food waste and using “baboon-proof” bins, as well as fences that were introduced in 2013 to keep baboons out.In some instances, residents have resorted to shooting the monkeys with pellet guns and particularly aggressive, or “problematic,” baboons have been euthanized.The presence of baboons on the city’s streets has fallen slightly, but some people fear the animal could disappear from the surrounding natural areas if it is pushed too far. The city announced in September plans to construct more fences to keep baboons confined to more rural areas.The initial plans suggest erecting fences at a number of sites along the top of Cape Peninsula, a natural habitat for the animals, and more fences have been proposed along the edge of suburbs in west Cape Town. By reducing access to these bountiful areas, the hope is that more baboons will remain on the hillsides.Jenni Trethowan, founder of conservation group Baboon Matters, agrees that keeping the primates apart from humans is the best thing for both. “By continuing to make it difficult, hopefully the baboons will decide ‘meh, lets just stay up here,” she says.",2969,https://www.cnn.com/world/africa/baboons-cape-town-scn-c2e-spc/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,founder hill population fence yard problematic environment habitat flatter pellet esme difficult traditional feed shoot announce trethowan attempt farmer forage lowground concerned make periphery arrive west skin africa back matter excess construct wildlife fear researcher mate instance garden surround baboon reduce conflict potential ground electric food slope site power add motorcar urban aggressive presence whilst consequence waste explains familiar town council healthy meh remain unusual sprawl time gun disappear erect slightly edge death spend ruin socialize propose spending rubbish plan entice natural injury introduce decide proof mitigate continue native beamish appal suburb community major stay confine institute city previously rest access lush agrees easy play suburban alike resident resort cape southern perfect particularly primate issue local street line chacma rural energy group winemaker welfare search september hope venture recent contact rummage area peninsula found animal bountiful human monkey conservation create condition unhappy top suggest majority fall space initial number university outskirt push,-0.57925,0.2020882452004041,9.689357142857144,0.4066743334185195,0,2023-11-27
CNN,Merriam-Webster’s 2023 word of the year is the real deal,2023-11-27 05:53:00,Lianne Kolirin,"As the all-important question of truth and facts continues to dominate current affairs, it may come as no surprise to learn that Merriam-Webster’s word of the year is “authentic.”The online dictionary says there has been a high volume of searches for the word’s definition for several years, but 2023 saw a “substantial increase,” thanks to “stories and conversations about AI, celebrity culture, identity, and social media.”The reason so many look it up is because “authentic” has several meanings, according to the announcement on the dictionary’s website, including “not false or imitation” and “true to one’s own personality, spirit, or character.”A synonym of real and actual, authentic is “clearly a desirable quality,” according to Merriam-Webster, and is often linked with expressions of identity, such as cuisine.The dictionary said it has also been a term favored by celebrities like singers Lainey Wilson, Sam Smith and Taylor Swift, who have all made headlines this year with statements about seeking their “authentic voice” and “authentic self.”Another fan is Elon Musk, who has previously said that people should be more “authentic” on social media. However, that became more of an issue earlier this year when Musk, as the new boss of Twitter, now X, got rid of the trademark blue check sign of authenticity - now only available at a price.The rise of artificial intelligence has blurred the lines between what is real and what is not, leaving celebrities, brands and social media influencers - among others - keen to prove their authenticity.One of the other words to stand out in searches this year, according to the dictionary, was the closely related “deepfake.”This is defined by Merriam-Webster as “an image or recording that has been convincingly altered and manipulated to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something that was not actually done or said.”There was a particular spike in searches for the term in April and early May, the dictionary said, when Musk’s lawyers argued that he shouldn’t have to give legal testimony about public statements he made as some of these may have been deepfakes. The argument was rejected. One of the most notable news stories of the year about deepfake images was of those appearing to show former President Donald Trump being detained by police in a dramatic fashion back in March.In 2022, Merriam-Webster chose “gaslighting” as its word of the year, saying it had become a ubiquitous term in the “age of misinformation.”Other words that led much traffic to the online dictionary in 2023 included coronation, dystopian, indict and doppelgänger.Meanwhile “rizz” went straight to the “top of lookups” in September, when the example of internet-driven slang was added to the dictionary.For the uninitiated, Merriam-Webster explained: “As a noun, rizz means ‘romantic appeal or charm’ (as in ‘a bro who has rizz’); as a verb (typically used with up, as in ‘rizz up that cutie’) it means ‘to charm or seduce.’”",2973,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/world/merriam-websters-2023-word-scli-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story news fashion personality image typically leave wilson high artificial social gaslighting seek lookup cutie influencers uninitiated indict swift spike trademark check make rise real sign brand detain authenticity year voice traffic reject back medium celebrity ubiquitous president verb include bos rizz affair alter early related singer age dominate add slang announcement dystopian statement conversation elon reason police spirit online give closely surprise noun lainey link blur april manipulate misrepresent coronation volume trump former website appeal romantic argument accord continue lawyer rid taylor define word argue twitter intelligence synonym keen public actual expression previously show lead meaning chose charm dictionary current available testimony quality donald straight definition term identity authentic truth earlier legal favor issue line particular search september explain sam convincingly culture fact prove deepfake learn desirable increase dramatic imitation blue smith false question x musk top seduce stand notable substantial record headline deepfakes,0.96395,0.1009081735620585,9.128219178082194,0.4253687821612349,0,2023-11-27
Fox News,US Navy responds to distress call after Israeli-owned tanker seized off coast of Yemen,2023-11-26 19:11:00,Bradford Betz,"A U.S. Navy vessel responded to a distress call Sunday from an Israeli-linked tanker off the coast of Yemen on Sunday and was later fired upon, Fox News has learned.U.S. Navy personnel from the USS Mason, a Mayport-based Arleigh Burke class destroyer assigned to the Eastern Mediterranean, responded to the distress call from the Liberian-flagged Central Park, carrying a cargo of phosphoric acid in the Gulf of Aden.The vessel is managed by Zodiac Maritime, a London-based international ship management company owned by Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer's Zodiac Group.A Zodiac spokesperson told Fox News Digital the vessel issued a distress call around 6 a.m. UTC Sunday morning stating it was under attack by suspected pirates while transiting the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTV) some 54 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia.In an undated photo released by Zodiac Maritime, the tanker Central Park is seen. Attackers seized the tanker linked to Israel off the coast of Aden, Yemen, on Sunday, Nov. 26, 2023, authorities said. (Zodiac Maritime via AP)Sources told Fox that five armed gunmen seized the tanker after boarding from a skiff by pulling up alongside the tanker. The crew locked themselves in the Citadel.The gunmen tried to beat down the door to the safe room before exiting the ship and making their way back to the shores of Yemen.U.S. Navy personnel pursued the subjects, firing warning shots as a U.S. helicopter gunship flew overhead. A Japanese destroyer assisted the USS Mason with the interdiction. The subjects were arrested and are now being questioned by the U.S. military under counter-piracy authorities.Two senior U.S. officials told Fox News Digital that Houthi forces fired two ballistic missiles at the USS Mason following the arrest. The USS Mason tracked the ballistic missiles as they approached, but both missiles fell short, splashing in the Gulf of Aden.Zodiac said the vessel ""is safe and all of the crew, the vessel, and the cargo are unharmed.""""Zodiac Maritime’s team in London, UK have been working closely with international naval coalition partners in the region today,"" the company spokesperson said. ""We would like to thank the coalition forces who responded quickly, protecting assets in the area and upholding international maritime law.""BBC EDITOR WHO FALSELY REPORTED ON GAZA HOSPITAL BOMBING SPEAKS OUTWhile no group immediately claimed responsibility, it comes as at least two other maritime attacks in recent days have been linked to the Israel-Hamas war.Nearby Aden is held by forces allied to Yemen's internationally recognized government and a Saudi-led coalition that has battled Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels for years. That part of the Gulf of Aden in theory is under the control of those forces and is fairly distant from Houthi-controlled territory in the country. Somali pirates also are not known to operate in that area.This photo released by the Houthi Media Center shows Houthi escort the cargo ship Galaxy Leader on Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023. Y (Houthi Media Center via AP)Zodiac Maritime has been targeted previously amid a wider yearslong shadow war between Iran and Israel. In 2021, a drone attack assessed by the U.S. and other Western nations to have been carried out by Iran killed two crew members aboard Zodiac's oil tanker Mercer Street off the coast of Oman.The Central Park seizure comes after a container ship, CMA CGM Symi, owned by another Israeli billionaire came under attack Friday by a suspected Iranian drone in the Indian Ocean. Iran has not acknowledged carrying out the attack.The attacks, meanwhile, come as global shipping increasingly finds itself targeted in the weekslong war that threatens to become a wider regional conflict — even as a truce has halted fighting and Hamas exchanges hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWith the Israel-Hamas war — which began with the militant Palestinian group's Oct. 7 attack — raging on, the Houthis seized a vehicle transport ship in the Red Sea off Yemen.",4055,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-navy-responds-distress-call-israeli-owned-tanker-seized-coast-yemen,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cgyUI9sP8zj7Zhf5tpOI2wHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cgyUI9sP8zj7Zhf5tpOI2wHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,news billionaire partner leader truce company maritime international japanese speaks skiff region source nation acknowledge palestinian shot allied gaza increasingly undated make center outwhile year israel military back phosphoric digital somali shipping naval zodiac medium halt sunday yemen part coast symi shore conflict quickly battle pirate government management personnel missile amid western beat team pull boarding fox link seize london coalition spokesperson today wider tanker burke appwith distress find alongside iranian ocean call aboard release claimed previously gunship destroyer report aden gulf mile flew israeli arleigh nautical morning vehicle recognize arrest hamas issue street approach exit falsely bombing galaxy attack overhead attacker fell safe iran bbc fire splash photo question park weekslong responsibility helicopter rag red subject cgm arm class unharmed oil recommend hospital mercer rebel central yearslong transit gunman country force state indian houthis eastern suspect target begin global protect ballistic work militant exchange official operate corridor utc told container editor friday vessel escort carry asset pursue closely interdiction assist prisoner shadow room distant regional authority mediterranean show cma transport ship member law eyal assess navy assign lock follow theory kill respond mason senior tracked short control held territory uk threatens fairly group seizure acid ofer cargo recent area drone hostage fight warn day manage crew houthi internationally irtv immediately uphold,-0.9894,0.0739827373612823,11.533966480446924,0.169281045751634,0,2023-11-26
Fox News,"This family spent $600,000 renovating historic property. Then the government said they didn’t own it",2023-11-26 07:30:00,Jon Michael Raasch,"A house-flipping couple spent $600,000 renovating a bayside home only to be told by the Canadian Department of Justice that they couldn’t sell it, accusing the local government of illegally auctioning off the property, according to a local report.""I hate it.

The couple said they decided to buy the property for $50,000 in 2021 after a small claims court ruled that the house would be sold at auction to settle a payment dispute between the Tenniswoods and the owner.But when the couple went to sell the home after restoring it, the Justice Department barred them, filed suit against the property owners and argued that the local sheriff's department, which conducted the auction, never notified the previous owner, Mehdi Martin, his home was going up for sale, according to CTV. By then, the Tenniswoods had already sunk $600,000 into renovations.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE""We didn't feel it was a risk that wasn't going to pay us back.

Just weeks after placing the recently remodeled home on the market in July 2022, Nova Scotia's attorney general placed a hold on the property, arguing that the house didn't belong to the Tenniswoods and should be returned to its previous owner, according to CTV.The house in Hampton had its own lighthouse, which Lorna called a ""one-of-a-kind nightlight.""

After Matin failed to respond to correspondence from the sherrif's department claiming his house could be auctioned off in order to pay the Tenniswoods, the property went up for sale, the family said.""I never got those emails,"" Matin said.

CNN,"Russia launches biggest drone attack against Kyiv since start of war, Ukrainian officials say",2023-11-25 16:49:00,Jessie Yeung,"Russia on Saturday launched its largest drone attack against Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv since the start of its invasion, according to local officials.“A total of nearly 75 Shahed drones were launched from two directions – Primorsko-Akhtarsk and the Kursk region, Russia. The primary target was the city of Kyiv,” said Ukraine’s Air Force in a Telegram post, describing the attack as a “record number” of drones.It said air defenses intercepted 71 of the Iranian-made drones across six regions of Ukraine – but the vast majority of the drones were intercepted in the Kyiv region.“Anti-aircraft missile troops, tactical aviation, mobile fire groups, and electronic warfare units were involved in repelling the air attack,” said the air force. It added that a Kh-59 guided missile was also destroyed in the Dnipropetrovsk region.Mykhailo Shamanov, a spokesman for the Kyiv city military administration, described several waves of drones coming from different directions toward the capital.A CNN producer in Kyiv heard loud explosions and repeated bangs as drones buzzed overhead. The city’s military administration warned residents to take cover, saying: “A large number of enemy UAVs are entering Kyiv from different directions! We urge you to stay in shelters until the alarm goes off!”It was the fourth drone attack on Kyiv this month, according to Shamanov.At least two people were injured in Kyiv’s Solomianskyi district, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko.Several locations in Solomianskyi district caught fire, including a residential building and other non-residential premises, Klitschko said.He added that the second floor of a five-story residential building in Solomianskyi district was damaged, and that the wreckage of downed drones fell on two residential buildings – one in the Dniprovskyi district, the other in the Holosiivskyi district.In a separate statement, Serhii Popko, the head of the Kyiv city military administration, said a fire had broken out on the premises of a kindergarten after a drone was downed in the Solomianskyi district.The country’s energy ministry said this recent attack on Kyiv cut off power to an overhead line, leaving 77 residential buildings and 120 establishments without power in the city center.Ukrainian energy company DTEK announced later on Saturday that power had been restored to all Kyiv residents.Last winter, Russia carried out a sustained campaign of missile and drone attacks to cripple Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.Khmelnytskyi, in western Ukraine, has become a regular target of attacks, with the shockwaves from explosions damaging infrastructure in the region, including its nuclear power plant.“Powerful explosions” shook the area near the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant last month, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said, with shockwaves shattering windows and temporarily cutting off power to some off-site radiation monitoring stations. IAEA experts at the plant were also told that two drones were shot down in close proximity to the site.The IAEA said that the incident “once again highlighted the dangers to nuclear safety and security during the ongoing military conflict.”While concerns remain about the country’s energy this winter, DTEK has spent the last seven months restoring infrastructure, trying to boost output and bolster defenses at its facilities.“We restored what could be restored, bought back-up equipment and installed defenses around power plants,” DTEK chief executive Maxim Timchenko told CNN earlier this month.According to deputy chief of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence, Vadym Skibitsky, attacks to the country’s energy grid will be harder for Russia to pull off this time around.Citizens have also been preparing for the possibility of a downed power grid.

CNN,CNN Exclusive: Inside Ukraine’s fight for the Dnipro River,2023-11-24 07:38:00,Anna Coren,"As Serhiy Ostapenko hunkered down in his pickup truck, hiding under trees for cover in the dead of night, the crashing booms of Russian bombardment rumbled around him.“The enemy is shelling us 24 hours a day. I don’t remember the last time there was silence for more than an hour,” said the 32-year-old Ukrainian drone pilot, speaking from the right bank of the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine – one of the new frontlines in a grinding war that’s now entering its second winter.Ostapenko is a member of the “Sons of Thunder” drone unit, part of Ukraine’s operation to cross the Dnipro, pushing back Russian forces and establishing a sustained presence on the left bank. Earlier this month, Ukraine said it had “gained a foothold” on the bank, a potentially significant advance in what has so far been a lackluster counteroffensive.But during CNN’s exclusive access with Ostapenko, his night mission had just been aborted because the Russians had identified his unit’s position on the right bank – forcing them to take shelter.“That’s another one – I think it was a rocket,” he told CNN as another boom rang out, his face lit only by a dim red light. “Every time I enter this zone … I say goodbye to my life every time, because I realize that my life can be ended at any moment, because either a rocket or a shell will strike. You get used to it, but it is unpleasant.”The 2,200 kilometer (1,400 mile) long Dnipro is Europe’s fourth longest river, flowing from Russia, through Belarus and Ukraine to the Black Sea.It winds through the marshlands of Russian-occupied Kherson region – with Russian troops forced to retreat across the river last November after being pushed out from Kherson city by Ukrainian fighters.The liberation of the city, after eight months of brutal occupation, was a euphoric victory and a key moment in Ukraine’s war effort. But the year since has brought little relief, with Kherson city and its surrounding region still under relentless bombardment by Russian forces across the river.The Dnipro, which at some points stretches a mile wide, serves as a natural defensive barrier for Russian troops – which is partly why it has become a major target for Kyiv. Ukrainian forces have previously staged cross-river raids, but establishing a firm bridgehead across the river and pushing back the Russians could help better protect Kherson city by putting more distance between civilians and enemy artillery.And – at least theoretically – an advance on the left bank could give Kyiv a launching place to push further south toward occupied Crimea, the peninsula Russia illegally annexed in 2014.Ukrainian armed forces say they’ve pushed back Russian troops 3 to 8 kilometers (2 to 5 miles) back from the river.“Now our (troops) are advancing on the other side of the Dnipro. It is very difficult, we are making a lot of effort to make it possible and to build up our strength on the other side of the Dnipro,” said Ostapenko.He added that “certain connections” had been established across the river, allowing Ukrainian troops to transport “weapons, ammunition, food, fuel” to their partners “on the other side.”His aerial reconnaissance unit, meanwhile, works to provide cover for soldiers crossing the river, to surveil Russian troops and movements, and to help mask the locations of Ukrainian troops and equipment.It’s dangerous work; Ostapenko described facing a daily barrage of “kamikaze drones, I think it’s Shaheds, rockets, most likely Grad rocket launcher, mortars, and tanks.”But, he added, the bombardment could be seen as a good sign: “The enemy is trying to resist as much as possible, which indicates that we are doing everything right. We are causing them many problems, and (they are) trying to fight it.”All the while, in Kherson city, the jubilation of last year’s liberation has faded for some residents as they focus on just getting through each day.“When it is quiet, it is even scarier than when there is shelling,” said 54-year-old Inna Balyoha. “You’re waiting, you’re constantly listening, turning the radio down. So that you can hear the sounds outside the window, so that you can react in time to the shelling.”She’s one of roughly 73,000 residents still in Kherson – less than a quarter of its original population of 300,000. Between having to care for her 4-year-old grandson and frail 87-year-old mother, “the decision not to leave was made a long time ago,” she said.But living in the midst of war has taken its toll. One of her grandson’s first words was “alarm,” she said. “He knows how to react if there is an air raid siren. He knows where to go. If explosions are heard outside the window, he has a little hiding place in the hallway.”The shelling has gotten so bad that they’ve stopped going outside for short walks, mostly staying at home now. “Right now, I’m doing everything that depends on me to keep the child safe,” she said. “Our main task is to survive. That was the main task during the occupation. And it is now. We have to survive.”Attacks on Kherson have intensified in the past month, at one point reaching 700 incoming rounds in one day, according to Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of Kherson region’s military administration.Russian troops are “hitting residential areas more often because our defenders are advancing, and they are trying to intimidate ordinary citizens in places close to the Dnipro River,” said Prokudin. “This is revenge, and now it is felt more, because our soldiers are already on the left bank of the Kherson region.

CNN,Live grenade in birthday gift kills aide to Ukraine’s military chief,2023-11-07 11:49:00,Rob Picheta,"An aide to the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s military was killed after receiving a live grenade as a birthday present that was immediately detonated by his 13-year-old son.Major Gennadiy Chastyakov, who served as the assistant to Valery Zaluzhny, had received a gift box from a colleague for his birthday on Monday that contained several “Western model” grenades, Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on Telegram.Chastyakov’s 13-year-old son then picked up one of the grenades and started turning the ring, Klymenko wrote. As Chastyakov took the grenade from him, the ring was pulled out and the weapon detonated.Zaluzhny, the chief of Ukraine’s military, wrote on Telegram that his “assistant and close friend” died “under tragic circumstances.”Police found five more unexploded grenades in the apartment, Klymenko said.Kyiv regional police reported that the assistant’s son was seriously injured by the explosion, and is being medically treated.According to Klymenko, police identified the “fellow serviceman” who gave the gift to Chastyakov, and found two similar grenades during a search of his office.Police said criminal proceedings had been initiated and an investigation is ongoing, though the Ukrainian interior ministry later said it considers the death an “accident” based on preliminary information.“According to the information we have now, we can say that it was an accident, negligent ammunition handling,” Mariana Reva, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior said on national TV.“It is possible that the case will be reclassified based on the evidence collected.”The gift “was in the form of a box, with a bottle of alcohol and six grenades inside,” Reva said.She said that the colleague “presented these grenades to a colleague, pointing out that the grenades were combat grenades.”“Unfortunately, the deceased did not take these words seriously,” Reva added.Klymenko assisted Zaluzhny as the military chief led Ukrainian troops in the war with Russia.“From the beginning of the full-scale invasion, (Gennadiy) was a reliable shoulder for me, completely devoting his life to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the fight against Russian aggression,” the military chief wrote on Telegram.The assistant had a wife and four children; in addition to the son’s injuries, his daughter suffered minor injuries, according to Reva.Zaluzhny has in recent days found himself in a public difference of opinion with Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, who disputed his commander-in-chief’s characterization of the state of the war.Zaluzhny told the Economist that “we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate” and “there will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough,” comments which Zelensky’s office quickly pushed back against.",2788,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/europe/ukraine-military-chief-assistant-grenade-death-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230627130758-rob-picheta-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,reclassify pull breakthrough interior police decease proceeding word alcohol detonate weapon valery addition similar considers public colleague start gennadiy western initiate accord child bottle office kill klymenko form invasion criminal ammunition russian reach ukraine found investigation level comment technology preliminary unfortunately friend ongoing ministry injury zaluzhny handle fellow lead wife told chief possible national ukrainian president inside picked injured case evidence telegram characterization point day identify search military ring life mariana quickly unexploded push birthday force combat spokesperson give assistant write apartment present immediately serviceman live serve begin information explosion devote negligent ihor back beautiful receive recent aggression stalemate accident put monday zelensky economist minister completely fight reva suffer regional gift base turn assist death close troop box deep arm grenade contain dispute state daughter volodymyr chastyakov aide report shoulder tragic difference minor reliable model opinion medically,-0.98015,0.1076040172166427,12.076064257028111,0.3583333333333333,0,2023-11-07
CNN,"Guinea’s ex-junta leader recaptured after prison break, defense ministry says",2023-11-04 18:46:00,not specified,"The former head of Guinea’s 2008 military junta, Moussa Dadis Camara, has been recaptured following his escape from prison on Saturday, Guinea’s Ministry of Defense announced.Camara was sprung from prison by heavily armed men in Conakry in the early hours of Saturday along with three other high-ranking officers, Justice Minister Charles Wright said.Two of the three high-ranking officers — Moussa Tiegboro Camara and Blaise Gomou — have also been recaptured, according to the Ministry of Defense. The third officer, Colonel Claude Pivi, remains at large.The escapees that were recaptured are “safe and sound,” the Ministry of Defense said, and have been sent back to Maison Centrale de Conakry, a federal prison in Guinea’s capital.“All security measures have been taken to find the last fugitive,” the Ministry of Defense continued. “I once again call on citizens to continue to freely go about their daily business.”Earlier Saturday, local residents told Reuters military vehicles and special forces were policing the streets of the Guinean capital after shots were heard in the Kaloum administrative district, where Camara and others were held at the Central House prison.“It was around 05:00 a.m. (01:00 a.m. ET) that heavily armed men burst into the Central House of Conakry. They managed to leave with four defendants in the trial of the events of Sept. 28 including Captain Moussa Dadis Camara,” the minister said on the radio.“They will be found wherever they are,” he said, declining to give further details of the investigation.Guinea’s borders have been closed to prevent the escapees fleeing the country, he said.Camara and others have been on trial since last year, accused of orchestrating a stadium massacre and mass rape by Guinean security forces in which 150 people were killed during a pro-democracy rally on September 28, 2009.Camara has denied responsibility, blaming the atrocities on errant soldiers.Residents near Kaloum said shots were first heard around 04:00 a.m. local time (12:00 a.m. ET) after which security was tightened on the streets and the entrance to Kaloum was blocked.By late morning, the capital appeared calm with many soldiers still visible in some areas, ordering people to stay at home, Mmah Camara, a resident of Tombo district, said by phone.Guinea is governed by military leader Mamady Doumbouya, who took power in a coup in 2021 - one of eight in West and Central Africa in the last three years.

CNN,Blackpink Lisa’s Chinese social media page suspended after Paris burlesque routine,2023-11-03 05:23:00,Chris Lau,"Blackpink star Lisa’s Weibo page appears to have been taken down, weeks after she performed a burlesque routine in Paris that sparked a huge debate on China’s tightly regulated internet.On Wednesday afternoon, the Thai star’s verified account @lalalalisa_m was no longer searchable on the site, one of China’s most popular social media networks.“The account can longer be viewed because it has received complaints of breaches of law and regulations, as well as relevant rules from the Weibo Community Management Regulations,” her replacement page stated.It is not clear what types of complaint she has received but China’s web companies routinely suspend or remove pages that breach the country’s myriad censorship rules – or that simply generate too much controversy.The suspension of her account comes after Lisa performed five shows in September at the Crazy Horse Paris, one of the French capital’s top burlesque venues.Videos of her performances shared on social media stirred controversy however in some parts of Asia, such as China, where more conservative attitudes often prevail.CNN has reached out to Weibo and the star’s record label YG Entertainment for comment.Weibo accounts of Blackpink’s other members – Jisoo, Jennie, and Rose – remain online.K-Pop supergroup Blackpink rose to international fame after debuting in 2016. The group headlined Coachella this year and has collaborated with US singers such as Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez.Lisa – the only girl in the group without Korean heritage – has gained a large following in China, having appeared as a coach in a Chinese reality dance show.In China there was a fierce debate on Weibo between users who questioned Lisa’s decision to associate herself with Crazy Horse and those who supported her show.“Lisa is given very good resources. Why did she choose the Crazy Horse show?,” one Weibo user wrote.Another said her account should have been taken down sooner. “She was still very high-profile on Weibo after attending the Crazy Horse show,” the user wrote.Others lamented the disappearance of her Weibo page.“I may have also criticized her for the Crazy Horse show.

CNN,Revisiting a key video used to assess the Gaza hospital blast,2023-11-02 16:05:00,Yong Xiong,"A video cited by Israel and the United States as part of their assessments of the deadly Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital blast in Gaza on October 17 does not appear to be directly related to the explosion, according to a CNN analysis of several videos that builds on previous reporting.CNN revisited the footage broadcast live by Al Jazeera on the night of the explosion to better understand what has been considered a key piece of evidence. While the new analysis adds to the evolving picture of what happened, it does not alter CNN’s earlier findings that the blast was likely caused by a malfunctioning rocket, not an Israeli airstrike.After analyzing additional videos filmed from multiple angles, CNN was able to determine that the projectile captured in the Al Jazeera broadcast was likely fired from inside Israel, not from Gaza, as was previously concluded, and unlikely to have any connection to the explosion at Al-Ahli, miles away.Open-source researchers @ArchieIrving2 and @OAlexanderDK on X, formerly known as Twitter, were the first to triangulate the footage and geolocate the likely launch site to Israel. The New York Times and The Washington Post also reached the same conclusion in recent reports.In the immediate aftermath of the blast, CNN initially reviewed dozens of videos posted on social media, aired on live broadcasts and filmed by a freelance journalist working for CNN in Gaza, as well as satellite imagery, to piece together what happened at the hospital complex in as much detail as possible.The open-source imagery showed a huge explosion and destruction from the fire at the hospital complex, which experts said was consistent with a failed rocket crashing to the ground with unspent fuel.Weapons and explosive experts with decades of experience assessing bomb damage, who reviewed the visual evidence, told CNN they believe this to be the most likely scenario – although they caution the absence of munition remnants or shrapnel from the scene made it difficult to be sure. All agreed that the available images of evidence of the damage at the site was not consistent with an Israeli airstrike.Still, no visual evidence has surfaced showing a rocket hitting the hospital, and CNN cannot exclude other possibilities. Without the ability to access the scene and gather evidence from the ground, no conclusion can be definitive.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN in a statement that the Al Jazeera video in question was never claimed as “definite proof” of its findings, which it said, “are supported by other resources and intelligence.”In an interview with CNN on October 18, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the IDF, held up a piece of paper with a screenshot of the Al Jazeera footage printed on it, claiming it showed “the rocket that fell into the hospital.”A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which produced the US government’s assessment of the hospital blast, declined to comment on CNN’s analysis of the video, or whether they stood by their own assessment.“The U.S. Intelligence Community judges that Israel was not responsible for an explosion at the Al Ahli Hospital in the Gaza Strip,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Instead, we assess that the explosion was caused by a failed rocket launched by Palestinian militants. Our assessment is based on multiple sources of information, including intelligence reporting and our evaluation of observed damage to the site.”To reassess the Al Jazeera footage, CNN reviewed three additional videos – one filmed by a cameraman on a rooftop in Gaza City, a livestream filmed from Bat Yam, a suburb of Tel Aviv, and a third filmed by CNN affiliate Israeli television station Channel 12 from the Israeli town of Netivot.By geolocating the camera positions and establishing the field of view as seen in the videos, CNN was able to determine the rocket was likely fired near the Israeli town of Nahal Oz. CNN also determined that the projectile seemed to explode in the sky near the border with Gaza, miles away from Al-Ahli Hospital, making it unlikely to have caused the blast.CNN could not independently verify the type of projectile seen in the video, but satellite imagery shows that the area estimated to be the launch location is within proximity of an Israeli military site, known to have an Iron Dome defense system. CNN could not independently assess whether what is visible in the video is in fact an Iron Dome interceptor missile. Israel says that it does not fire interceptors into Gaza.Markus Schiller, a Germany-based missile expert who has worked on analysis for NATO and the European Union, told CNN that the projectile pictured in the Al Jazeera footage “matched the profile” of a Tamir interceptor missile launched by Israel’s Iron Dome, based on its rapid change in course, followed by the mid-air explosion seconds later.“Tamir interceptors are only launched if the fully automated integrated air and missile defense system calculates a direct threat to certain areas, as to avoid intercepting missiles that hit fields, or sparsely inhabited areas,” said Schiller. “It is well possible that only a single interceptor was launched to intercept one of the missiles that went off course.”The IDF did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about whether the Iron Dome was used to intercept a rocket fired from Gaza on the evening of October 17. Jonathan Conricus, an IDF spokesman, told The Washington Post that Israel did not make any interceptions around that time.One of the videos CNN used to triangulate the Al Jazeera footage – a live shot of the Gaza Strip filmed from Bat Yam – captured a barrage of rocket fire illuminating the night sky over Gaza just before 7 p.m. The video appears to show the volley emanating from a location southwest of Al-Ahli Hospital, outside of Gaza City.Schiller said that he estimated a Qassam rocket, which are used by Palestinian militants, would have taken about 25 to 40 seconds to reach the distance from the launch site to the hospital, depending on variables like launch angle, acceleration and burn time. He added that the most likely cause of the explosion was a rocket launched towards Israel “that fell short and hit the hospital’s parking lot” just a few seconds after what he described as the “intercept” seen in the Al Jazeera footage.The location of the rocket barrage seemed to be consistent with a map released by the IDF on October 18 that it said showed rockets were launched from a site several kilometers away from the Al-Ahli hospital, from a southwesterly direction, with a trajectory towards the hospital. CNN cannot independently confirm whether a rocket fired from southwestern Gaza was responsible for the blast.Israel said that a “misfired” rocket by militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad caused the blast, a claim that US President Joe Biden said was backed up by US intelligence. A spokesperson for the National Security Council later said that analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information suggested that Israel is “not responsible.”Palestinian officials and several Arab leaders accused Israel of hitting the hospital amid its ongoing airstrikes in Gaza. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (or PIJ) – a rival group to Hamas – has denied responsibility.Until an independent investigation is allowed on the ground and evidence is collected from the site, the prospect of determining who was behind the blast is remote.",7450,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/02/middleeast/al-jazeera-video-gaza-hospital-blast-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231019155059-02-al-ahli-baptist-hospital-blast-101823.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,immediate tamir revisit satellite instead dome york malfunction reassess night screenshot trajectory distance source imagery missile profile related burn nahal detail held ahli blast parking barrage happen remnant explosive comment definite mile triangulate view broadcast build munition possible israeli picture geolocate airstrikes scene union yam inhabit believe image defense absence government fell determine oalexanderdk cnn reporting washington city decade acceleration rival print explode european estimate difficult initially emanate geolocating threat southwestern spokesperson assessment idf x footage social biden follow fire exclude volley available back official conricus recent confirm deadly nato interceptor southwesterly launch jazeera access type overhead claim part amid independent map group base cameraman film possibility integrate security shrapnel intercept additional palestinian unspent sparsely field lerner produce judge release add leader expert projectile direct gaza baptist site directly arab medium freelance understand single affiliate jonathan visual evolve interception suggest work match gather council responsible proximity hospital israel southwest earlier decline tel militant short joe include review evaluation post fact complex paper assess surface scenario accord office schiller consistent strip interview described system angle oz sky hamas analysis depend reach investigation fully rapid television twitter formerly ongoing director request border told key intelligence national analyze calculates ground president away inside evidence misfire position claimed location spokesman lot crash fail researcher alter islamic remote air military consider destruction establish respond change conclude force rooftop accuse shot prospect conclusion avoid qassam question aviv rocket ass direction journalist united finding channel live statement information explosion course pij huge iron support capture resource october dozen independently previously area collect experience damage video visible time verify jihad proof agree connection kilometer stood hit aftermath show suburb ability deny multiple variable community observe automate illuminate previous camera caution make station town bomb piece state livestream,-0.897,0.1208053691275167,11.103720238095235,0.4080253427128428,0,2023-11-02
