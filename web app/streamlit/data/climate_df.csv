Washington Post,Two people were killed by sharks in encounters that are very rare,2023-12-05 15:38:00,Allyson Chiu,"Two people died after apparent encounters with sharks in recent days, sparking renewed concerns about the risk of being bitten by the animal.A woman died over the weekend in Mexico after suffering an injury that local officials said appeared to be caused by a shark bite. Another woman visiting the Bahamas from Boston died Monday after being struck by a shark while paddleboarding less than a mile from shore.But experts are urging the public to stay calm.“It is absolutely horrible when you hear about these fatal interactions,” said James Sulikowski, a professor at Oregon State University and director of the Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station. “But these are such rare events, and they’re so polarizing, that I think people need to take a step back and look at how rare they really are.”Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s Florida Program for Shark Research, agreed, calling shark bites “amazingly rare.”“If sharks targeted people, I tell people there’d be 10,000 shark bites a day,” he said. “They’re doing their very best to avoid people.”Here’s what to know about shark bites.“No,” said Naylor, who oversees the Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File, which documents shark bites. “We don’t see any statistical evidence for it.”In 2022, there were 57 confirmed cases of unprovoked bites worldwide, which was lower than the most recent five-year average of 70 incidents annually, according to the database. The figures for 2023 aren’t officially public yet, but Naylor said the numbers will be slightly higher than last year.Still, he said this year’s cases aren’t unusual when compared to long-term trends and noted that 2022 appeared to be a lull.“This year is no different than average years,” he said.As far as risks of severe injury or death go, shark bites have long been low on the list of things people should be worried about, Sulikowski said. By one count, you’re more likely to die falling into a hole at the beach, in a riptide or in an alligator attack than you are from a shark bite, The Washington Post’s Teddy Amenabar reported.“If sharks wanted to put us on the menu, there would be a lot more of us disappearing,” Sulikowski said. “That’s just not happening.”Shark bites, he added, often tend to be unfortunate mistakes.“They get confused, and the person is in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said.Experts say much remains unknown about the movements of sharks and where they spend their time. But it’s not all that unusual for the marine animals to venture fairly close to shore, Naylor said.“They have long been coming in intermittently, but people haven’t realized this,” he said. “The number of people that are really, really close to sharks when they’re swimming and don’t realize it is staggering.”Awareness of these previously unknown close encounters may be growing due to an increase in the use of monitoring technology such as drones, which have produced viral footage of unsuspecting swimmers or surfers in the water near sharks.“Electronics and drones have made people realize that they come closer,” Naylor said.Research into how shark populations are shifting as the ocean warms is still in its infancy, Sulikowski said.“What we do know is that sharks look for certain environments, and if their food is in those environments, then they’re going to be there,” he said. “If the food is shifting because of climate change … the sharks are going to follow that.”There have been anecdotal reports of some species of sharks moving to places where they typically haven’t been seen before. It’s possible, Naylor said, that these changes could lead to more interactions between sharks and people.“Shark bites are just the consequence of people being in the water where sharks are in the water,” he said. “If that probability goes up, then the incidence of these very rare events will also go up.”But fearing the animals isn’t the answer.“When we enter an environment like this, which is the sharks’ home, and this is where they live, this is where they eat … we have to kind of expect that the unknown and unthinkable may happen,” Sulikowski said. “But it’s extremely, extremely rare, and there are other things to worry about.”",4231,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/05/shark-attacks-bites-humans-explained/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,apparent amenabar closer increase infancy change worldwide environment sulikowski beach home unusual amazingly time average happen unknown remains fear swimmer oversees public electronics swim drone stay marine mexico lot high water fairly accord note bite unprovoked monitoring report hear boston coastal concern bahamas animal live worry confirm database close file risk bitten riptide intermittently polarize history climate mile person professor target probability shore venture paddleboarding shift number teddy follow natural alligator day disappear renew spend james hole museum interaction director make grow enter incidence urge specie extremely trend expert technology long due suffer case attack produce monday worried surfer movement wrong possible avoid absolutely naylor international footage warms research document event station year state menu consequence population step program move oregon severe weekend kind florida official back low woman local expect fall annually incident recent ocean awareness gavin different place fatal compare encounter experiment death unsuspecting agree food count realize lead viral list shark slightly unfortunate injury officially anecdotal figure previously post confuse tend spark struck typically call statistical horrible rare unthinkable evidence put washington eat add visit university,-0.99035,0.0709052233514535,7.709976905311777,0.5496223316912972,0,2023-12-05
NPR,Oil firms are out in force at the climate talks. Here's how to decode their language,2023-12-05 05:05:00,Camila Domonoske,"Sultan al-Jaber is the president of this year's climate talks and the head of the UAE's state-run oil company. Oil companies have a big platform at the climate conference, and experts say their language is important because it can make it into policy. Ryan Lim/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Sultan al-Jaber is the president of this year's climate talks and the head of the UAE's state-run oil company. Oil companies have a big platform at the climate conference, and experts say their language is important because it can make it into policy. Just a few years ago, oil companies said they felt unwelcome at United Nations climate talks. Not this year. This year's climate conference is taking place in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producing country that's looking to increase its oil production. And the oil industry has a big platform at the talks. The oil cartel OPEC has its own pavilion at this meeting, known as COP28, and giant oil companies are playing a prominent role, to the dismay of climate activists. So what are oil producers saying in their pledges and statements about climate change? And what does it actually mean? Most oil companies acknowledge that climate change is real. Yet they also argue strongly for the world's continued use of massive quantities of fossil fuels, which power both the global economy and their profits. But climate scientists say it's crucial to cut fossil fuel use sharply to avoid some of the worst effects of global warming. ""It's important to consider what these companies are committing to, what policies they support,"" says Paasha Mahdavi, associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, noting that oil companies' language can make it into policy. ""Language is very revealing."" But this language isn't always straightforward. Here are five key, but sometimes confusing, phrases about climate change commonly used by oil companies — and why they matter. ""Carbon,"" short for carbon dioxide, is at the heart of climate talks. Most carbon dioxide emissions come from burning oil, gas and coal — and they heat the planet. Many oil companies talk about their support for ""low carbon energy"" and ""lower carbon energy."" ""We believe the future of energy is lower carbon,"" Chevron, an NPR sponsor, frequently emphasizes in ads and speeches. Mahdavi says the focus should be on the words ""low"" or ""lower."" It doesn't mean no carbon emissions, he says. He says when companies push for more ""lower carbon energy,"" it typically means continuing to produce and use oil and gas — but with somewhat cleaner extraction and processing methods. ""You're just doing it with fewer emissions, but the end product still can have a lot of carbon in it,"" Mahdavi says. For Chevron and other companies investing in ""lower carbon"" initiatives, the phrase sometimes refers to cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, like getting energy from heat inside the Earth. More often, it describes cleaning up the production and use of fossil fuels. That includes reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, during fossil fuel extraction. This past weekend, a group of oil companies (though not Chevron) announced a pledge to reduce their methane emissions — but scientists say that is only accounting for a small fraction of overall emissions from oil and gas. Or another key technology in the ""low carbon"" energy bucket is called ""carbon capture and storage."" That refers to capturing carbon pollution from fossil fuel production and industry, injecting it underground, and storing it before it reaches the atmosphere. But experts say carbon capture technology isn't fully proven: projects often haven't reduced as much emissions as they said they would and are often over budget. Climate scientists say that carbon capture can't reduce the bulk of emissions, and really reducing carbon requires using less fossil fuels. A ""carbon capture"" gas plant breaks ground in September 2023 in England. The plant is a joint venture between oil companies BP and Equinor. Carbon capture is a technology that is sometimes associated with ""low"" or ""lower carbon"" energy.

Carbon capture is a technology that is sometimes associated with ""low"" or ""lower carbon"" energy. ""Unabated fossil fuels."" It's a wonky phrase that will come up a lot at this year's climate talks. That's because much of the conference involves a big push from countries to reduce or get rid of ""unabated fossil fuels."" This past weekend, the U.S. joined other nations in a pledge to phase out ""unabated"" coal. That might sound a lot like eliminating fossil fuels. But, again, notice the word ""unabated."" It describes emissions from coal, oil or gas that go straight into the atmosphere and heat up the planet. Oil companies instead focus on ""abating"" emissions from producing and using fossil fuels, which means stopping at least some of the emissions from entering the atmosphere. The industry argues that carbon capture and storage — that ""low-carbon"" technology with a poor track record of success — could accomplish this. Experts have major concerns. ExxonMobil, which is also a sponsor of NPR, has promos on NPR programming that tout carbon capture. (NPR has strict separations between the news division and its sponsorship unit. When asked about these sponsorships, an NPR spokesperson noted that ""NPR has no list of sources from which funding will be refused. However, conflicts of interest or similar concerns are considered."") What the world decides around these words — abated or unabated — has huge implications for oil and gas producers. If the world's leaders decide to only phase out ""unabated"" fossil fuels, that would theoretically allow for oil production to continue indefinitely, if combined with new pollution trapping and storage technology.

Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Chevron CEO Mike Wirth at an energy conference in Houston in March 2023. Chevron and other oil companies often speak of ""lower carbon"" energy, but that doesn't always mean no carbon. Many oil companies have spotlighted something called a ""net zero"" ambition. The whole world, in fact, set a ""net zero"" target at the climate talks in Paris eight years ago. What ""net zero emissions"" means is that the pollution humans produce that is heating the planet would get canceled out by removing the same amount of emissions from the atmosphere. That can be done by planting trees or building giant machines to pull carbon from the sky. But those can compensate for only a small fraction of the carbon dioxide people emit today. Reaching true ""net zero"" requires cutting global emissions enormously, scientists say. But ""net zero"" can be a slippery phrase. Some oil companies setting ""net zero"" targets are referring only to the emissions in their operations — not to the emissions from the oil they sell. So they might use solar panels and wind turbines to power oil drilling rigs and consider their ""net zero"" goals met, even as the oil they produce releases vast quantities of carbon pollution when it's burned as gasoline or jet fuel. Reducing emissions from oil production is an important part of the climate fight, and more companies need to focus on this, climate experts say. But it's not enough to meet the world's net zero goals – which are the objective of the U.N.'s climate talks happening now. That will require using far less oil in the first place, according to these experts. Fossil fuel companies often mention ""reliable and affordable energy"" in ads and speeches. They're not normally referring to cleaner energies like wind and solar, however. In fact, it's usually shorthand for oil and gas, says Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, an energy consultancy with clients that include big oil companies. ""The reason that we're 80% dependent on fossil fuels is because it is reliable, it's affordable, and it's secure,"" he says. ""Reliable,"" ""affordable"" and ""secure"" often work as digs at renewable energy. Reliable: A common talking point among fossil fuel supporters is that the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. Climate groups say this is being addressed with huge power storage batteries and a better electric grid. Fossil fuel companies often mention ""reliable and affordable energy"" in ads and speeches.

Climate scientists say renewable energy is, in fact, reliable and affordable. Affordable: That's often an oil industry reference to the high costs of transitioning to a new technology. Climate groups argue that the costs of renewables have been falling sharply, and failing to stop climate change will also carry tremendous costs. Secure: The industry points to the scramble for fossil fuels after Russia invaded Ukraine as proof of how much the world still depends on these energy sources. And they say renewable energy relies on materials and manufacturing from abroad, while the U.S. has lots of oil and gas here. Supporters of renewable energy argue that they're actually more ""secure"" than oil, which is constantly fluctuating in price. The oil industry also says that fossil fuels are a reliable and cheap way to help developing economies expand electricity access, given that 745 million around the world are without it, according to the International Energy Agency. Reached for comment about this story, an ExxonMobil spokesperson called NPR's analysis ""simplistic,"" arguing that more oil and gas production is necessary to maintain and raise global living standards. The company also referred NPR to a recent speech from its CEO, Darren Woods, where he said, in part: ""The societal benefits of oil and gas are unmatched in human history. ... No country has ever joined the developed world without access to oil and gas."" Similarly, in an online panel before the climate talks, the president of COP28, Sultan al-Jaber — who is also the CEO of the UAE's state-run oil company — said: ""Show me a roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuels that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves.""

In fact, such roadmaps exist, and many experts say renewable energy can be used to fuel development. Eight years ago, the world set a shared target of holding global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, and ideally below 1.5 degrees Celsius. That's called the Paris Agreement. But the world did not agree on how to get there. Working out the how is what these climate talks are all about. And as they join the conversations, many oil producers will say they support the Paris Agreement, and talk about ""Paris-aligned scenarios."" Chevron, for instance, responded to NPR's request for comment on this story, in part, by saying: ""There are many potential pathways to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, the vast majority of which include the continued use of oil and gas for the foreseeable future."" But how much oil? Scientists have found that every pathway for meeting Paris targets includes reducing the use of oil and gas. This is what's at stake at the U.N.'s climate talks. The world is trying to figure out how exactly to meet the Paris goals — which experts say is difficult, but doable, if the world cuts the use of fossil fuels. And the oil industry is at the talks to openly argue that the world will not and should not switch away from oil and gas.",12292,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1215499778/cop28-uae-climate-talks-oil-exxon-mobil-chevron-climate-change-net-zero-unabated,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,abate phase implication ukraine blow opec crucial mario cleaner change march battery production fail happen dismay chevron carbon burn switch release theoretically panel refer big fight argue set atmosphere rig fossil lot high capture exist proven refers note unabated unit majority england ceo zero extraction announce statement pull ideally method language political paris human associate today secure combine history getty role target rapidan remark california npr venture agency doable conversation instance give record notice push require instead september involves away small compensate dependent world benefit continued word material fully strongly pledge point abroad exxonmobil affordable sponsorship make eliminate energy share cave electricity maintain warm living technology commonly similar price goal underground meeting fact plant million believe success key celsius trap ambition break initiative year inside amount sun mike indefinitely massive rid program focus tremendous barbara weekend heating bucket alternative reduce darren tout conference fuel huge coal cut continue place sound platform simplistic wind agree phrase uae producer product invade renewables meet figure activist constantly vast division caption story depends cancel cheap november dioxide reach typically openly tree call prominent head short client spotlight speak work santa net pollution president university joint refuse online reason increase giant gasoline reference bulk paasha found processing methane group degree nation unmatched felt scramble arab poor science global raise hide remove mention sell ago emphasizes sustainable jet development news developed analysis cost quantity greenhouse project societal accord promos country ground budget sponsor electric major concern renewable drilling heat common similarly source storage comment climate wood address potent commit professor turbine past stop transition conflict wonky solar company talk describes houston matter scenario expand spokesperson standard decides future equinor track proof invest real economy planet straightforward leader roadmap enormously show machine enter cleaning shine foreseeable policy reveal supporter expert ryan produce agreement industry gas respond united sharply pathway fraction bp avoid grid emirate international pavilion relies operation important image consider difficult mark scientist frequently join interest inject effect develop russia cartel building back heart mahdavi slippery low store mcnally carry hold fall support justin recent decide profit accounting potential include access objective earth acknowledge oil wirth emission fluctuate sky burning unwelcome ian list manufacturing bob part reliable power accomplish confuse straight roadmaps separation emit funding achieve stake request consultancy argues shorthand speech strict play sultan,0.9733,0.0732183534005857,8.363216080402012,0.4657008938303903,0,2023-12-05

James Bhagwan, the general secretary of the Pacific Conference of Churches, spoke on a panel on Monday in Dubai about how to comfort people in the Pacific islands who have been displaced from their ancestral and spiritual homelands because of rising sea levels and climate disasters.AdvertisementMr. Bhagwan cited Psalm 137, “How do I sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?”, and emphasized the importance of faith-based support for displaced people who face challenges in adjusting to their new homes. Parts of some low-lying island nations in the Pacific, like Tuvalu, are already being swallowed by rising seas.All religions are based in a recognition that nature is an act of divinity, according to the U.N. Environment Program. In the Baha’i faith, nature reflects both the divine and the oneness of humanity. In Buddhism, karma involves taking responsibility for future generations.

Politico,Biden’s billions for EV charging have yet to bring a charger online,2023-12-05 05:00:00,James Bikales,"Congress at the urging of the Biden administration agreed in 2021 to spend $7.5 billion to build tens of thousands of electric vehicle chargers across the country, aiming to appease anxious drivers while tackling climate change.Two years later, the program has yet to install a single charger.States and the charger industry blame the delays mostly on the labyrinth of new contracting and performance requirements they have to navigate to receive federal funds. While federal officials have authorized more than $2 billion of the funds to be sent to states, fewer than half of states have even started to take bids from contractors to build the chargers — let alone begin construction.Consumer demand for electric vehicles is rising in the United States, necessitating six times as many chargers on its roads by the end of the decade, according to federal estimates. But not a single charger funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law has come online and odds are they will not be able to start powering Americans’ vehicles until at least 2024.Getting chargers up and running across the country is essential to reaching President Joe Biden’s goal of having half the vehicles sold in the United States be electric by the end of the decade — a key cog of his climate agenda. Americans consistently say the lack of charging infrastructure is one of the top reasons they won’t buy an electric car.Republican opponents are now trying to shut down the administration’s efforts to build a charging network by choking off its funding. And the sluggish rollout could undermine Biden’s EV-themed reelection messaging and increase the possibility a Republican in the White House could roll back the charging network efforts in 2025.“It has been frustrating to say the least,” Arcady Sosinov, founder and CEO of charging manufacturer FreeWire Technologies, said of the slow pace of the rollout.Biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure package into law in 2021 with $7.5 billion specifically directed toward EV chargers, with an eye toward achieving his goal of building 500,000 chargers in the United States by 2030.The United States has around 180,000 chargers today, according to the Energy Department. That includes 41,000 of the type of fast chargers that can alleviate the dreaded “range anxiety” of a long-distance road trip in an electric vehicle.In a June study, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory projected the U.S. will need 1.2 million public chargers by 2030 to meet charging demand, including 182,000 fast chargers.Administration officials insist the pace at which they are rolling out the infrastructure law’s charging funds is to be expected, given the difficulty of creating a brand-new program in every state and marshaling the private sector to meet complex reliability and performance requirements for each federally-funded station.The goal is a reliable and standardized network in every corner of the nation, said Gabe Klein, executive director of the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, which leads the federal government’s efforts on EV charging.“You have to go slow to go fast,” Klein said in an interview. “These are things that take a little bit of time, but boy, when you’re done, it’s going to completely change the game.”The bulk of the infrastructure law funds, $5 billion, are dedicated to building fast chargers along interstate highways under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. The program requires the chargers meet a strict set of standards, such as being built at least every 50 miles over major routes, being operational at least 97 percent of the time and featuring credit card readers for easy payment.But Aatish Patel, president of charger manufacturer XCharge North America, is worried the delays in installing chargers are imperiling efforts to drive up EV adoption.“As an EV driver, a charger being installed in two years isn’t really going to help me out now,” Patel said. “We’re in dire need of chargers here.”The pace of the rollout will likely mean that few federally-funded chargers will be in the ground by next year’s election. And Republican opponents of the vehicles have seized on the lack of charging infrastructure to attack Biden’s efforts to boost electric vehicles.Former President Donald Trump has railed against subsidies for EVs and the infrastructure that powers them, arguing the market should dictate what type of car Americans drive. But he has also relentlessly attacked EVs for their range and the dearth of chargers — the issue Biden is aiming to solve with the infrastructure law funds.“They say the happiest day when you buy an electric car is the first 10 minutes you’re driving it, and then after that, panic sets in because you’re worried, ‘Where the hell am I going to get a charge to keep this thing going?’” Trump said at a September rally with autoworkers in Michigan.In the House in November, GOP lawmakers offered amendments to the transportation spending bill to strip funding from the charging programs created by the infrastructure law.“Not only is such an endeavor not the federal government’s responsibility, this program doesn’t work, won’t work and will end up wasting massive amounts of federal money,” Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) argued on the House floor.Her amendment to defund the NEVI program was soundly defeated, with 238 lawmakers from both parties voting against it. But the House adopted a separate amendment from Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) that would hollow out its sister program, the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program, which provides $2.5 billion for chargers in rural areas and at community gathering points.Administration officials say they aren’t concerned a future administration could try to roll back the program, pointing to enthusiasm for the funds from red state governors and the private sector alike.Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, whose state broke ground on the nation’s first charger funded by the NEVI program in October, said in a statement that he is committed to “truly positioning Ohioans for the electric future.”“This groundbreaking further demonstrates the state’s commitment to installing chargers as quickly as possible for the benefit of Ohio drivers,” DeWine said.Under the infrastructure law, the NEVI funds are administered by states, which can contract out the construction and operation of the charging stations to private companies. So far, every state has taken the initial steps to receive the NEVI cash by submitting a plan to the Joint Office in 2022 and an update in 2023. But if a governor were to reject the funds, municipalities could apply to administer the funds instead.“I’m probably more excited now … than I’ve been anytime since I took this job because everybody’s paddling in the right direction — purple state, blue state, red state,” Klein said. “Everybody’s seeing the impact of the investments.”Following Ohio, Pennsylvania also broke ground on its first NEVI-funded charger in November. Another six states have awarded contracts for their first round of charging sites, while 15 states plus Puerto Rico are in the process of soliciting bids from the private sector.But 27 states and D.C. have yet to even start soliciting bids, with some states like Missouri anticipating they may not post their solicitation until 2025. (Three of those states — Nevada, New York and Vermont — are procuring some federally-funded chargers outside of a public request for bids, but plan to solicit bids in the future.)Even some states with high rates of EV adoption, like California and Washington, have yet to award any of their funds.Sosinov noted, though, that design, engineering, installation and utility upgrades could extend the wait by years even after the contracts to build stations are awarded.The other charging program created by the law, the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program, has yet to allocate any funds, with the first awards expected by the end of the year.The Biden administration is expecting a deluge of chargers funded by the law to break ground in early 2024. A senior administration official granted anonymity to speak on the specifics of the rollout said the pace is to be expected, given that the goal is to create a “convenient, affordable, reliable, made-in-America equitable network.”“Anybody can throw a charger in the ground — that’s not that hard, it doesn’t take that long,” the official said. “Building a network is different.”The administration insists it is doing all it can to speed up the process, including by streamlining federal permitting for EV chargers and providing technical assistance to states and companies through the Joint Office. It expects the U.S. to hit Biden’s 500,000 charger target four years early, in 2026, the official said.It’s not clear, however, how many of those will be fast chargers. The NEVI program prioritizes building those types of chargers, especially in remote locations along interstate highways where it might not otherwise be profitable for a private company to build a charger.The slow rollout of the NEVI program primarily boils down to the difficulties state agencies and charging companies face in meeting a complex set of contracting requirements and minimum operating standards for the federally-funded chargers, according to interviews with state and EV industry officials.Jim McDonnell, director of engineering at the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which is assisting states in administering the federal charger funding, said the work of distributing the NEVI funds largely fell to state offices that had never worked on EV charging before.“Considering it’s a brand new program and the minimal amount of background that a lot of the state DOTs had in EV infrastructure, procurement and deployment when we went into this, I’m thrilled how fast they’ve gotten things off the ground,” McDonnell said.That’s shown in the states that have been early leaders in the program. Ohio was able to become the first state to break ground on a NEVI charger largely because it had completed years of planning and siting work for an EV network before the infrastructure law passed, said Preeti Choudhary, the executive director of DriveOhio, the state office administering the funds.Charger manufacturers, meanwhile, have had to step up research and development to ensure their federally-funded chargers work 97 percent of the time, the new minimum standard intended to alleviate persistent reliability issues with America’s chargers. And they’ve had to invest in U.S. manufacturing facilities to meet new domestic sourcing requirements for the equipment.All of that has slowed the process for states to open bidding to build chargers and for companies to place bids, said Patrick Murphy, who is leading the Vermont Agency of Transportation’s administration of the funds.“This program has suffered from a number of frustrating delays and will still yet as industry tries to catch up to the rules that were put in place,” Murphy said. “But we also recognize that those rules will help shape the kind of consistent convenient national network that we need to grow EV adoption.”Tanya Snyder contributed to this report.",11214,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/congress-ev-chargers-billions-00129996,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/658a709/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4284x2856+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F07%2F7e%2F5c574a1f4c3fbf71ffd8da4706f9%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1242853588,Climate and Environment,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,today minute authorize dearth planning country type reelection company solicitation law complex rule streamline probably facility energy commitment upgrade fuel bulk administration argue pace prioritizes founder appease break construction range receive technology thousand groundbreaking official domestic hard especially sluggish throw procurement set agenda sister effort executive online snyder june area reach eye bill require agree award boost boy assist fell leader patrick sector high september red autoworkers anticipate work bipartisan insists ground key state slow seize follow anonymity equitable direct show kind billion round submit complete meeting amendment distribute joe reliability power put half bidding mike october governor hit sell thrill clear engineering biden bit patel initial freewire senior give create ceo demonstrates future deluge interview grow requirement roll nation administer convenient opponent market defund post allocate install choudhary defeat demand top extend california mcdonnell change issue ten money permit profitable association navigate single relentlessly insist donald largely gop open vermont dedicate dot request manufacturing possible adopt ensure imperil funding place separate consistent house happiest year nevada cog director trump card rate industry blame grant concerned estimate standardize worried harriet direction utility enthusiasm government alleviate lead completely vehicle note background boil project aim transportation operation rollout puerto rico paddle undermine pass electric recognize route contribute blue report private strip deployment goal strict marshal expect amount subsidy anxiety solve preeti drive build ev decade performance commit american sign number feature back agency infrastructure washington offer message nevus united rural massive gathering consistently million point specific anytime specifically lack run speak quickly republican election purple long shut lawmaker klein hageman xcharge major rail trip national manufacturer party cash operating wait minimal fast credit package burlison necessitate murphy contract broke primarily building target early bid network choke position process frustrate white essential dewine sosinov spending dictate soundly anxious statement reject hell remote road charger ohio buy joint start community persistent gov tackle labyrinth fund reason reader renewable reliable source plan driver climate office instal endeavor study station time benefit eric technical assistance public increase pennsylvania invest consider impact easy voting meet department north odds charge car missouri president step site adoption affordable possibility laboratory standard municipality america procure interstate arcady built excite mile dread rise minimum dire ohioan urge achieve federal research provide york accord installation percent location catch waste rally day begin operational corner apply congress attack driveohio spend panic design highway include program brand shape hollow solicit development job update suffer lot contractor difficulty responsibility speed aatish delay november intend,0.577,0.1070090957731407,11.092533202164288,0.4072318738766107,0,2023-12-05
CNN,"Fossil fuel industry nearly quadrupled registrations at climate summit since last year, watchdog report says",2023-12-05 01:45:00,Laura Paddison,"More than 2,400 people connected to the fossil fuel industry registered to attend the COP28 climate summit in Dubai — a massive representation that’s nearly four times the number that signed up for last year’s climate gathering, according to an analysis published Tuesday.Fossil fuel employees and representatives outnumber every country’s delegation except for the United Arab Emirates, the host of COP28, and Brazil, according to the report from a coalition of corporate watchdog and climate advocacy groups, including Global Witness.Overall attendance at the summit has also skyrocketed in recent years, with more than 80,000 people registered for the Dubai meeting — more than twice the number who registered for last year’s summit in Egypt. The report was not able to count how many fossil fuel representatives are actually in attendance, though it has shown registration numbers have been increasing over the years.The findings are likely to fuel tensions at the already controversial climate summit, where the future role of fossil fuels, the main driver of the climate crisis, is shaping up to be one of the key sticking points.COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, also an oil executive, has argued the fossil fuel industry should be involved in the summit.“Let history reflect the fact that this is the presidency that made a bold choice to proactively engage with oil and gas companies,” he said during his opening remarks Thursday. CNN has reached out to the COP28 team for comment.The analysis from the coalition, which this year organized under the name Kick Big Polluters Out, looked at the provisional list of COP participants to identify registrants with self-declared ties to fossil fuel companies or organizations with fossil fuel interests or foundations owned or controlled by a fossil fuel company.It found an “unprecedented” 2,456 fossil fuel employees and representatives registered to attend COP28, significantly more than the 636 who signed up for COP27 in Egypt in 2022.This year’s analysis was made easier by the United Nations’ decision in June that for the first time it would require fossil fuel lobbyists to disclose their affiliations when registering for the summit.Fossil fuel employees and representatives received more passes to COP28 than all the delegates from the 10 most climate-vulnerable countries combined, according to the research.“The hallways and negotiating rooms of this climate conference are flooded with the largest number of fossil fuel lobbyists ever,” said Lili Fuhr, director of the fossil fuel energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law.Governments must “remain focused on delivering an outcome that supports and mandates a full phase out of fossil fuels while protecting public policy-making from fossil fuel interests,” she told CNN. “It remains our only chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 (degrees Celsius).”Some scientists and advocacy groups have expressed increasing concerns about the ambition levels of the summit after recently resurfaced comments made by Al Jaber in the run up to COP28. In a recorded panel session last month, he told participants there was “no science” that said phasing out fossil fuels was necessary to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.After the remarks came to light on Sunday, Al Jaber fiercely defended his commitment to climate goals and science. At a news conference Monday, he told reporters his remarks had been misinterpreted and that a phase-down and phase-out of fossil fuels was “inevitable” and “essential.”The number of fossil employees and representatives at COP summits has been increasing over the years, according to the annual report. Attendees connected to fossil fuel companies have attended COP summits at least 7,200 times over the last two decades, according to a KBPO report in November.",3839,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/climate/cop28-fossil-fuel-industry-registrations-climate/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/local/231129103056-2023-cop-and-beyond-logo-large-169.png?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill/h_80",Climate and Environment,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dubai phase increase warm controversial coalition found decade time significantly commitment president goal group degree light monday industry gas session nation representation negotiate united register jaber inevitable skyrocket meeting employee publish fact brazil remains arab emirate representative choice science global pass international kbpo key celsius panel ambition room big public argue outnumber driver told year cnn organization scientist advocacy engage interest run corporate massive program fossil lobbyist attendee focus news analysis egypt reflect watchdog registration shape registrant summit accord fiercely country flood annual report support stick team month opening fuel conference unprecedented recent crisis tension provisional concern identify recently disclose center easy bold delegation outcome defend include combine comment full executive finding presidency resurface reporter history climate remain oil deliver role count proactively remark thursday connect receive lili gathering cop list foundation protect control record tie meet require number organize limit company misinterpret mandate kick level delegate environmental participant express sunday reach november future hallway june sign large chance fuhr director involve make show polluter decision host attendance affiliation attend energy sultan,0.92155,0.3125814014066163,12.545684210526314,0.4337606837606837,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,"Oil, gas and coal interests swarm global climate summit in Dubai",2023-12-05 00:00:00,Timothy Puko,"Fossil fuel interests are swarming this year’s U.N. Climate Change Conference, possibly like never before, according to research released Tuesday by a coalition of advocacy groups.More than 2,400 people with ties to companies that produce or consume oil, natural gas, and coal — or from trade groups that advocate for those industries — are registered to attend COP28 in Dubai, according to the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition, which reviewed public registrations. That outnumbered nearly all the national and civil society delegations on hand to negotiate at the world’s biggest climate summit, according to the group.The fossil fuel representation is rising even faster than overall attendance, which has also surged this year as global temperatures hit records and more companies, financiers, world leaders and activists see rising stakes at the event. Compared with last year’s summit in Egypt, four times the number of people with fossil fuel ties are registered to attend, while overall attendance is up roughly threefold, the coalition said.The numbers reflect how the global oil and gas industry is investing to influence the world’s response to climate change. The oil-rich United Arab Emirates is COP28’s host and appointed Sultan Al Jaber, who runs its state-owned oil company and a renewable energy company, as president. Al Jaber’s team has made a full-throated defense of fossil fuels’ potential to help address climate change, and welcomed oil companies into negotiations on deals to cut planet-warming emissions.“For 30 years, industry has denied, deceived, and delayed climate action at the [United Nations] and every level of government,” the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said in an email. “And yet this body has treated these deceptive, self-serving, disingenuous, bad actors to a seat at a table they have no business being at.”Spokespeople for COP28 leadership could not immediately be reached for a response.Al Jaber spearheaded a deal announced Saturday for oil and gas companies to reduce some of their emissions, and he and other industry advocates have said carbon-capture systems and other technologies can reduce fossil fuels’ contribution to climate change. Alan Armstrong, chief executive of the pipeline giant Williams Cos., said the United States has become a world leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions — in large part by transitioning from coal to natural gas.Executives are “tired of being told they’re bad people because they’re part of the fossil fuel industry, while they have a lot to offer on emissions reductions,” said Armstrong, reflecting the industry’s messaging that natural gas is less damaging to the climate than coal.“We are really kind of focused on making sure there’s an awareness around the opportunity of reducing emissions with natural gas,” added Armstrong, whose company transports a third of the U.S. gas supply and has never before sent a representative to COP.Scientists convened by the United Nations have concluded burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of climate change. A detailed United Nations assessment released in September said the world remains far off track in its efforts to halt it, and that aggressively scaling up renewable energy and phasing out fossil fuels are among the best ways to avoid global warming’s worst consequences.The Kick Big Polluters Out coalition has more than 450 endorsements, including activist groups such as Greenpeace and Code Pink, to block companies from helping write rules on climate policy or bankrolling efforts to do so. As part of its activism, it regularly reviews the official lists of COP delegates, which includes attendees from governments, U.N. bodies, intergovernmental organizations and the media.The authors classified delegates as fossil fuel industry representatives if they listed an affiliation or membership with a fossil fuel company or trade association, or sometimes companies just with ties to them. While its list includes many executives from companies such as oil giant ExxonMobil and coal miner Glencore, it also includes some from consumer products companies such as PepsiCo and Nestlé, or energy companies that have made big investments in renewables such as Siemens Energy and Orsted.The coalition said trade groups are the largest forces of fossil fuel lobbyists at COP28, in some cases far outnumbering individual companies. It says the largest is the Geneva-based International Emissions Trading Association — a business group devoted to credit trading as a way to reduce emissions — which brought 116 people from companies including oil majors Shell and TotalEnergies.A spokeswoman for the association pointed to the group’s official policy on participation in the climate talks.A Shell spokesman said the company sends “a small number” to these events as observers, and broadly the company advocates for policies that support lower-carbon energy.TotalEnergies could not immediately be reached.While COP attendance from fossil fuel companies is clearly surging, it is difficult to fully confirm whether this year’s number is a record. The United Nations has not historically required delegates to disclose their affiliation with a fossil fuel company or trade group, so historic disclosures have been voluntary and probably led to undercounting, the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition has said.",5347,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/05/un-climate-conference-dubai-oil-lobbyists/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,summit deceptive regularly disclose interest company assessment large code team organization deal rule bankrolling sends cut confirm gas activism probably make energy actor advocate detailed voluntary fuel greenpeace emirate representation register tie global number contribution individual technology egypt conclude membership spokesman offer message cop negotiation official tuesday consume remains classify united treat point negotiate run difficult support attendee pipeline siemens conference miner effort response executive nestlé system reach fully emission damage major trade national require halt force armstrong giant intergovernmental credit group leader track hand threefold september coalition part convene release devote burning endorsement disingenuous policy deny attendance possibly temperature state broadly pink world defense potential spearhead told surge kind observer write avoid swarm aggressively host exxonmobil faster registration alan supply list greenhouse attend financier transition jaber tire renewable hit produce civil announce focus historic investment climate driver time historically action public influence warm invest delayed business international stake reflect polluter email nation compare appoint transport activist kick representative pepsico address president change dubai record consumer arab lobbyist association affiliation roughly deceive small add opportunity big trading rise event immediately reduce sultan coal brought research awareness accord delegation leadership chief seat case fossil spokespeople undercounting year glencore participation reduction phase industry level welcome body williams include advocacy product government table society lead author scale block natural delegate spokeswoman oil shell disclosure lot outnumber primary saturday renewables review,0.9379,0.1122124555825696,12.585367965367965,0.4129205368044654,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Renewables and EVs are soaring. It’s still not enough.,2023-12-04 19:01:00,Shannon Osaka,"The last year has been filled with energy news that seems hopeful. The world has now installed more than 1 terawatt of solar panel capacity — enough to power the entire European Union. Purchases of electric vehicles have been surging: Over 1 million vehicles have been sold in the United States this year, with an estimated 14 million sold worldwide. And, looking at the rapid growth in wind, batteries and technologies such as heat pumps, you could be excused for thinking that the fight against climate change might actually be going … well.But a new analysis, released Tuesday morning local time as world leaders gather in Dubai to discuss the progress in cutting emissions, shows the grim truth: The surge in renewables has not been enough to displace fossil fuels. Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels are expected to rise by 1.1 percent in 2023, according to the analysis from the Global Carbon Project.“Renewables are growing to record levels, but fossil fuels also keep growing to record highs,” said Glen Peters, a senior researcher at the Cicero Center for International Climate Research in Oslo who co-wrote the new analysis.The growth in emissions comes largely from India and China — which continue to burn large amounts of coal as their citizens use more electricity — and from increases in flying and international shipping. Emissions from aviation, which have been returning to normal levels since the coronavirus pandemic, are projected to grow by a gigantic 28 percent in 2023.And while emissions are declining slightly in developed countries, such as the United States and the European Union, they aren’t falling quickly enough. Emissions in the United States are projected to decrease by 3 percent this year — American emissions from coal will drop to levels not seen since the early 1900s — while E.U. emissions will fall by about 7 percent.A single-digit growth in emissions may not sound like much, but global temperatures won’t start to level off until net carbon emissions reach zero. Even if emissions started to plummet rapidly in the next year or so, it would take years to reach zero — and during that time, temperatures would continue to rise.The contrast between the growth in renewables and the continued increase in fossil fuel emissions reflects one of the greatest debates around climate change: whether the growth of clean energy will, on its own, be sufficient to curb planet-warming emissions.So far, countries around the world are fighting climate change by subsidizing renewable energy rather than putting firm limits on the use of fossil fuels. The Biden administration’s landmark climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, funnels about $370 billion toward building wind and solar infrastructure, as well as batteries and electric vehicles — but the United States is still the world’s largest producer (and consumer) of fossil fuels. The European Union does have a system that limits the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation, but it doesn’t yet include cars on the road or other sources of carbon pollution.Part of that stems from politics: Attempts to tax or limit CO2 emissions have often sparked significant backlash. But many experts say that just boosting clean energy won’t be enough to really cut fossil fuels. “We’re just not putting in policies that push fossil fuels out,” said Peters, the researcher in Oslo. “Fossil fuels just happily keep growing.”Even at the largest international climate meetings, discussing the end of fossil fuels has triggered contentious fights. Delegates at the U.N. climate conference, known as COP28, are battling over whether agreement language should call for a “phase out” or a “phase down” of fossil fuels.The new data also means that the world is becoming more and more unlikely to hit its goal of keeping the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) to avert devastating climate impacts. Although world leaders continue to discuss the goal at global warming talks — U.N. Secretary General António Guterres described the world as “minutes to midnight for the 1.5-degree limit” last week — most climate scientists now believe that global temperatures will pass that threshold sooner rather than later.",4242,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/04/carbon-emissions-increase-renewables-evs/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,continued believe net union fly stem truth minute developed aviation antónio country firm goal week guterres discus large sound battery terawatt cut energy entire expect subsidize slightly fuel decline amount talk continue administration pump secretary american global avert backlash morning technology data infrastructure tuesday happily midnight language united glen decrease million general celsius quickly push threshold conference normal excuse return system described reach emission contentious sooner wind bill debate funnel hopeful significant boost leader carbon high contrast release building policy shipping india early degree temperature state cicero world act news surge show panel billion rapidly curb road meeting start capacity dioxide gigantic electricity power put scientist renewable hit source sell call biden plummet devastate climate instal senior time drop battling increase warm spark impact heat gather international tax coronavirus landmark reflect grow grim trigger center worldwide car solar agreement change dubai record consumer local generation clean progress largely growth planet purchase rise rapid zero research coal accord oslo sufficient china percent discuss fossil limit year expert fahrenheit inflation citizen reduction politics phase level pandemic researcher analysis estimate include burn fight producer vehicle attempt fill european project great delegate displace electric fall renewables,0.9767,0.0707213578500707,10.858983050847456,0.3986984356031974,0,2023-12-04
NPR,"U.N. climate talks head says ""no science"" backs ending fossil fuels. That's incorrect",2023-12-04 09:17:00,Rebecca Hersher,"Sultan al-Jaber, who is also the chief executive of the United Arab Emirates' state-run oil company, made the comments in an online meeting on November 21. That was little over a week before he officially began to preside over annual U.N. climate negotiations, known as COP28, that are being held this year in the UAE. The comments were first reported by The Guardian, which also published a video of the meeting. Al-Jaber sought to clarify those comments in a press conference on Monday from the climate summit he's presiding over. But his position as both chairman of a major Mideast renewables company and as CEO of Abu Dhabi's state-owned oil company has already drawn criticism and extra scrutiny of al-Jaber's role as this year's conference president, where he sets the tone and must unite countries around a common message and pledges. In the video, Ireland's former president Mary Robinson asks al-Jaber to use his position to push for a global agreement to phase out fossil fuels. Such language was not included in the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, and has been repeatedly blocked by petroleum-dependent countries at subsequent negotiations. That's despite unequivocal, and long-standing, scientific consensus that humanity must transition to renewable energy sources immediately in order to avoid catastrophic warming, including runaway sea level rise, mass extinction of plants and animals and countless lives lost to extreme weather. In the video, however, al-Jaber responds to Robinson's suggestion with this incorrect statement: ""I respect the science, and there is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what's going to achieve 1.5 [degrees Celsius]."" In reality, scientists warn that the only paths to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius require phasing out fossil fuels including oil, gas and coal. Under the Paris agreement, world leaders agreed to limit global warming to well-below 2 degrees of warming, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, compared to temperatures in the late 1800s. That's because, beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, numerous climate tipping points loom and millions of people are threatened by rising seas and extreme weather, scientists warn. The planet has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius over the last 150 years, largely due to human activity. The U.N.'s own scientific reports – which are supposed to guide global negotiations – repeatedly underscore the importance of phasing out fossil fuels. In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, carbon dioxide emissions would need to decrease 80% by 2040 and 99% by 2050, compared to levels in 2019, according to the most comprehensive global scientific consensus report on climate change. That report was published earlier this year by more than 200 scientists from around the world working for the U.N. And less than two weeks before this year's talks kicked off, the U.N. released an annual report that underscored the importance of reining in fossil fuel operations. It warned that, if humans extract and burn all the oil, gas and coal currently in development worldwide, countries would collectively emit more than three times the amount of carbon dioxide as is compatible with hitting the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature limit. That means all new fossil development is incompatible with avoiding catastrophic warming, because, right now, there is not scalable technology that allows humans to burn fossil fuels without emitting enormous amounts of planet-warming gasses. In remarks at the climate talks underway in Dubai on Monday, al-Jaber said that his comments in the video had been taken out of context, and insisted that he understands and supports climate science. ""We're here because we very much believe and respect the science,"" he told reporters, explaining that global greenhouse gas emissions must be slashed this decade. ""We need to make that happen to keep 1.5 within reach."" He did not answer a question about exactly how quickly humans must stop relying on fossil fuels in order to achieve that goal.

It declared that wealthy countries “shall” set targets for cutting their planet-heating emissions.That line may not seem problematic, but in global talks to save the planet, every word has the potential to sink an agreement to slow Earth’s catastrophic warming.“‘Shall’ is a legal obligation. ‘Should’ is not,” said Reifsnyder, now an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia’s Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. “There’s an absolute world of difference between those two verbs. And frankly, ‘shall’ would have made it impossible for the United States to sign on to the Paris agreement as a legal matter.”Ultimately, the linguistic kerfuffle in Paris was resolved. “Shall” was replaced with “should,” and the 2015 summit was considered a success. But at this year’s U.N. Climate Change Conference, known as COP28, a dispute over fossil fuels threatens to derail progress at the crucial gathering in Dubai.At issue is whether negotiators from nearly 200 nations should agree to phase “down” or phase “out” the burning of fossil fuels, the primary driver of rising global temperatures. The former implies a gradual decline, while the latter implies the eventual elimination of oil, gas and coal as the world transitions to cleaner forms of energy.“I know there are strong views about including language on fossil fuels,” COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, who also heads the United Arab Emirates’ state-run oil company, said at the opening of the conference. “I ask you all to work together. Be flexible. Find common ground.”But veteran climate diplomats say common ground may be tough to find.“The phasedown versus phaseout is a bit of a conundrum,” said Nate Hultman, a former senior State Department official who now directs the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland.“Words matter at COPs because they convey real commitment,” he added. “And if we’re trying with nearly 200 countries to get rapid action, that is frankly challenging.”Observers of the talks have long expected fossil fuel-dependent Saudi Arabia and Russia to try to block the “phaseout” language. But China’s climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, surprised some observers by declaring in September that it is “not realistic” to eliminate fossil fuels.“With China, traditionally they always want language that signals their commitment but doesn’t make them beholden to anybody else,” said Rachel Kyte, a visiting professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.Kyte, a longtime attendee of the global climate talks, compared the search for the right language to a dance with multiple partners.“Everybody is able to dance, and you find the language that nobody really likes, but everybody is sufficiently comfortable,” she said. “And it’s a dance around accountability. What are you on the hook for?”Representing the United States at this year’s talks are John F. Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, and Sue Biniaz, his deputy. Biniaz has a reputation as a wordsmith; she carries crossword puzzles in her purse and once wrote an academic paper on commas and other punctation in climate treaties. Kerry, for his part, told reporters on the eve of COP28 that he supported “language requiring the phaseout of unabated fossil fuels.”In climate circles, the word “unabated” has sparked another big squabble.The word refers to carbon emissions that are not captured and stored deep underground. At the climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021, negotiators agreed to accelerate “efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power.”However, many environmentalists view carbon-capture technology as a false climate solution, saying it can prolong the life of fossil fuel infrastructure for decades to come. They note that the International Energy Agency has said humanity cannot build any new oil, gas or coal infrastructure if it hopes to meet the goal of the Paris agreement: preventing dangerous global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.“Scientific demands for a phaseout of fossil fuels have been watered down into more mealy-mouthed language” about abatement, said Collin Rees, U.S. program manager at the climate advocacy group Oil Change International.A senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, defended the word “unabated,” saying that carbon-capture technology could play an important role in reducing emissions from energy-hungry processes such as steel and cement production.“It may be that it doesn’t pan out as a technology,” the official said. “But I don’t think we’re at the stage that we would rule it out through these negotiations.”A second State Department official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment, said the difference between a fossil fuel “phaseout” and a fossil fuel “phasedown” is less important than the time frame for the transition.“You could say ‘phaseout by 2100,’ and that would be a lot weaker than ‘phasedown by 2050,’” this person said, adding: “People are acting as if those are the only two words in the English language that could possibly address the issue of fossil fuels. But the English language is rich enough that I’m sure if there is controversy about one or the other of those words, we could find a third one.”The debate over whether to phase “out” or phase “down” fossil fuels is not merely an academic exercise conducted by diplomats in Dubai. It has life-or-death consequences for millions of people around the globe who are exposed to harmful air pollution from the burning of oil, gas and coal.According to a study published last week in the British Medical Journal, air pollution from fossil fuel combustion is responsible for an estimated 5.13 million excess deaths per year — much higher than previous estimates. Most of these premature deaths stemmed from cardiometabolic conditions such as heart disease.“A phaseout of fossil fuels would have tremendous positive health outcomes,” said Jos Lelieveld, an author of the study and director of the atmospheric chemistry department at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. “That is something we tried to communicate to people who are now negotiating at COP28.”Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the former environment minister of Peru who served as president of the 2014 climate talks in Lima, said language about a fossil fuel phaseout could also reverberate across global markets, potentially slowing investments in polluting projects.“It’s so important to have clear language that can send a clear signal to the economic sector,” said Pulgar-Vidal, who is now the global leader of climate and energy with WWF.Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, sought to remind delegates of the real-world consequences of their words at the summit’s outset.",7167,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/04/cop28-climate-talks-language/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,versus observer reduce controversy scotland water center john remind action declare big environmentalist visit target emission dance opening lelieveld send global change cleaner act goal public comment warm director note carry author xie english potential reputation common false consider consequence biniaz secretary flexible make latter veteran leader official gradual single deep meet air outset obligation rule china draft eve paris rapid agreement expect save bury high positive impossible rees technology sought cement arab stage sink head rise country zhenhua senior cut success manuel outcome rachel wealthy kerry role difference company clear threatens combustion economic primary infrastructure pan weaker scientific replace publicly atmospheric burning week convey potentially leadership long sultan cop set life dispute sustainability minister collin summit earth diplomat school million crossword spoke person government discover attendee prolong bit medical president agree heart hook resolve transition capture store time sufficiently real convention world directs talk work lot celsius condition defend cardiometabolic agency part batten underground academic possibly exercise tremendous fossil ultimately absolute puzzle gathering crucial reifsnyder planet responsible spark death arabia frankly abatement jaber purse word kerfuffle realistic issue conference executive conundrum nation chemistry comma state department anonymity group health line coal fuel virginia signal institute peru reporter glasgow behalf progress view kyte prevent investment demand accelerate envoy write british language degree negotiator unabated strong phaseout premature dubai solution text daniel year fahrenheit environment slow wordsmith publish problematic manager represent study multiple tough form advocacy stiell search energy add international block compare stem sector build reverberate russia require phase longtime conduct surprised negotiate beholden adjunct planck refers framework support address emirate commitment carbon policy matter expose pollution pollute implies linguistic september blavatnik elimination accountability play decade estimate verb remembers rich frame derail hope phasedown comfortable excess globe gas find deputy sign climate circle market treaty communicate dangerous previous delegate process united decline university eliminate effort steel include driver catastrophic max important journal told debate hultman traditionally punctation professor ground preindustrial temperature authorize legal serve humanity former eventual harmful saudi paper program oil,0.9903,0.2930096274591879,10.096130952380951,0.4003150057273769,0,2023-12-04
NPR,Companies say they're closing in on nuclear fusion as an energy source. Will it work?,2023-12-04 05:04:00,Geoff Brumfiel,"Standing in front of a set of aluminum coils that look like an advanced engine for some yet-to-be-built starship, Kirtley makes the case for his project that he's made to venture capital firms and wealthy private investors: Fusion power could change the world. If it worked, it would grant humanity eye-watering quantities of electricity without producing any greenhouse gas emissions. The warming of the planet would slow, environmental pollution would drop, and energy would be cheaper than ever. ""We can generate electricity, theoretically, at much lower costs than we currently generate it now,"" he says. ""And do it without fossil fuels."" The pitch has worked. In its last major fundraising round in November of 2021, Kirtley's company, called Helion, raised an impressive $500 million. That money came from investors like Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, who has shown an active interest in investing in nuclear fusion and fission as potential forms of clean energy for the future. Now Helion's more than 200 employees are working at breakneck pace to try and build the world's first commercial fusion power plant. They hope their newest machine, currently under construction, will produce electrical output by the end of 2024 and net energy in a matter of years. A section of aluminium coils from one of Helion's fusion machines. The company hopes its next-generation Polaris system will produce more electricity than it consumes. Geoff Brumfiel/NPR hide caption A section of aluminium coils from one of Helion's fusion machines. The company hopes its next-generation Polaris system will produce more electricity than it consumes. To call that goal ambitious is a spectacular understatement. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers stars like the sun. In the 1950s and 60s, governments poured money into research, hoping for clean, essentially limitless energy here on Earth. So far, bottling the power of stars for human consumption is looking much harder than scientists anticipated. Government laboratories have put in decades of work trying to get fusion power on the grid. But those efforts have been plagued by false starts, broken promises, and gargantuan cost overruns. A grim joke has taken hold in the field: Fusion is the energy of the future — and it always will be. Helion, and a handful of other companies, are hoping to shift that view by generating fusion on a scale of years, rather than decades. It should be possible, they say, in part because of the long-running public investment in fusion research, and because new technology and equipment can be brought to bear on the problem. For investors, the payoff could be enormous. Electricity demand is expected to surge globally in the coming decades, in part due to an increased reliance on greener technologies like electric vehicles and appliances. Meanwhile, the planet's only hope for stopping global warming is to do away with fossil fuels. Tomorrow, at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry is expected to lay out a strategy for trying to commercialize fusion power worldwide. Whichever company can make its fusion technology work would likely earn a valuation that would rival the biggest Silicon Valley firms today. Nuclear power plants today use a process called fission, which harvests the energy released by breaking heavy atoms apart. Nuclear fusion does the opposite: It generates energy by sticking lightweight atoms together. When the atoms stick, they create new elements and particles that weigh less than the total mass of the originals. That missing mass is converted to energy, via Einstein's famous equation E=mc2. It's that conversion from mass to energy that makes fusion among the most powerful processes in the universe. It's also tricky. The cores of atoms, known as nuclei, are positively charged. Like the north ends of two magnets, these positive charges repel one another as they get close — and the closer they get, the more the tiny atoms swerve and bounce trying to avoid each other. It's only in the hottest and densest environments in the universe that the atoms can overcome this powerful repulsion and actually stick. The most common place this happens is in stars, including our sun. The sun is a massive fusion reactor that supports all life on Earth. AP hide caption The sun is a massive fusion reactor that supports all life on Earth. ""Basically, the sun weighs so much that it's able to squeeze these atoms together and fuse them,"" says Carolyn Kuranz, an associate professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan. The sun works primarily by fusing hydrogen into helium, but other stars fuse heavier elements, including carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and lithium — and even iron. ""Actually, that's how the iron in our blood was generated,"" Kuranz says — by other stars that, upon their deaths, sent these heavier elements out into the universe. Back here on Earth, without the aid of a crushing gravitational field, fusion becomes a much trickier task. The fusing atoms must be heated to high temperatures and held close enough together that they can overcome their repulsion. In the process, they cannot interact with their container or touch anything around them — otherwise they'll cause it to melt. ""Imagine putting the sun inside some sort of gas tank,"" she says. In fact there's only been one device ever made that can produce net fusion energy — the thermonuclear bomb. It uses the energy of a ""smaller"" nuclear fission device to crush hydrogen into helium. The entire process happens in just a fraction of a second, and once the fusion reactions start, there's no hope of containment — the first hydrogen bomb ever tested vaporized the island it was detonated on. The goal of fusion scientists is to build a device that could harness all that power to safely generate a steady current of electricity. For decades they have been pursuing two approaches. One, known as magnetic confinement, requires suspending the hot plasma inside a magnetic shell. It's a tough approach, and it requires a large vessel that can hold the hot gas without touching it. Currently, nations from around the globe are trying to build just such a machine in the south of France. It might someday generate net power, but it is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. The other approach, known as inertial confinement, uses lasers to squeeze tiny pellets of hydrogen fuel until they start a runaway fusion reaction. The process is not unlike a nuclear weapon, and that's why the first successful test to produce net power took place at a nuclear weapons laboratory. Last December, researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's National Ignition Facility used an array of 192 lasers to squeeze a tiny frozen pellet of fusion fuel until it burst. The energy from the pellet was greater than the power put in by the lasers, marking a major milestone for fusion as an energy source. The National Ignition Facility used lasers to generate net energy from a pellet of fusion fuel in 2022. But the experiment is still a long way from truly producing more electricity than it requires. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hide caption The National Ignition Facility used lasers to generate net energy from a pellet of fusion fuel in 2022. But the experiment is still a long way from truly producing more electricity than it requires. Despite that success, researchers like Kuranz conceded the technique faces huge engineering challenges before it can be commercially viable. ""There's a lot of steps in between that it would take to get to electricity,"" she says. To create a steady flow of fusion power would require the lasers to zap a tiny target ""many times a minute or even many times a second,"" she says. And the lasers would have to be many times more efficient than the ones used at the facility — they gobbled up megajoules of electricity to produce the laser light needed to squeeze the pellet. For Helion's David Kirtley, the ponderous scientific approach that governments have taken to fusion is frustrating. ""Early in my career, I wanted to solve big problems in the Universe; big problems for humanity,"" he says. But as he progressed through a PhD in physics, he discovered that ""the approaches for fusion I was learning about in school weren't actually going to turn on and generate electrons on the grid in my lifetime."" Helion's CEO David Kirtley believes that fusion could change the world: ""We can generate electricity at theoretically much lower cost than we do it now,"" he says. Geoff Brumfiel/NPR hide caption Helion's CEO David Kirtley believes that fusion could change the world: ""We can generate electricity at theoretically much lower cost than we do it now,"" he says. Helion was founded in 2013 with a single goal — to put fusion power on the grid. As we walk through the company's manufacturing facility, Kirtley explains how it works. Helion's design is basically a long tube of magnetic coils. At each end of the tube, the process starts with the injection of a small quantity of hydrogen and helium gas. That gas is heated until the atoms lose their electrons, creating a donut of hot, glowing fuel known as a plasma. The plasma donuts at each end are then sent to the center of the device, where they collide and are crushed by additional magnetic fields. The machine rapidly squeezes the fuel to over 100 million degrees and pressures above 250 atmospheres, allowing the helium and hydrogen to fuse. ""When fusion happens, it pushes back on the magnetic field,"" Kirtley explains. ""We directly recover electricity from the magnetic field."" It's a bold, and potentially highly efficient way to generate electricity from fusion, but it's also enormously challenging. The hot plasma gasses struggle to escape their magnetic confinement, and getting the hydrogen and helium to stick requires an enormous amount of heat and compression — more so than other kinds of fusion fuels. Researchers had struggled to make similar designs work during the early days of fusion research, but Kirtley thinks the concept deserves a second look. High-speed electronics, fiber optics and advanced, solid-state switches all make it possible to heat and compress the fusion fuel much more quickly than in the past — lessening the time it has to escape from its magnetic confines. ""The faster we go, the more we can compress it, the more we can heat it, the more fusion we can get out of it,"" he says. The company has already built six generations of devices, showing steady improvement. Kirtley says he believes the next machine, known as Polaris, will be able to produce more electricity than it requires — a crucial milestone known as ""break even."" Polaris, which is under construction in the next warehouse over, is expected to begin operation in 2024. Kirtley believes that they will prove they can extract electrical power from the device by the end of next year, though it's not clear whether the power out will exceed the power in. Helion is hardly the only game in town: In fact, just five minutes up the road, a rival startup is trying a different approach. The company, known as Zap Energy, uses another system known as a Z-pinch to try and generate power. Zap's concept is simpler than Helion's — a current is driven through the fusion fuel, heating it up. The same current generates a magnetic field around the fuel that squeezes it. Zap Energy's Fuze device generates nuclear fusion with every shot. The company hopes future generations of the machine will put out more energy than they require. Geoff Brumfiel/NPR hide caption Zap Energy's Fuze device generates nuclear fusion with every shot. The company hopes future generations of the machine will put out more energy than they require. ""I don't want to call it 'just a lightning bolt,' because that makes it sound simple,"" says Ben Levitt, the vice president of research and development at Zap. If the fuel can be heated and squeezed quickly and strongly enough, then the fusion it produces should exceed the energy put in. Like Helion, Zap's concept isn't new — government researchers tried to make it work in the 1950s, but ran into trouble keeping the synthetic lightning bolt from breaking apart before fusion occurred. New research in the 1990s suggested a way around the problem, and Zap is now close to showing, at least in principle, whether it can produce fusion power. The company is funded with $200 million in venture capital from large corporations, including Chevron and Shell. Private capital has been flowing into fusion research in recent years, with new investments topping $2.8 billion in 2022, according to the Fusion Industry Association, a fusion trade group. Some 25 companies are now operating in the U.S., and they're pursuing a wide variety of designs — some use lasers to squeeze the fuel, like the large government experiment that just had a breakthrough, while others use magnets to hold the fuel in a donut shape. Levitt says that the private money is allowing researchers like him to work in a different way: ""There's no red tape, we're properly funded for making bold decisions on engineering,"" he says. ""That's the thesis of the private fusion company."" Zap Energy's Ben Levitt says that investment is allowing them to sprint towards their goal of building a commercial fusion reactor: ""There's no red tape."" Geoff Brumfiel/NPR hide caption Zap Energy's Ben Levitt says that investment is allowing them to sprint towards their goal of building a commercial fusion reactor: ""There's no red tape."" The attraction for investors is fairly simple: ""Fusion is the ultimate energy source,"" says Phil Larochelle, a partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private venture capital firm that's investing in four fusion companies, including Zap. Fusion is far more efficient than chemical energy sources like oil and gas. ""It's got a million-fold improvement in energy density over what we use now, and also if we can get it to work it's basically infinite, free, accessible to all, and if we get it right, carbon-free,"" he says. ""Abundant intelligence and abundant energy are two of the most important inputs to a much better future,"" Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and an investor in Helion, told NPR via text message. Helion, he says, is ""great tech for cheap clean safe energy (and lots of it)."" It's too bad that the line, 'Fusion is 30 years away and always will be,' is so catchy. In fact there's been a huge amount of progress in fusion, starting in the 1960s. Phil Larochelle, Breakthrough Energy Ventures Larochelle says the moment is ripe for private industry to back a breakthrough, largely because of decades of government work that's been done to advance fusion science. ""It's too bad that the line, 'Fusion is 30 years away and always will be,' is so catchy,"" he says. ""In fact there's been a huge amount of progress in fusion, starting in the 1960s."" And the government is attempting to bootstrap the current commercial interest. In May, the U.S. Department of Energy announced it would invest $46 million into eight companies, including Zap, to try and speed the development of commercial fusion power. The current moment ""is very exciting,"" says Anne White, professor of nuclear science at MIT. ""We've always had basic research, but we didn't have companies and private investors being willing to take a lot of that and translate it."" The sprint is now on to see whether these new takes on old approaches can work. While neither Helion or Zap was willing to provide an exact date for when their devices might produce net power, both spoke in terms of a year or two, as opposed to decades. But can they actually do it? ""I think that's to be determined,"" says Carlos Paz-Soldan, an associate professor of applied physics at Columbia University in New York. With fusion, the devil has always been in the details. Things like turbulence in the hot plasma gas can cause it to leak out before fusion occurs. And sometimes instabilities turn up unexpectedly as devices increase in size or power. Helion employees assemble a capacitor for one of the company's machines. Geoff Brumfiel/NPR hide caption Helion employees assemble a capacitor for one of the company's machines. Paz-Soldan says that the current spike in private investment came at the end of the pandemic, when debt was cheap. ""When interest rates were low, people were willing to make long-term bets,"" he says. He does believe the large quantity of money that's flowed privately into fusion will advance the field. ""The level of investment was substantial, and it should yield technological progress,"" he says. But with interest rates high again, investor willingness to take risks going forward will be lower. If companies can't show significant progress, he thinks they may not be able to raise more money in future rounds. Indeed, the latest report from the Fusion Industry Association showed that new investment was down substantially in 2023. White says she's optimistic that the current sprint in private industry will produce results. While getting electricity on the grid may take a while, she believes that one of several compact systems will soon produce more energy than it consumes: ""I think in five years we're going to see it,"" she says. ""I really hope we do."" Back at Helion's manufacturing facility, David Kirtley is aware of the headwinds facing an advanced technology company like his, but he's also optimistic about the future. Helion's last funding round raised enough money to complete both construction of its current machine and begin work on the full design of a power plant. There's an old quote in the field, he says: ""We will have fusion when the world needs fusion."" The world has never needed it more than it does today, Kirtley argues — and he hopes that his company will be the one that delivers.

Chicago Tribune,Chicago high schooler among 6 area activists who will give young people a voice at global climate summit in Dubai,2023-12-04 05:00:00,Adriana Pérez,"Danica Sun, 17, recalls the first moment she felt the call to do something for the environment was a bit cliché: As an elementary school kid, she was unnerved by one of the many viral photos of bedraggled, emaciated polar bears floating on melting slabs of ice.But the issue really hit home a few years later when she was working on a school report about permafrost — a frozen layer of soil below the ground’s surface — thawing in the Arctic and releasing thousands of tons of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.“I realized that climate change isn’t just some future issue that only impacts polar bears,” Sun said. “I realized it’s happening now and it impacts me and everyone around me, and especially my generation. At that point, I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I really need to do something about this.’”Now, the high school senior’s activism has taken her to a faraway land and one much warmer than the North Pole — Dubai in the United Arab Emirates — for the 28th annual United Nations Climate Change conference or COP28. The summit, which runs through Dec. 12, brings together thousands of people, including politicians, business leaders, climate experts and environmental advocates from around the world.The global summits are convened to find ways to address the climate crisis, such as limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, helping vulnerable communities adapt and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.“Growing up, I was always a really quiet girl and I never would have imagined going to something like this,” Sun told the Tribune over the phone before her trip overseas. “But I think … to bring about widespread, real change, I can’t just do it myself. I have to be out there, using my voice.”Sun, who is from Chicago, is one of six area students who arrived in the Middle Eastern country Saturday to participate in the conference. They are the COP28 delegates from a local youth environmental advocacy program called It’s Our Future.“They’re very much of a team. They just knock me out every day,” said program manager Rachel Rosner, who is chaperoning the young activists this week. “It’s a huge privilege to have the capacity to empower young people to make a difference, to connect them.”Rosner said that COVID-19, school shootings and climate change are just some of the many issues younger generations have to deal with, which has made some youths wise beyond their years. But other young folks might feel paralyzed by how enormous the issues are — so giving them the tools to do something about it, she said, feels really meaningful.One of the other young activists in the group is Natasha Bhatia, 17, a senior at Hinsdale Central High School, who with Sun, reestablished in 2022 the local chapter of Fridays For Future, the global climate movement that began in 2018 when Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg started organizing school strikes every Friday.“Chicago is such a big city,” Sun remembers thinking. “We have to be a leader in the climate movement.”The two young women met and became friends through It’s Our Future before they decided to restart the local strikes. Bhatia said she believes young people are crucial to the climate movement, so even though she is excited to be attending COP28, she also recognizes “the gravity” of speaking with world leaders on behalf of others her age.“Our voices can be really powerful in making a change, and I think that a lot of youth don’t feel that way right now,” she said. “But I want to be that voice, that wake-up call for others that you can make a difference. Whether it’s in your community, whether it’s at your state level, whether it’s at a national or global level. You can make a difference.”At the conference, the six young activists will connect with politicians and other leaders from their generation, but they will also represent the thousands of Chicagoans who are facing the alarming consequences of climate change.On Friday, Bhatia will talk at a panel titled “Dear World Leaders” and hosted by the U.S. Department of State. Afterward, Sun will participate in a roundtable discussion to express her hopes and demands for change with U.S. political figures, including John Kerry, former secretary of state and now the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate.Sun will also participate in three panels during the conference, two concerning youth mental health in the face of climate disaster and one about using climate literacy to advance climate justice.To inform her discussions at the international conference, Sun said she plans to draw from her activism experiences, which include improving sustainability at her school, leading strikes and working with state legislators.She said her initial concerns about climate change led her to adopt a vegan diet and thrift all her clothes, but over time she realized something that broadened her approach to environmentalism.“My ideas really are only as powerful as my ability to communicate them and influence others to change,” she said.As a student at the Illinois Math and Science Academy in Aurora, Sun is co-president of the environmental club, where she helps plan educational and community engagement events. She is also involved in implementing a municipal composting initiative to reduce food waste at the boarding school, where students eat three meals a day.At the state level, Sun and other members of It’s Our Future have been part of a group pushing for a climate literacy bill in the Illinois General Assembly, working closely with Rep. Kimberly du Buclet, a Chicago Democrat. Similar to a law in New Jersey, which in 2020 began requiring public schools to teach about climate change in most subjects and across grade levels, the Illinois bill would introduce a climate curriculum to empower students and their families to take meaningful climate action.But the group’s literacy efforts go beyond the classroom.“It’s making sure everyone is aware of these really personal impacts of climate change, and also that they’re aware of the benefits of climate solutions,” Sun said. “So, for example, adopting electric vehicles (allows for) cleaner air, leading to lower asthma rates, lower premature deaths. … These climate solutions, they’re not just good for the earth, they’re good for you.”Sun is also on the leadership team of Climate Reality Chicago, part of a national nonprofit for climate change education and advocacy founded by Al Gore, environmentalist and former vice president of the United States — whom she hopes to meet at COP28.The local chapter of Climate Reality has largely focused on electrification, and Sun excitedly remembers attending board meetings and public hearings to encourage Pace — Chicago’s suburban bus system and one of the largest services in North America — to commit to zero emissions by 2040 and establish fully electric fleets.“Fossil fuels cannot be a part of my future,” Sun said, reflecting on the centrality of clean energy in her advocacy efforts. “They must be phased out to ensure that I have a safe and habitable planet to live in and that I can ensure one for my children as well.”Sun said people in her generation can be discouraged when they are immediately dismissed if they bring up climate change during dinner. So she has a message for the adults at the table.“A lot of youth have this burden of the climate crisis; we are the ones who are trying to fight for a habitable planet to grow older in,” Sun said. “I believe that we need adults to support and empower us, and also to shake up and go into this fight along with us. … This summer, when we saw the smoke floating across North America, all these floods — I really saw a glimpse (of) what my future will look like. And I think it’s a lot for people my age to deal with.”At 11 a.m. Central time on Wednesday, Sun and Bhatia will speak live from Dubai during a virtual webinar for Chicago high school classes and clubs.

Politico,Labor unions are still giving Democrats climate headaches,2023-12-04 05:00:00,Alex Nieves,"LOS ANGELES — One of California’s most powerful unions is not loosening its grip on oil jobs.Despite the Biden administration and California lawmakers pouring billions of dollars into new climate-friendly industries like electric vehicles, hydrogen and building electrification, a key player in state politics is still defending fossil fuel interests that provide thousands of well-paying jobs.President Joe Biden’s investment in clean energy sectors through a pair of massive spending bills — which promise lucrative tax credits for projects that pay union wages — was supposed to speed up the labor transition away from oil and gas. That hasn’t happened in deep-blue California, home to the country’s most ambitious climate policies — and most influential labor unions.“We believe we’re still going to be working in the oil and gas space for the foreseeable future,” said Chris Hannan, president of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, which represents nearly 500,000 members across dozens of local unions, from pipefitting to electrical work.Unions’ longstanding — and well-founded — distrust of the renewable energy industry as a reliable source of labor-friendly jobs is slowing the “just transition” that Biden, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic leaders around the country have pushed.With federal officials trying to get clean energy funding out as fast as possible ahead of the 2024 election, and California politicians cracking down on the fossil fuel industry, unions’ reluctance to relinquish fossil fuel jobs undermines Democrats’ aggressive climate targets, according to a lawmaker who serves both a union- and oil-rich area of the state.While the union embrace of fossil fuels is unique to California — one of the few blue states with significant oil production — the struggle highlights a larger question over how states can quickly build massive amounts of clean energy infrastructure without undercutting labor.“We’re at that crucial fork in the road,” said state Sen. Anna Caballero (D-Salinas), who represents the Central Valley. “The impact of making the wrong decisions is going to be long-lasting and pretty devastating. I don’t think that it’ll be easy to undo the damage.”The Trades’ ties to California’s fossil fuel industry date back more than a century. Its workers have benefited from project labor agreements with major corporations like Chevron, which guarantee projects are staffed by union employees and set wages, benefits, hours and other labor standards before workers step on a job site. These collective bargaining agreements are less common in renewable energy sectors, where companies are often resistant to working with unions.And despite a steady decline in the state’s oil production since the mid-1980s, California is still the seventh largest producer of crude oil in the United States and ranks third in oil refining capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.This relationship makes the Trades a key ally for oil and gas, which has watched its political influence in Sacramento wane in recent years.“Certain parts of the Trades are extra sensitive to the main industries they work for,” said state Sen. Henry Stern (D-Sherman Oaks). “When Chevron rings the alarm, okay, that’s tens of thousands of jobs there, so we’ve got to be super attentive.”The Trades, alongside the oil industry, fought against legislation last year to create a buffer zone between oil and gas wells and sensitive locations like homes and schools. That bill passed, but is on hold after oil companies bankrolled a referendum that will put the question of whether it can be enacted on the November 2024 ballot.The union also opposed a bill in the California Legislature this fall that requires large businesses to report greenhouse gas emissions through their supply chains. The bill passed, but the Trades’ opposition — on the grounds that the bill would increase costs for in-state businesses, making them less competitive — carried more weight than the oil companies’ among the state’s increasingly progressive Democratic supermajority.“We believe we should be making things better, not overly burdensome for the sake of making things overly burdensome,” Hannan said. “We need to have business in the state of California. We need to all have places to work.”The Trades aren’t reflexively opposed to green jobs. Offshore wind has the potential to be a bright spot: The group’s immediate past president, Andrew Meredith, joined offshore wind developer RWE Energy in July as director of labor relations.“As long as there are technologies that are ready to come out of the ground as we’re losing other segments of the energy sector, I think you’re going to see a pretty smooth transition,” Meredith said.The United Steelworkers, whose members operate oil refineries around the state, has endorsed a 12-year transition roadmap developed by economists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which proposes California spend $470 million annually to support workers laid off from fossil fuel jobs. In October, USW joined a new labor coalition, including chapters from United Auto Workers, Service Employees International Union and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, that released policy priorities including wage replacement, healthcare coverage, retraining and relocation support for displaced workers.But the sheer number of jobs required is an obstacle. The Trades is not signed on as a member of that labor coalition, and has pushed back against proposals that put a timeline on the phaseout of fossil fuels, arguing there aren’t enough well-paying green energy jobs yet to offer all its members.California has around 112,000 workers in fossil fuels, compared to 115,000 in the solar industry, according to the Energy Department. Those fossil fuel jobs pay around $30,000 more annually than solar, the highest paying clean energy sector, a union-commissioned report found.That same report estimates that a 50 percent reduction in the oil and gas sectors by 2030 — as envisioned under state policy that aims for carbon neutrality by 2045 — would require more than 30,000 workers to find new jobs.“We don’t really have a great plan for building high-quality, unionized jobs in the clean economy in the industrial sector,” said Sam Appel, a researcher at UC Berkeley’s Labor Center who wrote a report finding that around $13 billion out of $32 billion in state climate investments isn’t connected to workforce standards.“There’s a lot of risk in proceeding without a plan or without making sure that the workers, the community, and the path to decarbonization are all being very carefully tended to, because when you leave one out, you’re going to run into political problems,” he said.Fighting between unions and renewable energy companies, which have cited costs in pushing for nonunion workforces, has added another layer of difficulty. Nowhere is that clearer than in the rooftop solar industry, which has drawn criticism even from environmental groups.“We want to make sure that we learned that lesson, and that we’re not using new industries as a way to undermine labor standards,” said Alex Jasset, director of Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles’ energy justice program.Divisions on the left over emerging technologies that are getting the most generous subsidies are also complicating the effort. Environmental groups are trying to slow down hydrogen and carbon capture projects, arguing they’ll prolong reliance on fossil fuels.A growing number of state lawmakers see these technologies as part of the plan to build trust with unions and offer workers an off ramp from fossil fuel jobs. Hannan sits on the board of ARCHES, a federally-funded hydrogen project that will be largely based in the Central Valley, home to the majority of the state’s fossil fuel jobs.That specific project has drawn criticism from environmental groups who say it’s pulling attention away from what should be a focus on bolstering the state’s electric power capacity.“Hydrogen projects are being rolled out that really might not have any climate benefit and will be a huge waste of financial resources,” Jasset said. “As much as we want to build a relationship with labor, we will have to speak out against that because it’s a bad use of funds for the kinds of transitions that we need.”Caballero, a moderate Democrat who has opposed some progressive climate legislation, called the opposition a knee-jerk reaction based on the oil industry’s interest in hydrogen.“There is federal money — billions of dollars that are available from the federal government to move us in the right direction,” he said. “And that would put people to work tomorrow.”But that sentiment is growing among even reliably pro-environment Democrats, who hope to bring the Trades to their side.“Some of these splits over things like carbon removal and hydrogen are to me missed opportunities, where I don’t think the answer can just be, ‘Heck, no,’” Stern said. “Because there’s the olive branch in the trades, right? Hey, let’s use these fields for something, or let’s use these refineries for something.”",9176,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/04/california-unions-oil-green-jobs-00129724,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/e129cea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F75%2F0b%2F6af8f6784cbbba4d869874fbd7d7%2Fca-california-oil-gas-leases-29184.jpg,Climate and Environment,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,economy sentiment central base developed center council bring anna democrat resistant past tend director uc carry put timeline crude henry common producer standard supply usw thousand responsibility board answer grow impact back october fork call push leader official focus attention miss gov agreement seventh key highlight rooftop progressive hold country blue funding reluctance company infrastructure tax reflexively proceed refinery massive green long quickly future set pull overly million legislation decarbonization government player learn president sensitive laid moderate labor happen solar transition capture problem financial largely relinquish bill federal nonunion work aggressive powerful lesson undercut community part gavin accord refining increasingly envision speed burdensome politics despite majority local branch release field coverage massachusetts sam pipefitting easy argue legislature jasset group lawmaker oak coalition fast away collective investment location hey fund july ahead write home spend electric pay alex removal year opposition developer benefit sheer roll major spot represent hydrogen amount super trust politician layer watch report compare reduction industrial build pass unionized require foreseeable worker space relocation caballero available job smooth devastate support promise olive policy waste great bolster extra source bargaining estimate staffed speak direction heck federation difficulty arch reliable rank immediate include retrain ring electrical joe emerge election municipal justice relationship large healthcare social sacramento suppose cost ally number target business emission alarm operate influence potential money distrust ten american make ramp wrong clearer power political service enact member grip dozen tie kind neutrality california pretty high alongside leave technology percent oppose left industry bright connect roadmap undermine criticism plan date dollar valley displace run reliably chris school biden proposal proposes sits influential possible prolong segment clean amherst generous split administration provide step unique join rwe zone ambitious newsom lot crack increase wane wage chain defend reliance longstanding production resource fossil struggle crucial question site trade building chevron carefully state project specific vehicle ready capacity department economist fuel chapter place andrew opportunity angeles reaction believe aim stern electrification berkeley phaseout steelworker pair meredith serf renewable undo slow hour offer lucrative spending move drawn credit bankroll complicate recent offshore union energy area add international environmental construction sector significant wind buffer sake fought annually fall huge century endorse road carbon steady decision greenhouse loosening risk information undermines path county create referendum researcher billion lose workforce hope appel auto corporation gas find sign climate november priority replacement united decline obstacle competitive university effort weight subsidy employee ground physician guarantee hannan democratic embrace oil interest,0.9936,0.065387968613775,10.939511031604056,0.4951000388500388,0,2023-12-04
Politico,Open secret at climate talks: The top temperature goal is mostly gone,2023-12-03 07:00:00,Chelsea Harvey,"Leading scientists worldwide delivered a striking dose of reality to the United Nations on Sunday: it’s “becoming inevitable” that countries will miss the ambitious target they set eight years ago for limiting the warming of the Earth.The ominous estimate points to the growing likelihood that global warming will shoot past 1.5 degrees Celsius before the end of this century, inflicting what scientists describe as an overwhelming toll from intensifying storms, drought and heat on people and the economy. It also injects an urgent message into global climate talks in Dubai, where the debate over ramping down fossil fuels is set to flare over the next two weeks.Surpassing the temperature threshold — even temporarily — would be a major blow to the international Paris climate agreement from 2015, which called for nations to keep global temperatures well within 2 degrees Celsius of their preindustrial levels, and within 1.5 degrees if at all possible. The findings come amid climate talks that for the first time are focused on taking stock of whether almost 200 nations are meeting that goal. Early indications offer a bleak picture.The 1.5-degree target has become a rallying point for nations attending the COP28 climate talks, despite rising certainty among scientists that the world will spill over that threshold, potentially within a decade. Temperatures have already risen between 1.1 and 1.3 degrees.It may be possible to bring global temperatures back down again, using still-unproven technological means to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. But at least some overshoot is probably unavoidable, scientists said in the new report to the U.N.The looming shadow of overshoot is one of 10 stark warnings the researchers presented Sunday in an annual report on top climate science insights from the past year. Launched in 2017, the series is coordinated by scientific organizations Future Earth and Earth League, alongside the World Climate Research Programme, whose scientific work helps inform national climate commitments worldwide. The report is presented each year to the U.N. during its annual climate conference.This year’s report includes a variety of findings.Mountain glaciers are swiftly shrinking. Natural landscapes, like forests and wetlands, may soak up less carbon dioxide as the planet warms, causing more pollution to linger in the atmosphere. Compound climate events — multiple extreme weather disasters happening at the same time or in rapid succession — are a growing threat.The report also includes insights on the links between climate change and biodiversity loss, the role that food systems can play in reducing carbon emissions, the plight of global populations that lack resources to relocate in the face of worsening climate impacts, and the importance of just and equitable climate adaptation efforts.But its findings on the 1.5-degree target are among its starkest conclusions.Nations have not reduced greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to stay on track, the report finds. The world can emit only a certain amount of carbon before the 1.5-degree target slips out of reach, and recent studies suggest that threshold will arrive in about six years if humans keep burning carbon at their current rates.Avoiding overshoot could still be technically possible — but that would require “truly radical transformations,” the report cautions. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s top authority on climate science, says global emissions must fall by a whopping 42 percent within the next six years to keep the target alive. And they must spiral down to net zero by midcentury.Even then success would be “only a maybe,” said Nico Wunderling, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the report’s authors.Many scientists have long concluded privately that the world will at least temporarily miss that target. But that likelihood has only recently begun to surface in high-profile reports.“It was already kind of an elephant standing in the room that we may actually not hold 1.5 degrees without an overshoot,” Wunderling said.Many experts now say the best case scenario is if nations can limit overshoot as much as possible — ideally capping it at fractions of a degree — and bring temperatures back down as swiftly as possible.The consequences of global warming worsen with every incremental amount the planet warms, scientists say. And some climate impacts can’t be reversed once they’re set in motion, like sea level rise or plant and animal extinctions.That means 1.5 degrees should remain a centerpiece of the Paris Agreement, Wunderling said. Keeping that target in focus can motivate world nations to limit overshoot as much as possible.“Minimizing the magnitude of overshoot, but also the duration of overshoot, is what the best case scenario really is,” Wunderling said.That means global efforts to remove carbon dioxide from the sky must rapidly expand, the report adds. These methods can include everything from natural strategies, like planting forests, to constructing giant carbon-guzzling machines that suck the pollution directly out of the air — assuming the technology can be advanced to work at a large enough scale.The IPCC has concluded that at least some carbon removal is essential to achieving net zero emissions by midcentury. Some sectors of the economy likely can’t get off fossil fuels that quickly, and their greenhouse gas emissions would have to be offset by pulling equal amounts of carbon dioxide out of the air.Eventually, some experts hope humans can also use carbon dioxide removal to lower global temperatures to safer levels. That means drawing out more carbon than goes into the atmosphere.Carbon dioxide removal isn’t a substitute for rapidly and immediately reducing emissions, the report warns. But it does need to swiftly scale up in order to limit overshoot as much as possible.Meanwhile, rapidly phasing out fossil fuels is also key to limiting overshoot.The emissions associated with existing fossil fuel infrastructure alone would already put the Paris targets out of reach, the report finds. Yet governments, companies and investors continue to build more fossil fuel projects.“Consequently, governments and financial institutions need to actively plan for and implement a fossil fuel phase-out while accelerating the phase-in of renewable energy, aiming for a comprehensive and coordinated energy transition,” the report states.This year’s climate conference is expected to feature a major debate between countries calling for a phase-out of all fossil fuels versus countries that want to soften the language to a “phase-down.”The weaker language could result in slower global efforts to reduce emissions, some experts argue. It could open up the possibility that nations continue to burn fossil fuels, relying on the promise of carbon capture or carbon removal technology to clean up afterward, said Ploy Achakulwisut, a researcher with the Stockholm Environment Institute Asia and one of the report’s authors, in an email.Another author, Gregor Semieniuk, an assistant research professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, referred to COP28 when he said, “These documents shape narratives that then, in turn, shape investment decisions and markets to some extent.”Weaker language doesn’t necessarily commit the world to missing the Paris targets, he noted. The world could still proceed with strong enough mitigation efforts and climate financing to phase out fossil fuels.“But it matters for sentiments and discussions, and therefore I think ‘phase out’ is pushed for by those who take this really seriously,” he added.Historically, U.N. climate talks have avoided mentions of fossil fuels in their final decisions. Fossil fuels appeared in a decision text for the first time in 2021, at the conference in Glasgow, Scotland, when nations agreed to phase down — not phase out — coal.Last year’s conference in Egypt reiterated that commitment, despite a push from many countries to adopt a phaseout of all fossil fuels. But the rapid approach of the 1.5-degree threshold calls for higher ambitions, the new report suggests.“Raising the ambition and quality of the commitment language around fossil fuel phase-out would be an important first step towards achieving a 1.5C-aligned, rapid, well-managed, and equitable energy transition,” Achakulwisut said.A version of this report first ran in E&E News’ Climatewire.

Washington Post,A super solar storm rocked Earth in 1872. They’re more common than you think.,2023-12-03 06:00:00,Kasha Patel,"Around 11:30 p.m. on Feb. 4, 1872, the sky above Jacobabad suddenly brightened, as if a portal to heaven had opened. A passerby watched in amazement and terror, while a pet dog became motionless, then trembled. The godly glow morphed, from red to bright blue to deep violet, until morning.Electric communication cables mysteriously glitched in the Mediterranean, around Lisbon and Gibraltar, London and India. Confused telegraph operators in Cairo reported issues in sending messages to Khartoum. One incoming message asked what was the big red glow on the horizon — a fire or a faraway explosion?The source was in fact 90 million miles away. A surge of particles from our fiery sun bombarded Earth’s upper atmosphere, generating a geomagnetic storm that painted skies and disrupted electric systems.Now, newly uncovered data show that this February 1872 event ranks among the top three greatest geomagnetic storms to hit Earth on record. The findings reveal that these large events — super geomagnetic storms — are more common than researchers previously realized, posing a major risk if one hit today’s technology-heavy society.“The intensity of the solar geomagnetic storm was excessively large and possibly one of the largest,” said Hisashi Hayakawa, the study’s lead author. “Such a strong geomagnetic storm would completely mess up modern civilization.”The most intense super geomagnetic storm is said to be the Carrington Event in September 1859, named after the British astronomer who helped shed light on it. The storm brought glowing lights, or auroras, as far as Tahiti — a major surprise since most aurora congregate around Earth’s poles. Spikes of electricity paralyzed the world’s telegraph systems, halting messages.The Carrington Event was thought to be a one-of-kind, freak occurrence, but scientists are learning that is not true.Another super geomagnetic storm occurred in May 1921, the largest geomagnetic storm of the 20th century. The storm, sometimes referred to as the New York Railroad storm, brought spectacular nighttime aurora. It also interrupted and damaged telephone and telegraph systems linked to railroad systems in New York City and around the state.Now, the new study adds a third storm — from February 1872 — to the geomagnetic hall of fame, ranking as intense, if not more intense, than the others by some measures. The storm pushed aurora even farther south than the Carrington Event, causing magnetic disturbances on Earth equal to or worse.“Some of the colors that are mentioned in this event in terms of auroral coloring and then the behavior, in my mind, are even more explicit than what was documented in the [Carrington] event,” said Delores Knipp, co-author and space physicist at the University of Colorado at Boulder. “It is likely that the level of magnetic disturbance or perturbation is every bit as large as the Carrington Event.”Analyzing an event that you didn’t witness in person takes a bit of detective work.Formal scientific observations of the event were limited in 1872, but researchers found upward of 700 reports of the event from overlooked sunspot records, magnetic field records, newspaper clips, telegraph operators, ship records and whatever else was available.Using the documents, Hayakawa and his colleagues at the U.S. National Solar Observatory and the Royal Observatory of Belgium assessed the storm’s intensity, duration and origin. They also reconstructed the conditions to see how far the aurora probably extended during the storm. The study took around six years to complete.The aurora was spotted in very unusual places close to the equator. A telegraph operator in Mumbai reported strong earth currents at 7:30 p.m. on Feb. 4, 1872, until 7 a.m. on Feb. 5, with the aurora plainly visible from 8:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. A news article stated the “aurora was brilliant in the extreme” in Aden. A bright arc was reported in Shanghai.“It was certainly surprising for scientists, as well, because India is far away from that magnetic pole,” said Hayakawa, a space physicist at Nagoya University in Japan. “Generally, in order to expand the auroral oval, that geographic area, we need a stronger geomagnetic storm.”But the origin of the massive storm was rather modest. Analyzing sunspot records, the team found the storm probably originated from a medium-size sunspot group. Extreme geomagnetic storms typically come from huge sunspots.“Even though they’re not perhaps all that large, the real thing that matters is the complexity” of the sunspot region, Knipp said. She said it is concerning that such an intense storm was created from a moderate sunspot group, but agencies across the world are helping to track and study these triggers on the sun — before they hit Earth.Three super geomagnetic storms in the last two centuries may not seem like a lot, but researchers say that’s too frequent for comfort.Space physicist Dan Baker, who was not involved in the research, said he is surprised to see another incredibly intense storm occurring relatively soon after the famed Carrington Event. He said the February 1872 event “adds to the sense that major, highly disruptive solar events and resulting geomagnetic storms are more prevalent than most people assume.”“If the sun is producing Carrington Events or greater disturbances essentially every solar cycle or even every other solar cycle, then we had better sit up and take notice,” said Baker, director of Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.In fact, such a super geomagnetic storm narrowly missed Earth in July 2012. A lot of media didn’t cover the potentially devastating event, but the storm was the most powerful in more than 150 years.A storm that size would cause a lot of issues on modern society, said Hayakawa. It would knock out energy, communication and satellite systems, which we’ve become so accustomed to in our daily lives.",5917,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/03/geomagnetic-largest-storm-earth-study/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,magnetic freak colorado modest spectacular limited satellite auroral frequent upper york geographic brought place powerful super mention great source terror colleague mumbai generate violet india overlook british glitched witness knipp faraway potentially concern learn confuse july september mind expand equal found reveal notice spot nighttime glow disruptive mile origin atmosphere energy delores interrupt occur geomagnetic size japan send research excessively big create city upward pose involve push bit unusual communication condition university person light mysteriously duration accustom portal motionless relatively measure mess clip extreme pole disrupt fire matter cover khartoum shed scientific behavior study jacobabad blue lisbon disturbance team aurora article passerby sun boulder completely color group bright observation refer sunspot message close observatory nagoya morph open record strong surprised field large possibly issue godly produce bombard solar add earth gibraltar deep watch congregate generally occurrence astronomer fame medium devastate storm explicit perturbation newspaper highly fiery result brighten order laboratory space hayakawa surprise royal surprising moderate region intense farther halt railroad atmospheric originate electricity probably fact south particle common famed physicist typically aden assess major risk arc horizon top system million author sky suddenly society red newly cycle level scientist brilliant mediterranean tremble narrowly news director lead spike rank national tahiti analyze term away london amazement lot heaven equator world researcher telegraph cairo telephone real life event intensity year extend reconstruct prevalent hall detective track current massive belgium incredibly finding baker operator surge realize today explosion hisashi paralyze huge complexity daily incoming agency century paint plainly previously area damage visible uncovered essentially electric modern data hit show trigger link carrington cable february report miss knock oval physic document state ship,0.9672,0.3549095825587291,10.430910763569456,0.5468702219766047,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,A blind but elusive critter that was presumed extinct is rediscovered,2023-12-03 06:00:00,Andrea Salcedo,"A blind mole thought since 1936 to be extinct was recently rediscovered in South African sand dunes using eDNA — a technique that collects skin cells living creatures shed “while they are busy with their lives,” the expedition’s leader said.The rediscovery of De Winton’s golden mole offers the chance to learn more about a tiny mammal that, so far, has been poorly understood by the scientific community. It also offers a chance to reinvigorate conservation efforts for the elusive critter and gives hope to efforts to find other species scientists presume to be extinct, said Cobus Theron, senior conservation manager for the Endangered Wildlife Trust and leader of the expedition.But trying to find the little fellow has been like playing a game of whack-a-mole in nature’s arcade.“It’s very difficult to understand them because they spend most of their lives underground,” Theron told The Washington Post. “They have superb abdominal muscles and they’ve got very strong pedal-like arms to move through the sand. They rely entirely on hearing for hunting so they must have superb sensory hearing.”A paper chronicling the search for the De Winton’s golden mole was published Nov. 24 in the scientific journal Biodiversity and Conservation.To find the mysterious mammal, Theron’s team from the Endangered Wildlife Trust and the University of Pretoria used a revolutionary technology called eDNA, meaning the environmental DNA that animals shed in their ecosystems.Theron’s team collected sand samples along the beaches and dunes on the northwest coast of South Africa — the only place De Winton’s golden mole had been seen previously — and then the crew sifted through those samples in a lab to isolate the eDNA.To differentiate De Winton’s golden mole from other mole species, the team used a DNA sample that had been maintained by a South African museum for decades.When the team compared their eDNA sequences to the sample, it was a clear match to the De Winton’s golden mole, their study reported.“This struck me as something that could change the game,” Theron said. “If the technique could find the De Winton’s golden mole, we could use it for any of the golden moles.”The team has since trapped at least one De Winton’s golden mole and photographed it. Theron wants to use the eDNA technique to continue mapping out the critter’s habitat and ensure their conservation in the face of ongoing residential developments and mining.“We need to secure the habitat. That’s an absolute priority,” Theron said. “The study and understanding comes later.”The three-year effort by Theron’s team to find the De Winton’s golden mole “is a story of hope,” Theron added. “It shows that there’s opportunity still — even in this day and age — to discover new things, learn more and conserve more.”And it comes just weeks after scientists announced that they had documented the existence of another mammal thought to have disappeared, Attenborough’s long-beaked echidna, during an expedition to Indonesia’s Papua province. A group of Oxford University scientists recorded images of the egg-laying mammal — which had been spotted only once, in 1961 — with remote trail cameras they set up this summer in the inhospitable Cyclops Mountains.",3227,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/03/dewinton-golden-mole-rediscovered-dna/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,muscle offer blind mammal golden meaning understand move discover find beach secure match mountain place residential museum recently rely environmental rediscovery mysterious oxford theron winton priority lab post south indonesia development play paper busy effort specie struck differentiate game learn hope call set rediscover sand underground biodiversity dna spot scientist endanger sift isolate manager technology conserve ongoing fellow told journal continue attenborough technique conservation edna mole photograph cobus poorly extinct image tiny entirely presume expedition week day age remote search washington disappear life skin cyclops change ensure papua sample africa difficult university summer sensory story pretoria senior african give opportunity coast existence echidna dune trap chronicle critter announce trail wildlife hunt northwest shed scientific study understood previously collect mapping reinvigorate team chance hearing cell publish trust elusive province group superb show creature revolutionary compare sequence community nature arm record living maintain inhospitable strong crew habitat camera abdominal animal add leader clear spend document absolute,0.9712,0.5577936163619461,9.70231647634584,0.4968655303030302,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,Oil companies at center of giant push to cut a potent greenhouse gas,2023-12-02 03:00:00,Timothy Puko,"The world’s leading oil producers, including those in the United States, are rolling out new plans in Dubai on Saturday to significantly reduce methane from their operations — potentially the most consequential action resulting from the first week of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP28.The effort comes as countries and companies face increasing pressure to act on a greenhouse gas that once was largely ignored but which is actually more than 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide. Negotiations in recent weeks have involved some of the world’s largest oil and industrial companies, banks, and top government officials from the United States and the Middle East pushing for a culmination of deals at the Dubai summit.At COP28 on Saturday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan detailed final standards to limit methane at U.S. oil and gas wells, a precursor to subsequent announcements. In a proposal first made two years ago, the agency had said it would put about 900,000 new and existing wells under more aggressive requirements for preventing and stopping leaks, a move the oil industry once fought for years but which many leading companies have grown to support or accept.The announcements reflect how the oil and gas industry — long vilified by climate activists — has become central to global climate negotiations, and to this summit in particular. UAE leaders see their host status as a chance to argue that fossil fuel producers are key to addressing climate change, even though their past and ongoing emissions are major drivers of rising temperatures.Because methane is so potent, U.S. officials and climate advocates are focusing on it as one of the fastest ways to limit the acceleration of global warming. If successfully implemented, the initiatives could be a historic climate achievement, supporters say.“If you add it all together, what it amounts to is really momentum building at a time when we really need it,” said Gina McCarthy, who once was President Biden’s top climate adviser and was the first to introduce methane limits on oil and gas operations as EPA administrator under President Barack Obama. “People are ready to rally around an answer.”Global efforts on methane have taken off in recent weeks, including a breakthrough at Sunnylands, Calif., in talks between U.S. climate envoy John F. Kerry and Xie Zhenhua, his counterpart from China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. China publicly committed for the first time to curbing methane and other greenhouse gases across its economy by 2035. That followed up on its previous announcement to push for new methane monitoring and controls by 2025.The Sunnylands deal included a planned summit on methane and other gases — those that aren’t carbon dioxide — which is scheduled for Saturday at COP28 with the UAE hosts. Observers and delegates consider it to be among the biggest events of the summit’s opening week, and many are also expecting the UAE will orchestrate a pact of companies committing to cut methane emissions.Former U.S. energy secretary Ernest Moniz, now a COP28 advisory committee member, said society needs large international coalitions to address climate change. Bringing in oil and gas companies is especially helpful to work at the scale required, he added.“I expect that COP28 will deliver,” Moniz said in an email.Methane has turned from an afterthought to a fixation for environmental groups and energy companies over the past 20 years as warming has accelerated and natural gas reshaped global energy markets. Some in both groups initially pitched vast and newly cheap supplies of natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal, a “bridge fuel” until fully carbon-free sources of energy could supplant fossil fuels. But new science then undercut those claims.Findings, especially from work pursued by the Environmental Defense Fund, showed that millions of leaks from minuscule to massive undid much of gas’s climate benefits by allowing raw methane simply to escape into the atmosphere. It ushered in a wave of regulatory crackdowns and political debates, and led oil and gas companies to spend millions to try to protect their businesses with new technology to detect and stop those leaks.Methane, in its raw form, is one of the most powerful forces at trapping heat. It accounts for more than half of the warming happening now from the greenhouse effect, though it makes up only a quarter of global emissions. Halving human methane emissions by 2030 could slow the rate of global warming by more than 25 percent and start a path to prevent 0.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100, according to 2021 research by a team of scientists from the Environmental Defense Fund and several U.S. universities.That has led to the U.S. team’s emphasis in talks with Beijing. Kerry has pushed for China and other countries to join the Global Methane Pledge, which aims to cut methane emissions 30 percent by the end of the decade. Further expanding this coalition and producing success at Saturday’s summit are among the top priorities for the delegation at COP28, U.S. officials have saidUAE’s Sultan Al Jaber — the oil executive who is leading the event — has pursued a similar agenda, prodding oil companies to accelerate an industry-wide commitment to reach near-zero methane emissions by 2030. He has said that more than 20 firms across oil and gas and heavy industry have committed, but he has not named them publicly, and questions remain about participation from giant national companies such as Saudi Aramco or the supermajors including ExxonMobil.The British giant BP began trying to limit those emissions as far back as the 1990s, but few others took interest because of low financial returns from the work, said John Browne, the company’s former chief executive. Companies need a combination of incentives and penalties to spur action — and the state-owned companies must be a part of the deal because they produce most of the world’s oil, he added.“It’s not material unless the state companies participate,” said Browne, who now has interest in a company that monitors methane emissions through satellite data. “It’s really important they pledge, and it’s even more important that we monitor it and what is said is done.”JPMorgan Chase — a major funder of energy companies — issued an analysis in the days leading up to COP28 encouraging oil and gas companies to aggressively reduce emissions, calling it an opportunity for both businesses and climate. It cited International Energy Agency estimates that the industry could eliminate more than 75 percent of its methane emissions with existing and well-known technology.Even so, levels of methane in the atmosphere have continued to rise. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recorded the fourth-largest annual increase last year since measurements began in 1983. Levels are now 2.5 times what they were in preindustrial times.The industry has made strides in producing oil and gas with less emissions, but only limited improvement, according to the IEA. Browne said what the United States is introducing — incentives passed by Congress last year and now the new regulations from the EPA — are the types of policies that can spur progress.Regan said that Biden was taking “strong action” Saturday. “We’ve crafted these technology standards to advance American innovation and account for the industry’s leadership in accelerating methane technology,” he said in a statement.The changes announced by the agency largely match the proposal it rolled out in phases over the past two years, and what environmental groups had asked for from the EPA. They include a phaseout of flaring at new wells; requirements for more leak monitoring with the help of new technology; limits on emissions from vulnerable equipment such as valves, pumps and storage tanks; and a program to spot giant, unintentional releases that are often short-lived but the biggest sources of methane emissions.The agency also will issue first-time guidance to states that will have to set reduction requirements on existing sources of methane. The Clean Air Act places the details of such plans in the hands of state agencies, and the EPA is giving them two years to complete those plans under these new rules, the federal agency said.It estimates the rule will cut methane emissions 80 percent from what would have been expected without the rule. That is an increase over what it had originally projected. That is because it strengthened provisions since then to further limit flaring, among other improvements to its method for analyzing the rule package’s impacts, the agency said.",8670,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/02/methane-emissions-greenhouse-gas-oil-epa/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain make middle increase potentially guidance incentive begin initially activist back method phaseout country historic chance key expect agency ongoing biden past gas official simply aramco provision secretary flare package delegation administration research team recent heavy account combination significantly pressure initiative pitch monitor afterthought envoy advisory priority advance market slow jpmorgan announce nation congress measurement action regulatory consider kerry michael accelerate participation driver roll push detailed human climate match chief continued gina especially protect equipment strengthen put low funder originally potent group unintentional ready act iea strong exist air rally scale largely produce advocate data methane undercut alternative member giant pact vast newly former week spur control summit material give culmination consequential particular add plan aggressively sultan stop raw central cheap place moniz defense sunnylands science british operation policy supplant oceanic saudi major saiduae atmosphere dioxide epa support celsius committee publicly participate innovation focus grown firm dubai analysis negotiation subsequent host heat pursue hand industry xie deal degree craft path move prod million coal breakthrough leadership big regan executive reduce bring source supporter administrator successfully uae quarter stride cleaner encourage energy pledge saturday company agenda tank impact president clean government fund oil building reach conference regulation event complete powerful detect storage barack vulnerable ushered day scientist limited include monitoring satellite introduce level emission deliver adviser international half producer lead ago financial rule natural leak penalty trap industrial zhenhua environmental interest limit previous time wave set amount decade technology happen delegate opportunity status show ernest minuscule force fully fast pass annual emitter precursor china emphasis reduction work fossil jaber accord pump commitment acceleration world reshaped orchestrate political preindustrial fixation east rise john counterpart supply estimate effort issue change important society call schedule question crackdown phase year fuel opening achievement long announcement address escape top chase success follow debate require bp effect standard analyze national release benefit federal record observer large coalition type bank implement commit fought join final browne atmospheric program rate spend bridge state eliminate supermajors spot business mccarthy requirement leader similar part aim global return beijing momentum carbon involve argue proposal reflect expand percent detail american greenhouse undid aggressive form halve protection obama prevent turn valve ignore project vilified result curb united talk start improvement massive helpful cut economy warm,0.99655,0.0692041522491349,11.39219195849546,0.4089871414674564,0,2023-12-02
Washington Post,Farmers race to innovate as climate change threatens African food supply,2023-12-02 02:00:00,Katharine Houreld,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Scientists, government officials and farmers are reviving neglected crops and boosting agricultural productivity in a race to cushion Africa from growing food shortages exacerbated by climate change. But only a trickle of donor funds and almost no private capital are directed to the small farmers who produce the vast majority of the continent’s food.Rising temperatures mean large chunks of Africa are whipsawing between increasingly severe droughts and more frequent and intense cyclones, threatening staple foods for hundreds of millions of people. The International Monetary Fund says each increase of 1 degree Celsius correlates to a 3 percent reduction in agricultural output in developing countries. It forecasts crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa will decline by 5 to 17 percent by 2050, despite a rapidly growing population. Smallholder farmers are already struggling.Increasing the notoriously low yields from African livestock and crops is one of the easiest ways to cut down on emissions, protect wildlife habitat and help farmers, said Enock Chikava, interim director of agricultural development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.But only 1.7 percent of global climate finance goes to projects with smallholder farmers, who produce around 80 percent of food in Africa and Asia. While wealthy nations have met a pledge to provide $100 billion annually to help developing countries achieve climate goals, African leaders meeting at COP28 in Dubai say they want funding for farmers to be vastly increased.“Change can only come with capital from the private sector,” said Amath Pathé Sene, head of the Africa Food Systems Forum.So far, that’s elusive. Unclear pricing and regulation and confusion over what is defined as a “climate solution” have kept most big investors away from climate adaptation in Africa, he said.The Climate Policy Initiative, which tracks global climate financing, says more than 95 percent of funding goes into projects focused on renewable energy, low-carbon transportation and energy efficiency.EthioChicken, set up in 2010 by three Americans in their mid-20s, is an exception — a private company that helps blunt the effects of climate change for smallholder farmers but still makes a profit. Chickens produce a fraction of the methane emissions of goats and cows and need far less water. Diversifying to high-yield chickens means farmers can hedge against crop failure with a cash stream that is also low carbon.The company’s clients are people like Ethiopian farmer Alem Garad. Normally, his wheat should be as high as his 10-year-old son, but this year a localized drought means the stunted sheaves are animal feed. Baby goats munch on the withered stalks. Yet the family is not hungry. Around 80 fat Sasso chickens squawk and scratch in his stone henhouse. EthioChicken imported the French breed for its hardiness, foraging ability and high egg production.Alem says the “ferengi,” or foreign, chickens lay about three times as much as his local “habesha,” or native highland, chickens. His wife has enough eggs left over after feeding their family of six to sell and buy grain. Birds sold for meat fetch double the price of a normal chicken, but it’s their high egg yield that makes them most popular.“If we didn’t have these chickens during the drought, we’d be very hopeless,” he said, a well-fed toddler clinging to his shin and giggling. “They provide what the crops would have.”The founders of EthioChicken, set up 13 years ago, hawked their first crop of chicks out of baskets strapped to motorbikes when a contract fell through. But now the company employs 1,600 people directly and 10,000 agents, and has been boosted by investments from the World Bank’s private arm, the International Finance Corp.; and the Gates Foundation. The company projects it will sell 35 million chicks this year and has expanded to five other countries under the umbrella Hatch Africa.Yet for now, climate disaster is outpacing innovation. The U.N. World Food Program says 170 million people in sub-Saharan Africa face severe hunger this year.East Africa has just suffered its worst drought in 40 years, and its sunbaked soils are now deluged by the worst flooding in a century. Of Africa’s 30 deadliest climate events ever, six have taken place in the past two years, Yale Climate Connections has found.More delicate crops such as wheat, rice and maize often fail under these conditions. Even hardier, traditional crops such as millet and cassava need to be bred into tougher strains, said Chiedozie Egesi, project director of the Next Generation Cassava Breeding Project and adjunct professor of plant breeding and genetics at Cornell University.In Nigeria, farmers in two states are conducting trials of new forms of cassava — a staple crop for 300 million people. The chunky roots are far more drought resistant than other staples, but intense cyclones and higher temperatures leave them vulnerable to rotting and pests. Yet there’s little funding or interest in cassava — not commonly consumed outside the continent — while the African Development Bank has set aside $1 billion to boost production of far less hardy wheat.Other projects are underway: insurance for payouts, linked to NASA weather data, for livestock farmers; tailored weather alerts for farmers sent via mobile phones; and renewed interest in neglected but hardy crops. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), a global innovation network, is setting up gene banks and crossbreeding more productive strains from traditional dryland crops like sorghum, millet and pigeon peas.But time may be running short. Extreme weather often feeds conflict, as people fight over water, arable land and grazing, or join armed groups for survival or access to food, said Hameed Nuru, director of the World Food Program’s African Union office.Hunger also fuels political instability, as populations reeling under inflation and starvation rally to demand change. In a world that is 2 degrees Celsius warmer, an additional 189 million people will be hungry, CGIAR says. At 4 degrees warmer, that will be 1.8 billion. Global temperatures broke the 2-degree barrier for the first time in November.",6235,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/12/02/cop28-africa-agriculture-climate-change/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,chikava make feed increase ferengi sheaf motorbike habesha investment cgiar henhouse renewable country temperature connection african past unclear agricultural official lay weather left hardy population research revive basket scratch client productive millet decline barrier hatch initiative rapidly fat plant animal yield smallholder hungry cyclone nasa finance nation transportation network gate consultative crossbreed whipsaw alem majority pathé deluge climate strain commonly strap grow sell century grazing head development starvation protect elusive deadliest low exception nuru giggle annually group conflict phone vastly forecast pest hopeless suffer rally produce increasingly data methane wealthy rot solution neglect vast define productivity land adjunct warmer genetics crop investor funding price director continent intense extreme normal diversify melinda reel place garad toddler staple run maize wife chick foreign direct failure stalk sene policy stream provide fell consume shortage achieve celsius instability leave flood develop bird fail innovation focus cling condition easy dubai forage grain addis ability buy fetch ethiopia degree million wither november livestock big additional confusion squawk company pledge energy access government localize race enock ethiopian fund private regulation egg alert resistant event breed rice vulnerable trial local underway conduct scientist hawk bill profit cushion away baby financing fraction donor emission founder ethiochicken dryland international hardiness ago import soil insurance ababa sector production egesi native broke arable interest time interim food set chunk gene drought notoriously farmer goal link pricing mobile meeting nigeria cash double fight reduction africa professor small meat outpace water shin stone monetary world severe track highland political chicken threaten exacerbate change chunky hunger goat year munch fuel capital wildlife blunt wheat root survival disaster stunt chiedozie effect hundred hedge sasso inflation agent yale cornell large billion frequent bank join sorghum pigeon renew cassava program high boost habitat payouts state amath arm system short leader global umbrella contract traditional expand percent foundation american despite form sunbaked correlate directly tailor family breeding hardier hameed cow adaptation employ generation delicate project trickle tougher asia output demand french union cut,-0.2899,0.144346431435445,11.204712230215826,0.4494518767711537,0,2023-12-02
Politico,Biden’s latest China crackdown puts his EV ambitions at risk,2023-12-01 08:45:00,James Bikales,"The Biden administration rolled out rules for electric vehicle tax credits on Friday that clamp down on Chinese imports — but threaten to slow the U.S. transition away from fossil fuels by slashing the number of cars that qualify.The long-awaited guidance on accessing the tax credits is emblematic of the minefield the Biden administration has had to navigate as it seeks to advance its ambitious climate agenda while at the same time breaking Chinese dominance of the batteries and critical minerals needed to fuel the transition to EVs.The rules disqualify a vehicle from receiving the credit if even one of its suppliers has loose ties to Beijing, such as producing parts in China or having as little as 25 percent of board seats controlled by China. In certain instances, even an American supplier merely relying on licensed Chinese technology could be barred from the credit under the new rules.It comes months after an earlier Treasury Department rule on domestic manufacturing locked out many vehicles from European, Japanese and South Korean automakers from receiving the tax credit. Around 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models currently qualify for the credit, less than one-fifth of the more than 100 models on the market.It’s not clear how many of those cars will remain eligible when the new rules take effect come January. The stringent rules are a victory for China hawks seeking to cut U.S. reliance on the country, while automakers like Ford — which is planning to license Chinese battery technology for a plant in Michigan — will need to reassess whether they can sell their cars with the tax break attached.Getting Americans behind the wheel of electric cars is a key pillar of President Joe Biden’s climate agenda, and the tax credit is his foremost lever to get them there. It can shave up to $7,500 off the price of an electric car, making them affordable for a new range of drivers.But Democrats in Congress imposed a series of escalating domestic content restrictions in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act aimed at cutting China out of the U.S. EV supply chain.While China still dominates that supply chain for key parts of the vehicles — notably the batteries used to power them — administration officials expressed confidence that automakers would be able to meet the new rules, highlighting the billions of dollars they are pouring into new U.S. manufacturing facilities.“Automakers have already adjusted the supply chain to ensure buyers are eligible for these credits and are continuing to do so,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told reporters. “These changes take time, but companies are making the investments and Americans are buying these cars.”The rules also offer some flexibility that automakers had sought, including a two-year phase-in period for enforcing the rule on some difficult-to-trace battery powders that go into their EVs.The Biden administration’s approach drew quick praise from Michigan Democrats, but was condemned by Republican China hawks.Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), who chairs the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said in a statement that the “naive new regulations would open the floodgates for American tax dollars to flow to Chinese companies complicit in trade violations and forced labor abuses.”The olive branches to automakers in the rule also drew the ire of one of the credit’s primary authors, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.). He threatened on Friday to introduce a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the rule and back a lawsuit against it.“This administration is, yet again, trying to find workarounds and delays that leave the door wide open for China to benefit off the backs of American taxpayers,” Manchin said in a statement. “I will take every avenue and opportunity to reverse this unlawful, shameful proposed rule and protect our energy security.”But Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) praised the administration for doing what it could to continue incentivizing EV adoption within the bounds set by the law.Industry representatives also welcomed the rules.“It’s a stringent rule that’s done thoughtfully and in a way that is workable for the industry,” said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.Gore said he expected the rule to reduce the number of models eligible for the federal credit — at least temporarily — but noted that “no possible interpretation” was likely to keep every model currently eligible on the list.“Anytime you’re introducing requirements like this … you’re extremely likely to see some models drop off,” Gore said. “That is totally normal and expected given that you cannot just flip a switch when it comes to supply chains.”John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most global automakers, said in a statement that the rules strike “a pragmatic balance” that will ensure “the list of eligible vehicles won’t completely disappear in 2024 (which was a real worry).”General Motors said in a statement that it continues to evaluate the rule but believes it is “well positioned to maintain the consumer purchase incentive for many of our EVs in 2024 and beyond.”Ford in a statement called the rules “detailed and extensive” and said it is reviewing their implications for its vehicles and the battery park in Michigan.Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, a trade group for foreign automakers, said in a statement that the group appreciates the “flexibility” the guidance provides for carmakers to leverage the credit.“While automakers in the U.S. are working to build up domestic supply chains and diversify their sourcing, this shift will take time,” Safavian said.The new rules, part of which take effect in January, come at a critical moment for EV adoption in the United States. The three largest American manufacturers — Tesla, General Motors and Ford — have each walked back some EV production targets in recent months, citing high interest rates and softening consumer demand. And Republicans are stepping up their attacks on Biden’s EV push on the Hill and the presidential campaign trail.Under the Inflation Reduction Act, automakers may not source any battery parts or critical minerals for vehicles eligible for the tax credit from a “foreign entity of concern,” beginning in 2024 and 2025, respectively. The law stipulates that China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are covered by the provision.But lawmakers left the administration with the tall task of defining which companies in those countries — as well as their joint ventures and American subsidiaries — would be subject to the ban.U.S. automakers and the EV industry argued the guidance should offer flexibility, since even though they have poured billions of dollars into expanding in America to meet the domestic content requirements, they haven’t had enough time to fully extricate their supply chains from China.Domestic industry groups and China hawks in both parties on the Hill pushed back, arguing for a strict approach to cut China out for good. Republicans and Manchin had warned the Treasury Department in recent weeks against providing any leeway to automakers to continue relying on Chinese suppliers.“Treasury guidance should make clear in the most comprehensive way possible that taxpayer subsidies cannot flow to foreign entities of concern through any structuring mechanism conceivable,” House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) wrote to the Treasury Department in September.Ultimately, the administration sought to thread the needle by issuing a relatively strict definition of the companies that would be subject to the ban, but offering automakers some flexibility in how it enforces the ban on some battery powders whose origins are hard to trace.The Treasury and Energy Departments issued separate but linked proposals to interpret the provision on Friday. While DOE’s rule sets a definition of “foreign entity of concern,” Treasury’s rule lays out how it applies to automakers seeking the EV tax credit.The DOE rule also applies to a $6 billion grant program it is administering to boost domestic battery production. That program, established by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, discourages applicants from sourcing battery materials from a “foreign entity of concern.”As many EV industry watchers had expected, DOE largely aligned its definition of “foreign entity of concern” with the Commerce Department’s interpretation of similar language in last year’s CHIPS and Science Act. The rule bars suppliers from accessing federal incentives if as little as 25 percent of the company’s stock, voting shares or board seats are held by people or businesses based in a country like China.That’s stricter than the 50-percent threshold contained in other parts of the Internal Revenue Code. And some aligned with the auto industry argued that the 25-percent definition alone would likely disqualify many EV models from the credit.But DOE also went further than the CHIPS definition in determining that a company could be considered a foreign entity of concern if it agrees to license technology from a Chinese firm and that Chinese company exercises “effective control” over production.Some Republican lawmakers, like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), had pushed Treasury to include licensing agreements in its definition of the provision in a bid to target Ford’s agreement to license advanced battery tech from China’s largest battery manufacturer for a planned factory in Michigan.Ford has insisted that its deal with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. will send no taxpayer dollars back to Beijing, and argues the agreement is necessary to allow it to become the first automaker to manufacture next-gen lithium, iron and phosphate batteries in the United States, rather than buying them from China.A senior administration official, speaking anonymously to brief reporters on the rule, said that DOE had “not evaluated any specific plan or [automaker] situation” for eligibility under the licensing rule. But Ford has said it will own and operate the Michigan facility, which could spare it from the “effective control” threshold in the interpretation.Gore praised DOE’s approach to licensing agreements for distinguishing between “purely a payment of a licensing fee for using a technology for which another company has a patent” and an arrangement that amounts to a “joint venture by another name.”“Licensing of IP [alone] does not make the licensee a foreign entity of concern,” Gore said. “It would be a mistake to place an arbitrary constraint on that that we wouldn’t place on any other industry.”The rule proposed by Treasury puts additional requirements on automakers to comply with the DOE restrictions. Carmakers will need to physically trace battery cells throughout their supply chain to ensure a foreign entity of concern isn’t involved, and face severe penalties if they try to get around the rules.But Treasury’s rule also proposes some measures to help automakers comply with DOE’s definition in the short term, including an exception through 2026 for certain low-value battery minerals that are difficult to trace to their origins.Such “de minimis” exceptions are a fairly common practice in trade policy, including in treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement and its Trump-era successor, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.Bozzella called the exemption “significant and well-advised.”“Imagine an EV that complied with all IRA eligibility requirements but is kicked out because of a negligible amount of a critical mineral or component coming from” a foreign entity of concern, he said.But the temporary reprieve angered Manchin, who had already threatened to back a lawsuit over Treasury’s rules for the rest of the credit.“The proposed Treasury rules on Foreign Entities of Concern are another example of the Biden administration clearly breaking the law to try to implement a bill that it could not pass,” Manchin said.Robbie Diamond, founder and CEO of the advocacy group SAFE, which had pushed for a strict interpretation of the provision, said in a statement that he is “concerned today’s guidance doesn’t go far enough to ensure these credits maximally boost U.S. and allied production.”Diamond pointed to China’s recent export restrictions on key critical minerals as attempts by Beijing to “weaponize their control of the market.”The U.S. mining industry had also pushed for a stringent interpretation. Conor Bernstein, vice president of communications for the National Mining Association, said Friday that the rule marks “an important step forward in beginning to address America’s China-specific problem.”But Bernstein added that building up U.S. supply chains will require the Biden administration to do more to boost domestic mining and processing.Friday’s rules are the most significant update to the EV tax credit since the department proposed guidance interpreting the rest of the credit in March. Those rules initially restricted eligibility to just 14 models, though that number has topped 20 in recent months, including popular models like the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 and the Chevy Bolt.The administration is also hoping that another upcoming change in the rules will supercharge the credit. Beginning in January, EV buyers can choose to claim the credit as an instant rebate or cash when they buy the vehicle, rather than having to wait until filing taxes for the year.But the IRA also stipulates that another domestic sourcing requirement for automakers will become more stringent starting in January. Automakers will need to produce even more of their battery components and critical minerals for eligible vehicles in the United States or its trade partners, potentially disqualifying additional vehicles from the credit.Tanya Snyder contributed to this report.",13860,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/01/biden-china-crackdown-ev-00129475,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/41cf9f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6400x4264+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fad%2F76%2F06a128be450abbbc983cd99f1c87%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1243225090,Climate and Environment,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain make align potentially incentive investment complicit begin back car alliance switch negligible key expect build biden told warn provision official argues lay transition praise purely significant restriction party agrees content recent patent safe popular advance plant contemporary mistake slow labor manufacturer ban march congress consider insist partner drew stringent detailed rest climate bipartisan fairly internal ensure base debbie albert tesla code park protect put factory exercise manufacturing buying sought cell entity exception extricate dollar group affordable navigate act lithium open stock seat reassess mineral largely iran loose revenue association qualify european material shave price director send trade law electric normal comprehensive share meet place tax pillar hybrid wally avenue foreign minefield policy planning voting iron angered democratic earlier japanese chip leave imagine topped allied language continue trace phosphate firm emblematic note deal receive executive shift establish america energy practice president power regulation strike chinese needle unlawful ford target export hawk arbitrary term away attack operate flow joint founder distinguish rule import concern subject reporter anonymously totally violation penalty free tech number wheel range set respectively amount bid technology slash opportunity appreciates resolution force implication china cash reverse licensing reduction pragmatic delay extremely soften threshold vehicle effective report mark marco korean maintain smith discourages change important wide walk adoption bernstein year fuel jason address general structure buyer real purchase require grant effect branch lock review completely national benefit large implement lawmaker mining mike korea rate definition boost impose short overturn requirement part similar automaker global beijing license floodgate instant proposal expand percent select balance russia department victory payment reprieve point exemption advanced ira offer specific communication express minimis month watcher temporarily author tie demand successor automotive step clamp board snyder manufacture guidance interpret initially agreement shameful country filing concerned left secretary quick notably administration chevy stabenow doe republican infrastructure currently cover worry clear stipulates safavian reliance statement transportation write communist congressional licensee difficult strict roll drive push taxpayer common sell naive offering enforce disqualify vice bound forward physically flexibility wait constraint administer restrict eligible produce chain possible foremost commerce define anytime week treaty control give comply component condemn flip add plan supplier enforces diversify welcome iii north motor break science relatively battery powder ire believe workarounds provide choose attempt mechanism treasury incentivizing propose house committee innovation presidential tall facility separate temporary buy industry maximally reduce source additional company agenda access joe applicant proposes building seek consumer manchin leeway find spare supercharge bill include model approach introduce measure emission period extensive representative confidence fee bar production upcoming kick interest escalate time weaponize rubio adeyemo thread subsidiary amperex hop chair bozzella subsidy series link thoughtfully fully conceivable diamond critical arrangement lawsuit applies credit fossil work january ambitious auto contribute instance severe deputy threaten carmaker michigan dominates primary john supply issue south gallagher call hard eligibility disappear senior today determine rebate drop inflation evaluate federal speak billion campaign ceo rely gore conor program venture contain zero position high stricter state ip domestic situation business aim origin adjust update task involve argue democrat workable interpretation american claim list olive leverage held represent advocacy dominance lever highlight hill friday moment united start ev cut,0.9888,0.0649350649350649,12.097020927369716,0.4091969474304802,0,2023-12-01
CNN,King Charles says world heading for ‘dangerous uncharted territory’ at global leaders summit,2023-12-01 07:29:00,Laura Paddison,"King Charles III told world leaders Friday that the warning signs of the climate crisis are being ignored and that the world is heading for “dangerous uncharted territory,” with devastating consequences for lives and livelihoods.Delivering an opening address to delegates at the World Climate Action Summit, part of the COP28 summit in Dubai, the King said he prayed “with all my heart that COP28 will be a critical turning point towards genuine transformational action.”“Some important progress has been made but it worries me greatly that we remain so dreadfully far off track,” he said, adding, “we are taking the natural world outside balanced norms and limits and into dangerous uncharted territory.”Referring to this year’s climate change-fueled extreme weather, including Canada’s unprecedented wildfire season, deadly flooding in Pakistan and Bangladesh and catastrophic drought in East Africa, the King told delegates that the “hope of the world” rested on decisions taken at the summit.“We are carrying out a vast, frightening experiment of changing every ecological condition all at once as a pace that far outstrips nature’s ability to cope,” he said.The King called for a series of measures, including a ramp-up of public and private finance, to tackle the climate crisis and rapidly increase renewable energy.“In 2050, our grandchildren won’t be asking what we said, they will be living with the consequences of what we did or didn’t do,” he said. “The Earth does not belong to us, we belong to the Earth,” he added.Friday marked the King’s first big speech on climate change since he became monarch last year. The King did not attend last year’s COP27 summit in Egypt, after the then UK Prime Minister, Liz Truss advised him against going. CNN understood at the time that, the monarch and government jointly agreed that the climate summit wasn’t the right occasion for the King’s first trip overseas as sovereign.UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who has already spoken at the ceremony, announced a $30 billion green investment fund, “designed to bridge the climate finance gap.”Developing nations have long pushed the rich world to channel more financing to the global south to help it make the green transition. He spoke in Dubai, where the UAE is hosting the talks.After a year of record global temperatures, fueling deadly extreme weather, the pressure is high at COP28 for leaders to make ambitious progress on tackling the climate crisis. But countries still remain divided about the role fossil fuels, the main driver of climate change, will play in the future.COP28, which opened Thursday, started with a significant development as countries formally adopted a damage fund, decades in the making, to help nations hit hardest by the climate crisis.Among countries making immediate commitments were the United Arab Emirates and Germany, both of which pledged $100 million, and the UK, which announced £60million, part of which will be used for “other arrangements,” according to the news release. The US announced a commitment of $17.5 million, which some experts and advocacy groups said was “embarrassing.”On Friday, leaders of 134 countries — which together produce 70% of the world’s food — including the US, the European Union and Brazil, signed a declaration pledging to include food in their climate change plans by 2025. It marks the first time a COP summit leaders’ declaration has focused on food and the climate crisis.Food systems are responsible for around a third of global planet-warming pollution. At the same time, agriculture is increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events, which climate change is making more frequent and more intense.Ani Dasgupta, CEO of the international climate nonprofit World Resources Institute, called the pledge a “big deal.” It sends “a powerful signal” that “we can only keep the 1.5 degree goal in sight if we act fast to shift the global food system,” he said in a statement.But others said that, while the pledge was welcome, it was too vague. It “doesn’t set out how governments will tackle food emissions,” Patty Fong, Program Director at the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, said in a statement.World leaders including India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazil’s President Lula Da Silva and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak are addressing delegates Friday at the talks in Dubai.CNN’s Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Angela Dewan and Ella Nilsen contributed reporting",4460,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/climate/king-charles-cop28-uae-investment-unsg-climate-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/local/231129103056-2023-cop-and-beyond-logo-large-169.png?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill",Climate and Environment,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain make reporting increase thursday arab speech investment renewable marked alliance country temperature told warn charles weather transition significant ecological agriculture catastrophic minister genuine monarch adopt pressure rapidly progress worry pace dangerous dewan announce finance news nation action pollution cope egypt damage overseas refer sheikh grandchild driver push norm rest climate emirate nature head spoke development sends canada group act heart open expert produce increasingly silva living vast european summit divide director design add plan zayed public sign extreme fong welcome iii understood brazil crisis attend narendra lula territory future flood develop consequence focus unprecedented formally condition dubai jointly king ability host degree million carry big shift uae institute pledge dreadfully earth president government fund devastate vague private prime event rishi nahyan uncharted powerful vulnerable transformational lauren rich include sight financing measure emission international patty prayed ceremony natural frighten nilsen limit time food set drought decade belong delegate series goal modi fast responsible advise cnn critical africa arrangement cop fossil accord commitment ambitious contribute mohammed bangladesh world track mark immediate east declaration tackle germany important change call south experiment opening year pakistan fuel signal long address channel occasion season spoken release record billion frequent hope uk ceo resource sunak wildfire agree program green high truss role bridge system nonprofit leader part global hit hardest balance greatly deadly liz point india dasgupta angela turn advocacy ignore play friday outstrips united start trip talk union decision life,0.548,0.9417040358744396,10.043087885985749,0.4844201228878648,0,2023-12-01
CNN,OPEC+ members agree to significant voluntary oil production cuts,2023-11-30 15:54:00,Anna Cooban,"Several OPEC+ countries agreed to voluntarily cut oil production by a total of 2.2 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2024, the oil producing group announced Thursday.Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, will lead the effort by extending a voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels per day of oil — previously intended to run till the end of December — by another three months, according to a statement from OPEC+, which comprises the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.The kingdom’s production will stay at around 9 million barrels a day until the end of March 2024, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing “an official source from the Ministry of Energy,” after Saudi officials met with other major oil-producing nations in Vienna Thursday.In addition to Saudi Arabia, the following voluntary barrel-per-day production cuts were announced: Russia by 500,000; Iraq by 223,000; the United Emirates by 163,000; Kuwait by 135,000; Kazakhstan by 82,000; Algeria by 51,000 and Oman by 42,000, OPEC+ said.The group also announced after the meeting that Brazil, another major oil producer, will join at the start of next year. It’s not yet clear if that means Brazil will have to commit to OPEC+ shared production quotas.Brazilian Minister of Mines and Energy Alexandre Silveira told OPEC+ members on Thursday he received President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s stamp of approval to join, pending a technical review of the charter for cooperation.Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, settled down 0.3% at $82.83 a barrel and 2.3% at $75.96 a barrel, respectively, after the Saudi report came out. The contracts traded at around $84 and $79 before the meeting.The ministerial meeting had originally been scheduled for Sunday, but last week OPEC+ postponed it until Thursday, without providing a reason.Some media reports, citing unnamed OPEC+ sources, said the delay was due to disagreements over the production levels of some members and possible cuts associated with them.Despite pledges by the group this year to slash output by 3.66 million barrels per day until the end of 2024 — and additional voluntary cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia — Brent and WTI prices have now fallen 13% and nearly 16%, respectively, since their peaks in late September.Prices have been pressured by record crude oil production in the United States and worries about waning global demand for the fuel, particularly in China, the world’s biggest oil importer.— Hanna Ziady contributed reporting.",2594,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/energy/saudi-arabia-extend-production-cut-opec/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,crude run month saudi receive silveira cut inacio lula nation press source contribute oil produce schedule brent possible arabia announce oman pressure demand united unnamed review december stamp barrel disagreement reporting kuwait country voluntary year respectively west level petroleum clear technical state fuel settle medium ministerial effort kazakhstan ministry originally sunday president worry export global pending million official hanna late statement pledge told benchmark wti kingdom quarter ziady output charter brazil agree due production postpone vienna minister intermediate wan algeria approval luiz start delay total big accord iraq provide world contract producer major addition stay agency lead share previously member report alexandre associate follow additional silva commit organization china russia week particularly voluntarily join energy group meeting emirate comprises thursday exporter march day extend price intend trade texas fall peak record slash,-0.2462,0.0,11.296765957446809,0.4156378600823045,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,"COP28 is off to a fast start, and a showdown on fossil fuels looms",2023-11-30 14:57:00,"Christian Shepherd, Chico Harlan","DUBAI — In a quick start to a summit that usually starts slow, nations at the U.N. Climate Change Conference on Thursday struck an agreement on an unprecedented fund aimed at helping vulnerable nations hit by climate emergencies.The decision, coming after years of contention, provided a much-needed, best-case example of how the summit, known as COP28, can work when facing a narrowing window to divert the planet from its disastrous path.“We have delivered history today,” said Sultan Al Jaber, the president of this year’s conference, known as COP28, adding that never before had countries adopted a decision on the first day.But for all the early momentum, there are doubts about whether the event — taking place during the hottest year on record — can carry on smoothly, particularly as countries confront even more divisive issues. One of those pertains to fossil fuels, with most scientific projections calling for a swift phase-down of the use of oil and gas. But this year’s COP’s president, who happens to be an oil CEO, kicked off ceremonies on Thursday by opening his arms to the oil and gas industries — some of the world’s primary polluters — saying that they can “lead the way” in the energy transition.Moments later, Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, told delegates that it was time to “signal the terminal decline of the fossil fuel era as we know it.”That back-and-forth reflected that this is a COP of profound contradictions — which conference attendees could see on the train ride from downtown Dubai to the sprawling conference center hosting the talks.The route passes dozens of shimmering skyscrapers, two golf courses kept green in the desert heat and a long row of giant oil-burning power plants against an azure ocean.Now the UAE is in the global spotlight, hosting an annual gathering that has ballooned into the largest U.N. event of the year — a grand and somewhat bewildering blend of science and activism, business and diplomacy, urgency and inertia.Some of that urgency played out behind the scenes in the weeks leading up to COP, as Al Jaber and other officials homed in on the idea of greenlighting what is known as the “loss and damage” fund on the opening day as a momentum-building move and tried to rally support among regional groups.One person familiar with those discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks, said that past COP presidents might have preferred to let countries openly deliberate a fund with a design that has potential shortcomings. But Al Jaber’s approach, that person said, was “I’ll gavel and let people moan a bit” after the fact.“So it’s like, ‘I am in charge, stop messing around, bring me a solution’ — clearly setting the tone,” the person said.Although the idea of a fund was approved last year at COP27 in Egypt, that agreement came without any specifics about how it would work and who would pay for it. Those details were left to a committee that met periodically during the past year to hash out some of the details in sessions that turned testy. The group nonetheless managed to deliver a proposal that was voted on Thursday.“Hearing no objections, it is so decided,” Al Jaber said, as delegates rose and applauded.The fund approved Thursday will initially be held at the World Bank — an idea that developing countries accepted reluctantly, because they see that organization as issuing loans rather than disbursing grants, and as overly influenced by wealthy nations including the United States. Developed countries are urged, rather than obliged, to contribute to the fund, and there is no target for its size; adopting such language proved too controversial.Immediately after the agreement Thursday, some countries made initial pledges, including $245 million from the European Union and its members — $100 million of that coming from Germany — and an additional $100 million from the United Arab Emirates. The UAE’s pledge could put pressure on other oil-rich states to follow suit. The United States’ special climate envoy, John F. Kerry, said the nation would “work with our Congress” and pledge $17.5 million.Other pledges could come later during the climate talks, with world leaders convening Friday and Saturday.It will take longer to assess whether the fund can become meaningfully large, as those first pledges are expected to be far less than the annual cost of climate-related damage in developing countries. One commonly cited study estimates that annual climate-related loss and damage will range between $290 billion and $580 billion by 2030.Initial pledges would be more like “good-faith money, signaling that countries are ready to come to the table,” said Preety Bhandari, a senior adviser at the Washington-based World Resources Institute. “One has to look at it in the broader perspective. The billions we are talking about, let’s see.”After world leaders convene for two days, negotiations begin in earnest — a period likely to bring to the surface tensions about fossil fuels. Al Jaber has portrayed the UAE as a regional leader of the energy transition that is using its wealth for green projects domestically and abroad. But the host country is also expanding its oil capacity and investing some $150 billion in its operations, a move that scientists say works against the world’s goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Dubai’s Expo City, which opened in 2021 to host a world expo delayed by the pandemic, is dotted with dozens of pavilions where countries and businesses alike seek to burnish their green credentials, including a company touting emissions-free hydrogen-powered superyachts.Golf carts carrying dignitaries slowly nudged through crowds of lobbyists, activists and journalists as they hurried between meeting rooms air-conditioned against the 80-plus-degree midday heat.Among the activist crowd, there are ongoing questions about whether this COP is more about gimmicks than substance.Attendees this year can try out the air in domed pollution pods or admire a racecar made of recycled iPhones and computer motherboards. But can they be certain that their attendance is making a difference?That contradiction doesn’t appear to have been lost on the organizers. “Yes, this is the biggest COP yet,” Stiell said at the opening ceremonies, “but attending a COP does not tick the climate box for the year.”“Science tells us we have around six years before we exhaust the planet’s ability to cope with our emissions,” he added.",6529,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/11/30/climate-summit-cop28-financing/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,leader narrow tick company host azure grand slowly pass earnest disastrous pollution profound ceo nation oblige contribute project golf wealthy computer pandemic union loss bit surface united disburse convene swift motherboards ongoing rally center rise make hurry portrayed shortcoming year difference dignitary fuel green developed hash industry broader desert science john agreement scientist turn resource initially include tone projection million power change expand influence history pledge spoke recycle hit familiar momentum urge detail sprawl time domestically goal adopt fossil home today hottest course estimate operation spotlight crowd describe stiell train gavel start long decide big vulnerable reflect provide divisive proposal call executive city institute move invest preety bhandari tension ass hearing ability lose additional lobbyist quick admire convention past exhaust organization kick periodically aim uae bewildering decision planet attendance dozen attendee particularly issue signal blend slow approach set event energy gas prefer meeting idea meaningfully activist thursday delegate pay talk heat framework congress moan emission approve unprecedented size shimmer question open scene initial session degree record opening primary abroad specific anonymity table cop bring conference money ready longer perspective european secretary billion left diplomacy expect pavilion arm divert contradiction egypt greenlighting oil negotiation played seek cart pressure smoothly polluter gathering scientific cost stop limit credential racecar wealth gimmick balloon grant midday attend country solution burnish summit adviser range transition contention state deliberate private large place target downtown president begin global person discussion warm early organizer work potential activism add jaber official bank design kerry loan accepted period told envoy nonetheless overly damage tout friday vote annual carry confront box dot put business testy charge row skyscraper committee climate room doubt expo plant regional capacity world terminal language lead journalist special decline cope giant member delayed iphones follow germany pertains alike dubai struck develop arab senior domed commonly ceremony week held nudge deliver mess sultan route simon openly group air reluctantly emirate suit prove ride urgency day objection study condition support manage window fund,0.90685,0.2756930617246133,10.420745650372822,0.4456926406926406,0,2023-11-30
CNN,"Nations pledge millions to new climate damage fund at COP28, US criticized for its small contribution",2023-11-30 11:35:00,Angela Dewan,"Global delegates at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai formally adopted a damage fund that was decades in the making, and several countries pledged millions of dollars to it to help nations hit hardest by the climate crisis – an early success on the first day of talks that allows more time to discuss the thorny issues around slashing fossil fuels.But the United States is receiving criticism for contributing an “embarrassing” amount of money to the fund, less than a fifth of the United Arab Emirates’ contribution and 14 times less than the European Union’s.Demand for a fund to channel money to developing countries to help them cope with the impacts of climate change has for years stymied progress at the annual negotiations. The details of the fund were agreed to earlier this month at a pre-COP meeting and were formalized Thursday, in the hope it would allow for progress in other areas at the summit.“We have delivered history today — the first time a decision has been adopted on day 1 of any COP,” COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber said. The motion passed without objection and was met with a standing ovation.While all parties agreed to the fund, there was previously opposition to allowing the World Bank to host it. Several countries objected to the bank managing the money on the basis that it has strong US connections. All parties ultimately agreed on the condition that the World Bank’s oversight of the fund would be temporary.Some countries pledged money to the fund right after it was agreed. The COP28 host country, the United Arab Emirates, pledged $100 million, as did Germany. The UK announced £60million, part of which will be used for “other arrangements,” according to the release, while the US committed $17.5 million to the fund and Japan contributed $10 million.While climate experts and advocacy groups largely praised the establishment of the fund, they also say it was just a first step on a long road to ensuring the countries hit hardest by the climate crisis are fully supported.Money from rich nations must now begin flowing into the fund, they said.“The loss and damage fund will be a lifeline to people in their darkest hour, enabling families to rebuild their homes after disaster strikes, support farmers when their crops are wiped out and relocate those that become permanently displaced by rising seas,” said Ani Dasgupta, president & CEO of World Resources Institute. “This outcome was hard-fought but is a clear step forward.”The US in particular was criticized for its $17.5-million contribution, which some experts and advocacy groups said was “embarrassing” and “striking” for how small it is compared to the pledges of other nations.Dasgupta called the contribution from the US, and Japan’s of $10 million, “disappointing.”“Given the size of their economies, there is simply no excuse for their contributions to be far eclipsed by others,” Dasgupta said.Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, panned the US contribution as far too small. “The initial funding pledges are clearly inadequate and will be a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of the need they are to address,” Adow said in a statement. “In particular, the amount announced by the US is embarrassing for President Biden and (US climate envoy) John Kerry. It just shows how this must be just the start.”Tom Evans, a policy adviser at international climate think tank E3G, noted the US delegation to COP is under considerable political pressure from dynamics at home, with a Republican-controlled US House of Representatives.Still, he said, the size of the US contribution was “striking” compared to the far larger amounts from the UAE and Germany.US officials were clear they were donating to a “climate impacts fund,” Evans said, adding, “they’re seeking to avoid the funds being called loss and damage because of fears about how that would be received by Republicans in Congress.”Evans noted the US contribution is subject to approval from Congress, adding “we have seen in the past how difficult that is for the United States.”CNN has reached out to the US delegation at COP28 for a response.The development comes after years of wrangling over who should pay for climate impacts. Developing countries and small island states have been pressing for these types of funds since the early 1990s.Several wealthy nations, including the United States, have been reluctant to tie countries’ obligations to their historic emissions. It’s also been contentious because wealthy nations have expressed concern that paying for such a fund could be seen as admission of climate liability.With the damage fund decision out of the way, focus will now be on the Global Stocktake, where countries will need to agree on language to formally note what the world has achieved so far in responding to the climate crisis.But the most controversial issue is the language that will define the future of fossil fuel use.Since last year’s summit in Egypt, more than 80 countries have voiced support for language around phasing out fossil fuels, though many wish to continue using them as long as the climate pollution is captured before it enters the atmosphere. Several analysts have told CNN the UAE is pushing for allowances on carbon capture in the final text.The UAE has been fiercely criticized for appointing Al Jaber — who also runs the nation’s mammoth oil and gas company, ADNOC — to preside over the meetings. More than 100 members of US Congress and the European Parliament voiced opposition to his appointment in May, while many NGOs have questioned whether he, and the UAE more broadly, can run a transparent conference free from its own energy interests.Al Jaber pledged in his opening remarks that he would ensure full transparency in the process.",5761,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/climate/loss-damage-fund-adopted-cop28/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,appoint run express company international outcome strike host pass mammoth permanently pollution ceo nation press contribute type eclipse wealthy union loss channel announce displace farmer united final disaster make rise year opposition africa clear fuel fear allowance adnoc john part island resource advocacy analyst include small wish economy political million power change ultimately expert development preside history pledge statement motion hit atmosphere transparent detail hour time adopt delegation fossil road focus home today cnn long accord japan continue family define enters ensure ocean parliament darkest call oversight fully address institute relocate previously release simply considerable impact discus establishment embarrass tie past uae decision issue energy gas drop object stymie meeting shift rebuild thursday delegate pay talk congress crisis emission thorny size achieve contentious question formally note donate full initial opening slash free cop conference money month evans european receive scale subject formalize tank egypt oil negotiation seek difficult pressure republican wipe reluctant rich excuse contribution controversial future party obligation connection hardest policy country summit funding adviser state fiercely large broadly biden president begin voiced global ani strong dasgupta early step add jaber official house bank kerry director told dynamic envoy damage crop annual largely agree give remark flow approval phase reach climate stocktake praise criticism world wrangle amount language arrangement show cope transparency admission member tom germany pan decade ngo inadequate basis commit criticize dubai develop respond success arab avoid progress earlier adow deliver sultan concern uk enable compare group particular appointment capture hope historic emirate area process day objection condition lifeline support manage carbon stand dollar push fund,0.84755,0.2603714632876237,10.25840972871843,0.4425255102040816,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,Extreme weather helped fuel surge in malaria cases last year,2023-11-30 09:00:00,"Kevin Crowe, Brady Dennis","The number of malaria cases worldwide surged by millions last year, the World Health Organization said Thursday — a change driven by extreme weather events such as catastrophic flooding in Pakistan, as well as other conflicts and humanitarian crises that allowed the deadly disease to proliferate.The WHO said the spike came after a two-decade stretch beginning in 2000 that saw global cases of malaria fall from 243 million to 233 million, despite population booms in many parts of the developing world.But in recent years, the agency said, the global case count “was significantly higher than before the pandemic.” There were an additional 11 million recorded cases in 2020, followed by no change in 2021, then an increase of 5 million cases in 2022, the most recent year for which data are available — resulting in about 249 million cases worldwide.“Malaria is not a disease where you can keep a steady path. You’re either winning against it, or you’re losing,” said Peter Sands, the Executive Director of The Global Fund. “At the moment we’re at a crux where we’re certainly not winning as much as we would like to be.”According to the WHO, the wave of additional cases logged between 2021 and 2022 were concentrated largely across five countries.Pakistan, where hundreds of people died and millions were displaced by unprecedented flooding, saw the largest rise in malaria, with 2.1 million cases during that time. The case incidence jumped fivefold there, health officials said, from 2.2 to 11.5 cases per 1,000 people at risk in the country. Ethiopia and Nigeria each saw an increase of about 1.3 million cases over the same time period, followed by Uganda and Papua New Guinea.Malaria deaths worldwide decreased to 608,000 in 2022 from a recent high of 631,000 in 2020, but they still hovered above pre-pandemic totals. Most malaria deaths are in children under the age of 5.“What we and our partner countries see every day, right now, are concrete changes that are affecting our work programmatically and putting more people at risk,” David Walton, the U.S. global malaria coordinator at the U.S. Agency for International Development, said in a statement.“It is a painful reality that the communities least responsible for climate change are the ones most vulnerable to its impacts,” he said.Thursday’s report makes clear that many factors can shape the rise or fall of malaria, a potentially fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito that feeds on humans. They include political unrest and conflict, humanitarian crises, lack of funding and resistance to front-line medications. The lingering impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and the interruptions it caused in health care access also played a role.But, the WHO underscored, Earth’s warming climate is likely to have profound effects, both directly and indirectly, on malaria transmission.While data on the long-term impact of climate change on the spread of malaria is “sparse,” the agency said, there is reason to believe that a hotter world will only fuel the spread of such diseases.Scientists have detailed how extreme weather disasters are becoming more intense and common. In Pakistan during 2022, for instance, warming caused glaciers to melt and rivers to surge in the north of the country. Heating of the Indian Ocean contributed to torrential rainfall in the south.Extreme floods drive people from their homes, exposing them to the elements and mosquitoes. The standing water left behind creates an ideal mosquito breeding ground for months. The water also damages health care facilities and cuts off transportation, leaving sick people without means of treatment.“The places that are most affected are the places that have the least infrastructure to respond to these sorts of events,” said Ross Boyce, an assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. “I do think it’s going to become an increasing contributor to global malaria burden.”Extreme weather events are merely one example of the type of challenges that could lie ahead.“Climate change threatens the complex relationship between natural and human systems and undermines many of the social determinants of good health — such as livelihoods, nutrition, security and access to quality health services,” Thursday’s WHO report states. “It is a both singular threat to health and a ‘threat multiplier.’”A recent Washington Post analysis found that climate change and demographic growth could put more than 5 billion people at risk for malaria by 2040, imperiling decades of global progress against the disease.The threat posed by malaria stands to soar as the planet warms because of longer transmission seasons, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, and the migration of malaria-carrying mosquitoes to new latitudes and altitudes, according to a Post analysis of climate modeling data and reporting from the southern African country of Mozambique.Health data obtained and analyzed by The Post detailed how dire the situation is becoming in particularly vulnerable places. In Mozambique, cases are on pace this year to reach their highest level since 2017, when the government began its current process for counting cases.The Post analysis details which countries and regions face the most acute risk, in particular as seasonal changes benefit disease-carrying mosquitoes. In some regions of the world, transmission seasons could increase by up to five months by 2070.“Efforts to fight malaria are at this crossroads and have been seriously challenged by climate change,” Sherwin Charles, the co-founder of Goodbye Malaria, which has been working to end malaria in southern Africa, told The Post this year. “We thought we knew how to deal with this epidemic, but the complication of climate change brings different factors to bear that maybe we are not ready for.”In the United States, warming temperatures and increased rainfall are projected to lengthen malaria transmission seasons across the South. In June, five locally transmitted cases were discovered in Texas and Florida; they were the first cases acquired in the United States in two decades. Once endemic, malaria was eliminated in North America and Europe in the mid-1900s as officials gained a better understanding of how to control it.The disease has remained widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, but did experience notable declines in incidence and mortality rates in the 2000s following a multibillion-dollar health campaign led by Western governments and international nonprofits. Those efforts prompted the widespread use of insecticide-treated bed nets, quick tests and more readily available treatments.Some of the gains in Africa have been reversed since 2017, and experts say this trend is likely to continue, although advances such as improvements to the malaria vaccine could brighten the outlook in years ahead. Researchers and government officials attribute some of the ongoing challenges not simply to climate change, but also to the increased resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides and of the parasite to drugs. Improved disease surveillance and data collection could also be contributing to higher case counts.While scientists continue trying to better understand how climate affects malaria transmission, they know that the parasites and the mosquitoes that transport them tend to thrive in warm, humid and rainy conditions. The insects do best when temperatures are around 80 degrees Fahrenheit.And in a steadily warming world, more places are becoming suitable for the disease and the vector that spreads it.",7630,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/11/30/malaria-mosquitoes-climate-change-flooding/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,insecticide mosquito partner potentially malaria lack readily programmatically international linger improve profound america effect resistance leave threat post spread region contribute project data type social growth moment pandemic heating humid south displace glacier uganda infects outlook crux health united disaster singular ongoing rise florida make painful coordinator deadly epidemic year concentrate level africa clear fuel papua deal result directly element researcher rainfall assistant instance analysis latitude scientist part unrest include earth tend dire extreme path conflict expose ground political water severe north million underscored rate change expert government development acquire affected europe prompt nonprofit shape western affect detail remain reason time decrease count home system pakistan drive imperil transportation catastrophic natural discover acute coronavirus vulnerable accord continue responsible security ocean community executive agency melt simply reverse report impact steadily sparse lose current additional mozambique determinant available goodbye quick suitable organization service knew facility southern bed surveillance eliminate river torrential nutrition livelihood planet particularly carolina event ideal insect frequent thursday counting detailed steady indirectly found thrive crisis concrete transmit unprecedented complex collection challenge texas fall degree record number university ready month longer vaccine population win seasonal charles billion left cut sand altitude high driven undermines played feed spike warms boom migration believe ahead obtain reporting pace country mortality funding endemic school state indian large model effort place campaign sherwin fatal begin understand stretch global sort warm african washington relationship season age work june infrastructure official challenged ross temperature complication wave brings director period told contributor attribute hover boyce damage demographic walton pose incidence fivefold largely despite lengthen medicine put death child experience humanitarian trend flood factor reach ethiopia crossroad worldwide risk climate sick jumped intense total nigeria test surge improvement world creates brighten lead decline reality locally transport common net different access professor benefit follow transmission decade hotter rainy develop weather quality respond case significantly progress control commonly disease bear breeding threatens advance analyze particular vector lie david recent process fight soar increase epidemiology widespread human day condition hundred parasite interruption situation notable stand medication fund,0.0366999999999999,0.1572739187418086,12.05057677902622,0.4720638820638821,0,2023-11-30
New York Times,Wolverines Get Protection in the Lower 48 States,2023-11-29 08:45:00,Catrin Einhorn,"Wolverines in the contiguous United States are threatened by climate change and habitat fragmentation and will be listed under the Endangered Species Act, the federal government announced Wednesday.The largest terrestrial member of the weasel family, wolverines are famously fierce for their size.

CNN,"Are the annual climate summits working? These countries are going to the courts, instead",2023-11-29 03:00:00,Ella Nilsen,"Few leaders paint a picture of the climate crisis as vividly as United Nations chief António Guterres. He has accused world leaders of opening “the gates of hell” and said the planet is “heading into uncharted territories of destruction” after deadly heat waves and floods.“The current fossil fuel free-for-all must end now,” Guterres said last year. “It is a recipe for permanent climate chaos and suffering.”Yet the UN climate summit, known as COP, is tedious. It is full of jargon, snail-paced developments and painful consensus-building that can be broken by a single country’s veto.Now some are asking: Is the process even working? Some small island nations — countries that are facing irrevocable change from rising seas — say no.Over the decades, these painstaking negotiations have worked to prevent several catastrophic degrees of global warming. COP’s biggest win was the Paris Agreement, widely seen as one of the most effective environment treaties, which set a goal to limit global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5 — a target that climate scientists, advocates and most countries have since rallied around.Before those talks, the world was on track for roughly 4 degrees of warming. Countries’ pledges after Paris pushed that to 2.5 to 2.9 degrees, according to recent UN figures.But the Paris Agreement was voluntary by design, in large part due to the influence of the US, and it relies on a system of collective shaming and competitive ambition in lieu of legal consequences. It contained “very few obligations” for major polluters, said Payam Akhavan, an attorney for the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law.Vanuatu, Tuvalu and Antigua and Barbuda are now asking international courts to issue “advisory opinions” that could fundamentally change future COPs by compelling countries to set legally binding targets to cut climate pollution, rather than voluntary ones.“The turn toward international litigation is an attempt to put some teeth in the toothless Paris regime, by declaring the 1.5-degree target is a binding target and not discretionary,” Akhavan told CNN.As world leaders head to Dubai for COP28 this week, this courtroom strategy is raising eyebrows among the United States’ current and former climate negotiators, who say that while diplomacy can be stubborn and slow, it yields progress.Even fierce climate advocates who agree COP should be more ambitious still believe the summit is a powerful and worthwhile endeavor.“There is a lot of questioning whether this process will deliver or not,” Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of international climate nonprofit World Resources Institute, told CNN. “However, I believe COP, or some version of COP, will remain and absolutely is needed. This is the only forum that I know where poor countries actually have a place at the table that is equal, to negotiate with rich countries across a vastly important topic.”COP’s detractors and advocates alike agree it is a crucial annual meeting, but also one that is plodding and technical. An errant word or piece of punctuation can derail negotiations, and it can — and often does — take years for incremental progress to happen.“I would say it’s necessary, but maybe not sufficient,” said Sue Biniaz, the deputy for US climate envoy and former Secretary of State John Kerry.Biniaz has a lot of experience at COPs; she was the United States’ lead climate lawyer for more than two decades and was one of the key authors of the Paris Agreement.Both Biniaz and other former top US climate negotiators told CNN that although each climate summit is often judged as a singular event, it is more important to look at the year leading up to it.“It’s necessary because the fact that it meets annually and puts pressure on countries is a good thing, and we’re in a lot better position with the annual COPs and the Paris Agreement than we would have been without it,” Biniaz told CNN. “At the same time, it is really difficult and challenging to get agreement among everyone in the world, particularly when you have geopolitical issues, and some countries may be more motivated to reach agreement than others.”International politics and the dynamics within countries matter to the success or failure of COP. There is no better recent example of than the shockwave that surged through the summit when former President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris agreement in 2017 — a move President Joe Biden reversed upon taking office.Still, former and current US negotiators say climate diplomacy has helped keep the world’s temperature from reaching truly alarming highs.“If you look at those first assessments coming out of the scientific community back then, we were looking at an incremental temperature gain of about 7 degrees,” said Jonathan Pershing, a former Kerry deputy who now directs the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation’s environment program. “Seven degrees, today, is unimaginable.”Pershing added that the fact the world’s governments are now racing to keep to below 2 degrees of warming is an “extraordinary transition.”“The collective endeavor has fundamentally altered the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions,” Pershing said. “I think countries move farther when they move together.”The annual summit has also become the most visible rallying point for global climate action, former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. The summits used to largely be a gathering of only government climate negotiators, but each year COP becomes much larger — drawing advocates, businesses (including fossil fuel companies) and think tanks from all corners of the globe.Stern thinks the growing spectacle of COP is a positive force, impossible to ignore even for groups that used to deny climate change’s existence. Even US House Republicans have sent a delegation for the past two years.“It’s a two-week moment in the course of the year when people around the world — or at least some meaningful subset of people around the world — are paying attention to it,” Stern said. “That needs to keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger because that puts pressure on governments.”Attorneys for the small island nations who are rocking the boat at COP say the proof it isn’t working is in the extreme heat felt around the world this year, and the global records smashed.The world’s governments are working to hold global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius — above which scientists say a hotter world with more severe droughts and intense storms will become difficult to adapt to.But 1.5 degrees is no longer an abstract concept; the world briefly crossed that temperature threshold this summer, though scientists caution it will take several years above that limit to say with confidence it’s been officially exceeded. This summer was a taste of life at this threshold: Wildfires raged across Europe, mighty rivers like the Mississippi and the Amazon fell to new lows, and hot-tub-like ocean water killed coral reefs and rapidly intensified hurricanes and cyclones.“It’s not as if 1.5 is safe in any way, but we are very much on track to cross it,” said Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, an international lawyer representing the island nation Vanuatu in climate litigation at the International Court of Justice. “Clearly we need more mitigation ambition to make sure we don’t end up with an unlivable world.”The potential for an unlivable world weighs heavily on young COP negotiators, who are urging swift action to cut climate pollution.Hailey Campbell, a 25-year-old, Hawaii-based climate adaptation specialist who successfully lobbied for more official youth representation at COP, told CNN it is sometimes disconcerting to spend long hours and days at international summits debating the precise words on climate finance and ramping down fossil fuel use, then return to her Honolulu home and see climate impacts first-hand.“You go back home and you’re like, ‘sea level rise is still here, [we] still need to do something about it,’” said Campbell, the co-executive director of advocacy group Care About Climate. “If I had to pick just one thing to come out of this year’s COP, it would be language to commit to an equitable phase-out of all fossil fuels.”Two of the world’s highest courts are expected to weigh in on the small island nations’ cases as soon as next year. While the advisory opinions alone can’t force faster action from countries, it can “inject some urgency, some political will, some vision” into the annual climate talks and protect the “inalienable rights” — the very survival — of these disappearing nations, Wewerinke-Singh said.“I think that the COP process has failed,” Akhavan said. “But we must make it work because we have no other choice.”",8748,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/climate/does-cop-work-un-summit-litigation/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point directs leader company international pollution ceo nation stern draw specialist swift ignore politics rally important deadly tedious officially back commission visible akhavan mighty attorney john precise turn rapidly represent advocacy relies intensified extreme ramp pershing trajectory change ambitious government justice influence pledge nonprofit ambition remain hour inject time goal disappear treaty delegation eyebrow youth equitable cnn catastrophic irrevocable hell alarm long big court ocean declare community shockwave motivate move wildfire author reverse meet punctuation amazon donald forum summer derail weigh single particularly issue honolulu existence event faster tuvalu representation painstaking pay hurricane heat emission question preferably challenge degree opening record vision yield survival table chaos cop longer rag secretary expect tank inalienable republican rich believe biniaz incremental celsius large target antónio biden ani lieu concept protect raise dasgupta errant potential official house design temperature director told jargon margaretha envoy binding disconcert discretionary annual largely business spend experience meaningful attention flora former briefly destruction caution recipe fail intense storm lawyer successfully poor positive litigation head absolutely return adapt negotiate decade kill plod alike commit success progress deliver territory courtroom prevent broken group chief position reef barbuda subset urgency uncharted top push strategy version environment widely program endeavor opinion adaptation cross moment race united singular worthwhile rise make painful spectacle year level fuel technical equal matter todd geopolitical agreement william scientist part island resource antigua include small alter heavily political assessment severe drought water stubborn development paint effective europe collective choice picture failure deputy vastly urge pull lobby fossil due home system fierce today course crucial rock exceed impossible mitigation accord proof deny institute coral threshold finance impact current past sham river planet negotiator extraordinary slow vanuatu set gas meeting compelling fell safe talk crisis accuse advisory action competitive mississippi full farther paris win diplomacy cut high negotiation difficult pressure attempt polluter gathering scientific limit track joe future contain obligation confidence jonathan country voluntary summit force state debate place piece fundamentally advocate president global warm legally annually boat work corner detractor life add kerry powerful consequence wave dynamic felt hold roughly agree young put trump reach foundation judged climate teeth surge word world major language low lead abstract regime campbell greenhouse sufficient taste pick lot hotter dubai guterres case vividly weighs grow week legal hewlett toothless unlivable recent key fact process day gate permanent payam,0.6575,0.3086419753086419,10.192974296205628,0.4118691643323997,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,A plane fueled by fat and sugar has crossed the Atlantic Ocean,2023-11-28 17:50:00,Nicolás Rivero,"For the first time ever, a commercial plane flew across the Atlantic Ocean without using fossil fuels.Virgin Atlantic said the test flight Tuesday from London to New York was powered only by sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, a broad category of jet fuel that creates fewer carbon emissions than standard kerosene blends. The fuel on this flight was made from waste fats and plant sugars and emits 70% less carbon than petroleum-based jet fuel, according to a press release. It landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday afternoon.Experts say sustainable aviation fuels may one day play a big role in shrinking the aviation industry’s carbon footprint — even though its production is minuscule today. SAF accounts for about 0.1% of airlines’ current fuel consumption.“SAF is a major aspect of the transition for aviation [to zero carbon emissions], and it’s especially critical this decade,” said Andrew Chen, principal for aviation decarbonization at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a clean-energy think tank. “But today, our big issue is we don’t make enough SAF.”Virgin Atlantic’s 100% SAF flight is a one-time stunt, and the airline won’t regularly offer all-SAF flights. Standard jet engines aren’t designed to run on only sustainable fuel, and it is too expensive and rare for it to be practical for airlines to run all-SAF routes.Still, Chen says it’s a milestone. “It’s a really important flight to highlight the progress that’s being made, the need for more SAF and the critical role they can play in decarbonizing aviation,” he said.Sustainable aviation fuels are a broad category that includes biofuels made from raw materials such as corn, animal fat, algae, municipal trash and sewage. By definition, they must emit at least 50% less carbon than petroleum-based jet fuel, according to federal guidelines.But all of these fuels still produce some emissions. SAF, on its own, will not get the airline industry to zero carbon emissions.To do that, the industry will have to develop new technologies that will allow planes to run on electric batteries, liquid hydrogen or some other as-yet-unproven fuel source. But it will take years of research to fully develop these technologies, and decades more for airlines to fully replace their existing fleets with planes that can run on new fuels, according to Chen.In the meantime, existing planes will keep running on liquid fuel. “There’s no getting around having to burn a fuel, so SAF is our way to displace fossil fuels” and reduce planes’ carbon emissions now, Chen said.The main advantage of SAF is that they are “drop-in” fuels, meaning they can have an impact right away because they can be blended with standard jet fuel and poured into engines.But there’s a limit on how much sustainable fuel a standard jet engine can take, according to Chen. Petroleum-based jet fuel contains aromatic compounds that keep jet engines running properly. Many versions of SAF don’t have these compounds.To operate the flight powered only by SAF, Virgin Atlantic mixed a fat-based biofuel with a bit of plant-based “synthetic aromatic kerosene,” a form of sustainable aviation fuel made from plant sugars that has the aromatic compounds needed to keep a jet engine running smoothly.The absence of aromatics is an obstacle for a 100% SAF flight, but Chen calls that a “champagne problem.” First, he said, the industry has to figure out how to ramp up sustainable fuel production so that it makes up more than 0.1% of jet fuel.“I would love it if we were talking about the fact that we’re bumping up against blending limits,” he said. “But we’re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do.”The SAF market is small and growing slowly. Chen says it suffers from a chicken-and-egg problem: Airlines don’t want to buy SAF because it can be several times more expensive than standard aviation fuel. And fuel refiners don’t want to invest in new manufacturing facilities — which could bring down the cost of sustainable fuels — because there isn’t enough demand from airlines.Governments and industry groups are trying to break that impasse and jump-start the growth of the SAF market.In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits to airlines that buy SAF, while the European Union has passed laws requiring airlines to use them. In Europe, airlines must use 70% SAF by 2050.Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum has led an industry push to create carbon credits based on SAF sales. Through an elaborate accounting framework, airlines can calculate how many carbon emissions they’re avoiding through their use of sustainable fuels and sell those credits to companies or passengers who want to offset the emissions they generate by flying.",4717,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/11/28/virgin-atlantic-sustainable-flight-lands-saf/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,run version international company slowly pass shrink impasse kerosene passenger press source growth regularly technology advantage union bit emit displace demand united manufacturing role emits make airline engine burn important year milestone expensive fuel virgin act industry calculate john buy atlantic include small champagne fleet reduce electric accounting ramp power credit bumping waste europe offset sewage kennedy form compound time economic fossil especially london contains today tax trash obstacle plane sustainable battery rare highlight synthetic accord big biofuels ocean reduction fully call institute release invest love impact flew sell jet current forum definition facility land issue blend municipal refiner aromatic talk framework emission suffers biofuel market flight break bring broad category european mixed tank stunt fly produce decarbonize limit cost decarbonization replace fat away airport mountain inflation transition state require york offer work footprint base operate design figure andrew standard research generate commercial production elaborate rocky blending exist hydrogen zero liquid saf test plant aviation world creates major absence sugar lead account meaning law chen meantime aspect practical algae play decade lot tuesday develop problem minuscule avoid critical grow progress corn aromatics principal group fact raw animal federal day create properly carbon material push,0.92345,0.0,9.334250832408436,0.4027429977429976,0,2023-11-28
CNN,"Climate summit host UAE planned to use the event to make oil deals, leaked notes suggest",2023-11-28 09:11:00,Angela Dewan,"The United Arab Emirates’ team organizing the COP28 climate talks that begin this week was planning to use its position as host of the summit to strike new oil and gas deals with foreign governments, a cache of leaked documents shows.The documents, which were published by the UK-registered Centre for Climate Reporting, appear to be briefing notes for Sultan Al Jaber — who will preside over the UN climate negotiations — for meetings with foreign officials in the run-up to the summit. They are organized as country profiles, with each document describing talking points for Al Jaber to raise in the meetings.The documents detail each country’s climate progress in key areas — including finance, decarbonizing food systems, uptake of renewables — and identify how their ambitions could be raised.But among those points are also several suggestions to offer new oil and gas projects with the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), which Al Jaber leads.ADNOC did not reply to CNN’s request for comment, but the company previously told CNN that any suggestion it was using the climate talks to promote itself “is incorrect and is baseless.”The documents were first shared with the BBC.A COP28 team spokesperson told CNN in an email: “The documents referred to in the BBC article are inaccurate and were not used by COP28 in meetings. It is extremely disappointing to see the BBC use unverified documents in their reporting.”The spokesperson did not address CNN’s question as to whether the COP28 team was operating independently of ADNOC, nor did they explicitly deny that business interests were discussed.The UAE has already been at the center of widespread criticism for appointing its top oil and gas chief to preside over COP28. As Al Jaber helms the summit, ADNOC is planning to expand its oil and gas production, according to an analysis from a fossil fuel watchdog, CNN has previously reported. The wider ADNOC Group is expanding abroad in a number of other areas as well, including petrochemicals and renewables.In addition to documents’ talking points around climate issues and promoting ADNOC are other suggestions to promote projects with the UAE’s main renewables vehicle, Masdar, which Al Jaber also runs.It’s not clear how many of the meetings actually took place, but the notes offer an insight into how the team hoped to use them as a vehicle for new deals. CNN has reached out to the 15 countries mentioned, three of which confirmed meetings, but said either no business discussions took place or would not confirm if they did. Another two replied to say no meeting occurred.The US, China, France, Germany and the UK are among the countries with briefing notes published by the Centre for Climate Reporting. The organization said there were 27 country profiles in all, but that it had decided to share 15.The Conference of the Parties (COP) host country, which changes every year, typically sends its nominated president-designate to meet with foreign officials to try and ramp up climate action ahead of the talks. The briefing notes read as would be expected for such meetings, until the end of each country’s notes, where suggestions to promote ADNOC and Masdar are included.UN rules say these meetings should not be used to promote the economic interests of the host country. According to the UN’s climate body, the UNFCCC, an elected or appointed COP official should remain “impartial” throughout the process. They are expected to act “without bias, prejudice, favoritism, caprice, self-interest, preference or deference” in the process, according to the body’s code of ethics. “They are also expected to ensure that personal views and convictions do not compromise or appear to compromise their role and functions as UNFCCC Officer.”Among the talking points outlined in the leaked briefing notes was that ADNOC was ready to “expand” its provision liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Germany. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a significant contributor to climate change. The leaked notes said ADNOC has already provided some LNG to the country in February 2023 to help it wean of Russian gas, part of Germany’s new strategy since Russia launched its war on Ukraine.ADNOC has the ambition to supply up to 25% of Germany’s hydrogen import demand, the notes say. Hydrogen can be made from natural gas, which the UAE has large reserves of.A spokesperson for Germany’s Federal Foreign Office confirmed the country’s international climate envoy, Jennifer Morgan, was “naturally in close contact with the COP28 presidency,” but did not comment when asked twice whether the two discussed LNG, or any potential business with ADNOC or Masdar.“In her talks with representatives of the United Arab Emirates, she has been promoting ambitious targets for the upcoming world climate conference,” the spokesperson said. “This also includes a commitment to gradually phase out fossil fuels. We are working for COP outcomes that initiate a true course correction towards 1.5 degrees.”Another document showed a talking point for China centered around ADNOC’s growth supporting energy security in the country, saying that the company was willing to “jointly evaluate” opportunities for LNG projects in places including Mozambique, Canada and Australia.The UAE wants to be removed from Brazil’s tax haven list, which would allow Masdar to invest more in the country, the briefing for that country showed. They also suggested Venezuelan “resources” could be monetized, since the US relaxed its energy sanctions on the country, and that ADNOC and Masdar could help Azerbaijan become an energy hub for Europe, “exporting natural gas and potentially clean electricity.”The other briefing notes shared were for Egypt, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia and Switzerland. The notes did not suggest oil and gas projects would be discussed with all those countries.For the US, for example, the briefing notes touch on potential renewable energy deals, saying Masdar hoped to grow its presence in the US by carrying out “acquisitions” in the short term.The COP28 climate talks come at a critical time, as scientists say the world is “virtually certain” to have experienced its hottest year on record in 2023, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, and the Earth is approaching a series of crucial tipping points.Greenpeace International said that the content of the briefings, if true, were “totally unacceptable and a real scandal.”“The climate summit leader should be focused on advancing climate solutions impartially, not backroom deals that are fuelling the crisis,” Kaisa Kosonen, policy coordinator at Greenpeace International, said in a statement. “This is exactly the kind of conflict of interest we feared when the CEO of an oil company was appointed to the role.”“This summit is the world’s most powerful forum to avert the biggest threat to the survival of humankind, and we urge the Presidency to act accordingly.”",6984,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/climate/uae-cop28-documents-al-jaber-climate-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point insight appoint potentially bias leader ethic strategy company international outcome strike organize host typically naturally kenya threat conviction backroom wean ceo humankind project growth promote independently significant demand united import role center make real coordinator year canada clear fuel act cache deal fear outline adnoc analysis scientist part azerbaijan export resource nominate renewable include earth reply extreme conflict close severe food experienced ramp avert presence incorrect change government ambitious expand kosonen preside petrochemical request europe statement ambition impartial team urge detail remain norway russian time economic fossil hop mention focus system masdar morgan spokesperson tax wider abu hottest jennifer course crucial cnn natural describe decide big accord provide planning security ensure mexico operating address addition deny read personal reserve previously share invest correction finance report suggestion unverified meet deference code mozambique forum organization vehicle profile uae favoritism china touch commitment issue caprice approach event energy gas netherlands document meeting frequent contact bbc talk jointly office crisis briefing evaluate action view provision question note suggest record number abroad survival cop email hub lng methane ready conference rule greenpeace saudi foreign expect disappoint egypt oil negotiation elect interest arabia explicitly decarbonize party ahead reporting launch policy country solution unfccc summit function compromise tip large monetize place target comment begin series kind discussion raise offer extremely national work potential initiate jaber official february powerful helm identify told contributor envoy inaccurate watchdog carry totally brazil leak business production france phase reach remove sends climate sanction hydrogen refer criticism discuss opportunity list world clean publish impartially preference show representative gradually centre germany upcoming weather prejudice virtually arab grow critical progress short uptake russia week switzerland venezuelan presidency unacceptable sultan component uk advance liquefy group chief body emirate content key confirm area position process supply federal relaxed widespread dhabi article support top acquisition renewables,0.985,0.0859106529209622,10.542763975155278,0.4528746367787464,0,2023-11-28
