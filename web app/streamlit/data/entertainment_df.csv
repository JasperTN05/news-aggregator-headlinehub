Washington Post,"In ‘Renaissance,’ Blue Ivy steps into her own power",2023-12-05 18:51:00,"Anne Branigin, Samantha Chery","By the time Lauren Marte and her 9-year-old daughter, Lyla Quinones Marte, walked into the Regal movie theater in Charlotte, they had already made a day of cosplaying Beyoncé. They began their Sunday with a mani-pedi at the nail salon then rolled up to the theater that afternoon in Marte’s Cadillac SUV in matching black faux leather leggings and furry pink jackets, their voices warmed up from singing along to the “Renaissance” album at the top of their lungs.Marte, a content creator and a die-hard Beyoncé fan, had seen the Renaissance concert when Bey played Charlotte earlier in the year. But for Lyla, “Renaissance: A film by Beyoncé,” was a first — she had never sat through a filmed concert before, let alone seen one live. And while Lyla was a fan of the singer, she was transfixed by someone else on-screen, Marte said — Beyoncé’s 11-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.“Every time Blue popped up on the screen, my daughter was like, ‘Blue! There’s Blue!’” Marte said. “My daughter just sat up on the edge of her seat like, ‘Yes, this is what I’ve been waiting for.’”The summer of 2023 saw Blue Ivy, a child born into the spotlight, embrace it and adapt to its demands in real time. Beyoncé’s fans have long had a special connection to her elder daughter, in whom they see the aspirational and the familiar: a child of musical royalty who inspires the same affection and protectiveness as a beloved niece. That attachment was clear during her memorable stage performances and is again on display in the new concert film “Renaissance.”The movie highlights how, for Beyoncé, the historic tour marked a number of full-circle moments for her: her childhood idol Diana Ross sang “Happy Birthday” to her during one of her L.A. shows; in fashion, song and spirit, she paid tribute to her gay “Uncle Johnny,” who introduced her to house and disco music and helped make costumes for Beyoncé’s former girl group, Destiny’s Child; she even reunited with members of Destiny’s Child when she performed in her hometown of Houston, a reunion she described as “healing.”But for many Beyoncé fans, the most powerful moment came when Blue Ivy joined her mom onstage during the tour.Daniel Hall, a 22-year-old social media consultant and Beyoncé fan account owner in Chicago, said he never expected to see Blue Ivy onstage for the Renaissance tour.“I was in a complete shock, chills over my body,” he said. “For her to be onstage on a tour, where there are primarily fans in the audience that know the gravity of that moment … that was so so fulfilling and so inspiring to me.”Blue Ivy first danced alongside Beyoncé during her Paris show in May. As Beyoncé recounts in the “Renaissance” documentary, she at first resisted the idea — which was all Blue’s.“Blue told me she was ready to perform, and I told her ‘no,’” Beyoncé says in the film. “I did not think it was an appropriate place for an 11-year-old, on the stadium stage. All the things I had to go through and the obstacles I had to overcome prepared me — and she hasn’t had that struggle.”They ended up striking a compromise: If Blue practiced and showed her commitment to performing, Beyoncé would allow her to do one show.That performance, in front of more than 70,000 people at Le Sade de France, went viral on social media — but to mixed reviews.Blue appeared visibly nervous in Paris, her head sometimes swiveling to look at her mother or dance captain Amari Marshall. Some criticized her dancing: the moves weren’t crisp enough; she missed steps; they knew other 11-year-olds who could dance better.Blue herself got wind of the criticism from a friend, according to Beyoncé. Her daughter felt like she had to prove herself. So she kept performing at various stops along the “Renaissance” tour, getting demonstrably better with each performance.“It was magical,” Beyoncé says. “Her confidence just grew and grew. It was a beautiful thing for her.”By the time Adrienne Carter, an insurance underwriter, saw the “Renaissance” tour in Charlotte this summer, Blue Ivy’s appearance was one of the most anticipated parts of the show. In the moments before Blue’s appearance, Carter noticed everyone around her craning their head, trying to catch a glimpse of Blue Ivy rising up from beneath the stage.The timing is also meaningful. She appears during “My Power,” a battle-cry of a song in which Beyoncé calls out her “bloodline, on the front line,” as well as “Black Parade,” an anthem of Black pride.When Blue’s upheld fist emerged, the crowd was ecstatic.“If I would have went to a show were Blue Ivy did not come out, I would honestly be disappointed,” Carter said. “To me, it was a defining moment of the tour.”Carter can remember when Beyoncé announced her pregnancy with Blue Ivy onstage at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, when the singer pulled back her sequined jacket at the end of “Love on Top” to reveal a baby bump.Seeing Blue Ivy grow up in the public eye has made her feel familiar, even if much of her life is aspirational: “She’s like my faraway niece that I will never meet,” Carter said.The daughter of a once-in-a-generation performer and Jay-Z, one of the greatest rappers of all time, Blue Ivy has been the subject of adoration and scrutiny since she was an infant.Beyoncé — and by extension, Blue Ivy — keeps many details of her personal life private. But their public moments have offered a window into their dynamic as mother and daughter.During a rehearsal for the Grammy Awards in 2014, Blue was given a microphone to talk to her mom onstage. Beyoncé instantly melted as she heard the 2-year-old say “Hi mommy” over and over again. On the red — in fact, blue — carpet at the London premiere of the movie, Beyoncé stepped away from the flashing cameras for her mom duties: “Wait a minute — she’s cold,” she told the photographers.Fans have long joked that Blue Ivy acts as Beyoncé’s manager, ever since she motioned for her parents to stop clapping at the 2018 Grammys. The running gag is alive and well, as the movie shows video proof that Blue’s mom kept “Diva” in the tour set thanks to the 11-year-old’s insistence.These moments help ground Beyoncé’s image — Beyhive members say they are reminded of their own families when witnessing these moments: mothers who coached their daughters in dancing; kids who relished performing because of the pride it brought their parents.But Blue Ivy has also received an undue amount of criticism because of who her mother is, fans say, recalling criticisms of Blue’s natural hair or facial features. Jay-Z alluded to this disparagement in his own retelling of Blue’s “Renaissance” tour story, in a CBS interview with Gayle King that aired in November.“I still get goose bumps just seeing her walk onstage — just because Blue’s been born into this world that she didn’t ask [for]. She’s been born into a life she didn’t ask for,” he said. “So for her, to be on that stage and reclaim her power, and the song is called ‘My Power,’ you can’t write a better script.”Victoria Harvey, a nonprofit development director who lives in Washington, D.C., said she didn’t consider herself the biggest fan of Beyoncé but was converted after seeing her perform — “I’ve never seen anything like that before.” The moment with Blue Ivy was especially powerful.She felt an enormous amount of pride in seeing Blue Ivy embody such confidence and poise: Here was a little Black girl, whom she once saw as a niece or little cousin, now a “young lady” coming into her own.It brought her to tears, Harvey said, to think of how Blue Ivy seemed to be stepping into a family legacy in real time. “I wish that opportunity for so many other Black young people,” Harvey said.",7655,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/12/05/blue-ivy-beyonce-renaissance-movie/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2YXGBKVNFMTYQZEA6RCRO6N3Y_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2YXGBKVNFMTYQZEA6RCRO6N3Y_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2YXGBKVNFMTYQZEA6RCRO6N3Y_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2YXGBKVNFMTYQZEA6RCRO6N3Y_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2YXGBKVNFMTYQZEA6RCRO6N3Y_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y2YXGBKVNFMTYQZEA6RCRO6N3Y_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,glimpse obstacle account cbs shock gag reclaim quinone born suv musical sequined swivel child body stage time charlotte blue alongside group subject minute instantly voice felt demonstrably facial legacy family onstage award cosplaying afternoon remember kid big public love nonprofit flash harvey set beyoncé dance london run ready documentary development daughter happy goose music window introduce primarily hall accord cold idol upheld regal ground faux audience undue confidence screen perform played miss popped johnny concert compromise fist announce rehearsal front gay mommy pull knew sing joked live aspirational paris attachment reunite lady powerful nail marte roll disco parade magical king emerge remind leather resist ross embrace stop receive melt amari convert demand give dynamic notice medium captain away number poise adrienne rapper witness meaningful talk theater crowd complete pink world natural houston day legging camera childhood fulfil ivy disparagement royalty bey proof coached mixed real offer connection director make beneath show grow cadillac criticize prepared former hair clear practice feel wait adapt top sat reveal clap opportunity strike singer warm long begin anthem uncle mom commitment album memorable described define sade recount parent premiere tour fact embody song friend visibly lauren display underwriter diva beloved protectiveness appropriate movie girl beautiful affection wish destiny lyla image private consider walk told year adoration duty carpet birthday join grammy amount performer seat cousin content step gravity transfixed elder move microphone retell faraway video diana marked write renaissance baby house paid personal detail back eye chill nervous jacket expect special black spirit owner gayle appearance manager recall furry performance life enormous grammys air line crane extension mtv great mother salon place overcome idea interview disappointed film familiar bloodline inspires wind tribute beyhive costume brought highlight prove scrutiny tear criticism social historic allude viral especially france chicago bump alive member meet pride hometown part summer power relish anticipate creator insurance fashion story earlier niece sunday edge crisp timing victoria pregnancy call inspire red head moment young rise reunion spotlight motion consultant catch washington marshall match heard stadium honestly feature carter act,0.9981,0.1959503592423252,7.08859296482412,0.3724386724386726,0,2023-12-05
ABC,"Denny Laine, founding member of the Moody Blues and Paul McCartney's Wings, dead at 79",2023-12-05 18:34:00,The Associated Press,"NEW YORK -- Denny Laine, a British singer, songwriter and guitarist who performed in an early, pop-oriented version of the Moody Blues and was later Paul McCartney's longtime sideman in the ex-Beatle's solo band Wings, has died at age 79.Laine, inducted five years ago into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Moody Blues, died Tuesday in Naples, Florida. The cause was interstitial lung disease, according to an announcement on Laine's Instagram page by his wife, Elizabeth Hines.His death comes almost exactly 50 years after the release of McCartney's acclaimed “Band On the Run” album, on which Laine played guitar and provided backing vocals. On Tuesday, McCartney posted a tribute to Laine on Instagram, calling him a “great talent with a fine sense of humor.”“We had drifted apart but in recent years managed to reestablish our friendship and share memories of our times together,” McCartney wrote.Laine was born Brian Frederick Arthur Hines, and changed his professional name in his early teens, in part in homage to the singer Frankie Laine.In 1964, around the time he turned 20, he joined Ray Thomas and Mike Pinder in forming the Moody Blues and sang lead on the group's breakthrough hit, “Go Now.” But the Moody Blues struggled to match their initial success, and by 1967 Laine had left, replaced by Justin Hayward. The Moody Blues then turned to the ambitious, classically influenced sounds of “Nights in White Satin"" and other songs.Laine worked as a solo artist and with such group's as Electric String Band and Ginger Baker's Air Force before he was brought into Wings by McCartney, whom he had known during his time with the Moody Blues.Founded in 1971, the year after the Beatles broke up, Wings went through various personnel changes over the following decade, with Laine, McCartney and McCartney's wife, Linda. the only ones remaining throughout. The band's No. 1 singles, most of them written by McCartney, included “My Love,” “Listen to What the Man Said” and the title track to “Band On the Run.” Laine helped write the million-selling “Mull of Kintyre.”McCartney disbanded Wings soon after Laine left in the early 1980s, but Laine contributed to McCartney's “Tug of War” and “Pipes of Peace” albums and added backing vocals to ""All Those Years Ago,"" George Harrison's tribute to the late John Lennon.",2337,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/denny-laine-founding-member-moody-blues-paul-mccartneys-105406014,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,version singer naples interstitial born hayward induct change single replace elizabeth decade paul band talent time blue album acclaim night george group influence drift memory thomas initial string late breakthrough release title sideman success disease announcement love year classically ago brian join struggle pipe laine run mike broke age pinder moody rock ginger white write instagram vocal page frankie harrison florida denny hall accord force songwriter arthur ambitious longtime perform played electric fine justin recent frederick homage tug air listen york early great hines john include sound disband roll provide manage wing death british remain tribute brought reestablish contribute lead linda ray left mull turn member peace mccartney part satin lennon professional post follow guitarist hit call guitar track solo fame friendship form personnel lung add match beatles backing wife work baker tuesday share artist,0.0635,0.0,8.502672413793103,0.3126748251748251,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,George Santos appears to be running for America’s Sassy Gay Friend,2023-12-05 18:08:00,Monica Hesse,"In the early days of YouTube — we’re talking 13 or 14 years ago — there was a series of popular videos called “Sassy Gay Friend,” which was built on the premise that history’s women could have saved themselves a lot of heartache if only they’d been accompanied by a man wearing a spangled pink scarf. “What are you doing?” the sassy gay friend demanded of Juliet as she was about to poison herself for Romeo. “What, what, what are you doing?” In another segment, he snarked with Eve over God’s declared punishment of painful childbirth: “He made vaginas too small and he’s looking for a scapegoat.”In 2023, the idea that a man should happily volunteer as an unpaid emotional-support homosexual for straight women is a tad dated. But for anyone who still feels their lives would improve with occasional injections of Sassy Gay Friend, there is now one man who seems happy to offer up his services, for a fee, and that man is disgraced former congressman George Santos.Santos, in case you’ve been missing the circus, is facing a bunch of federal charges (he has pleaded not guilty) and, more recently, was the subject of a scathing report from the House Ethics Committee, full of allegations both grave and hilarious. (He has called it a “disgusting politicized smear.”) On Friday, the New York Republican was expelled from the House of Representatives, only the sixth lawmaker in history to meet that fate. This week, he joined Cameo.“Megan! How are you, darling?” Santos drawled into the camera in one personalized video that soon appeared online. “I hear that ... life might be a little rocky now.” His advice: “Be yourself! Unapologetically. Just love yourself. Just make sure that you don’t buy in to the hate. ... You do you, girl! I’m cheering for ya!”Cameo, FYI, is a service that allows the public to purchase video greetings, well-wishes and pep talks from celebrities, filling out a few prompts for greater personalization. (“What is something special about the recipient you want Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi to know?”) There are some dignified thespians on the site, but, in general, the selection gives off an over-mortgaged Real Housewife-y vibe: D-listers more than willing to wish your friend a happy Hanukkah if it will pay for one more month of Equinox. Santos initially marked his Cameos at $75 apiece, a price that increased to $200 by the end of the day.What did $200 get you, from the man accused of using campaign funds to buy himself Botox? They got you this:“Hi, Katieee!” he said in a shaky handheld video uploaded Monday, wearing his trademark white-collared-shirt-and-dark-sweater combination. “... Botox keeps you young; fillers keeps you plump. Look, don’t let the haters get to you. Haters are going to hate. And if you have haters, that means you’re doing something right, girl, so just keep going. You’re a Harvard Law School girl!”Ignoring haters was a common theme in the Cameos that recipients chose to repost on social media throughout Monday and Tuesday, as was staying strong, as was being yourself — which is frankly a little rich coming from a man who apparently made false statements about working at Goldman Sachs, and about whether his mother escaped the South Tower on 9/11, and about whether he played volleyball at Baruch College.“Hey, James and Sophia! Congratulations on your engagement!” he enthused to one couple who, I am assuming, purchased a Santos message not out of genuine admiration but out of a sense that such a greeting is basically an NFT commemorating the current death spiral of American governance. “Hey, girl!” he began another. “Hey fantasy football league dorks!” “Hey you beautiful bastards!” “Enjoy life, live life, laugh!”Nobody is going to argue that Santos is offering up particularly transformative advice. You might, however, argue that serving up sassy platitudes on a third-tier media platform is at least less harmful than acting as the official mouthpiece for the 771,000 residents of Queens and Long Island that Santos was representing until less than a week ago.While still a member of Congress, Santos appeared to try out Sassy Gay Friend on a few occasions, but the timing was never quite right. In the middle of a consequential vote for House speaker, he posted photos of two similarly dressed female lawmakers on Twitter, demanding, “WHO WORE IT BEST?! (Disclaimer: I’m a big fan of this look — bright vibrant hues and shoulder pads are POWER MOVES).” One of the targeted women responded, simply: “...anyway.”But what is particularly interesting about Santos’s sassy foray into Cameo is the way that it seems to try to recast his messy foray into Congress. The political swindler is a known archetype. So is the saucy friend who DGAF. The first archetype is detestable; the second is beloved. On Cameo, Santos seems to be saying that we got him all wrong: We thought he was an evil political swindler, but really he’s bitchy and fun. The kind of guy who, sure, might misappropriate campaign funds to pay for his own expensive dinners, but, girl, if you’d been there with him, he would have used some of that money to buy you some margs and a Death by Chocolate. Ignore the haters!It’s a bizarre, brilliant move and, oddly, one of the few paths to redemption that I could see working for a man who, after being summarily voted out by 311 of his colleagues, immediately left the building and told a waiting gaggle of reporters, “To hell with this place.”",5431,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2023/12/05/george-santos-from-congress-to-cameo/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,vagina equinox online increase built heartache tad allegation redemption segment recipient sachs george charge margs act subject couple politicize fee spangle nft escape expel evil representative fund particularly filler drawl big pay public love argue saucy occasional ago stay committee hater popular circus lot happy disclaimer disgust spiral genuine report month hear miss played katieee prompt recast statement guy league gay fantasy save common ethic celebrity romeo similarly live political god poison south york greet serve swindler full vote santos hanukkah rocky hey history speaker hell target campaign queen eve football disgrace hate accompany commemorate enjoy demand give archetype combination consequential medium island talk guilty small premise goldman plead juliet general childbirth repost oddly pink brilliant day camera darling personalization expensive dork injection james real offer buy simply happily ignore offering engagement bunch personalize make botox dress former feel wait false pep law platitude declare congressman greeting apparently plump detestable unpaid long represent republican painful begin path punishment case lawmaker date unapologetically improve bright price monday hilarious fyi foray frankly respond sassy transformative immediately photo bizarre scarf service volunteer congratulation friend wrong advice snooki beloved current resident girl beautiful wish chocolate federal series snarked twitter year sophia bastard told megan join interest trademark vibe friday vibrant uploaded move rich wear video marked thespian theme pad kind building official house occasion basically woman wore mouthpiece apiece special money fill chose polizzi accuse cheer life recently early great colleague gaggle mother shaky handheld homosexual place strong cameo purchase idea female platform misappropriate reporter youtube harmful congress death american middle fate dignify enthuse site social selection grave left harvard laugh member meet message governance power bitchy post dinner assume straight sixth admiration initially timing shoulder call nicole summarily tower baruch young dgaf school fun work volleyball tuesday scathing week messy,0.99305,0.110476891916774,6.7644483671668105,0.4953128220985366,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Jonathan Majors accuser Grace Jabbari details alleged assault at trial,2023-12-05 18:03:00,Herb Scribner,"NEW YORK — Grace Jabbari was called as the first witness in Jonathan Majors’s misdemeanor assault trial Tuesday, describing the film star as a sometimes controlling, intimidating boyfriend in the months before he allegedly attacked her in the back of a chauffeured car this year.Entering the Manhattan courtroom in a plaid top and bottom, with a nervous smile, Jabbari took a deep breath before telling a six-person jury about Majors’s behavior over their two-year relationship. They met on the set of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” in 2021. She was a professional dancer, and he was a fast-rising member of Hollywood’s A-list.“He told me he loved me really early on,” she said, sometimes pausing to wipe away tears. “It seemed like he was really caring, he’d write me poetry. … I felt very loved and cared for and seen.”After a promising start, she testified, the relationship started to sour after a few months. She said she first felt afraid of Majors after he snapped at her for mentioning a dog she shared with her ex-partner.Jabbari went on to describe a devolving relationship in which Majors “was full of rage, aggression, throwing things, shouting in my face.” She said he once he made her leave a music festival early because spotty cell service made it hard to check in with him, and stomped on her headphones and tried to kick her out of a home in London after she brought a friend over while he was in the middle of a heavy production load.Seated at a table with his defense team, Majors flipped at the pages of a bible and largely avoided making eye contact with Jabbari as she testified about the low points of their time together. But he stared up at his ex as she described a March incident for which he is facing misdemeanor assault and harassment charges, with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.Prosecutors allege that the couple were being driven home to a shared apartment after a night on the town, when Jabbari saw a flirtatious text message on Majors’s phone. “He was, like, it’s nothing, nothing, it’s not what it seems,” she told the jury. “I was saying, ‘Let me see the message, let me see the message,’ and he wasn’t, so I just grabbed his phone and turned away from him.”As the couple wrestled over the phone, she said, she felt the weight of Majors on top of her, then she felt her arm pulled behind her and her head struck from behind. “He was twisting my arm, and my hand,” she said. “Like he wanted to make me feel pain, just like this excruciating thing.”Majors was arrested several hours after the incident and is accused by prosecutors of fracturing Jabbari’s finger, striking her ear and pushing her back into the Escalade when she tried to follow him out, among other offenses. He has pleaded not guilty, and his defense attorneys have claimed that Jabbari attacked him. New York police arrested Jabbari in late October on charges of assaulting Majors, but prosecutors immediately announced that the charges against her lacked merit and would be dropped.Majors’s career has been largely on ice since his arrest, which came as he prepared for roles in a series of Marvel projects after acclaimed performances in “Creed III” and “Quantumania.” Jabbari’s accusations led his public relations and management teams to drop him, according to trade publications. Disney reportedly dropped an upcoming Majors film, “Magazine Dreams,” from its release schedule, as well, despite the film already premiering at the Sundance Film Festival.Majors had a brief return to the screen during the second season of Marvel’s “Loki” Disney Plus series, which aired throughout the fall.His trial began last week with jury selection, after several postponements throughout the summer. On Monday, both sides delivered opening statements.",3765,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2023/12/05/jonathan-majors-trial-grace-jabarri/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6A7KR33AOUUFQW2UKLEJLVSURU_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6A7KR33AOUUFQW2UKLEJLVSURU_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6A7KR33AOUUFQW2UKLEJLVSURU_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6A7KR33AOUUFQW2UKLEJLVSURU_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6A7KR33AOUUFQW2UKLEJLVSURU_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6A7KR33AOUUFQW2UKLEJLVSURU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,side town jabbari hour smile march home time phone charge production couple arm felt deep ear star apartment release escalade describe mention love public set hard london throw merit music page stomp lack project publication accord despite screen month opening iii major announce statement pull allegedly york largely relation full breath upcoming season claimed role misdemeanor hollywood return aggression wrestle turn loki control ice push quantumania chauffeur devolve away witness jonathan kick guilty professional cell follow plead point boyfriend marvel make poetry behavior prepared share dancer feel top strike arrest twist sour grace begin leave punishment bible attack schedule disney testify weight intimidate night acclaim monday described relationship contact reportedly start immediately allege service career friend late avoid postponement harassment snap jury pain dream wipe offense series wasp told year hand fracture finger flip table write trade premier grabbed back eye heavy nervous low accusation courtroom team october incident accuse performance air early bottom prosecutor flirtatious film middle attorney deliver brought tear afraid creed trial car selection manhattan lead drop member message driven festival summer magazine rage check headphone defense excruciate management struck promising call head shout maximum text assault pause sundance spotty plaid police week tuesday,-0.95955,0.0,8.11531291611185,0.3753865182436611,0,2023-12-05
ABC,High-speed rail line linking Las Vegas and Los Angeles area gets $3B Biden administration pledge,2023-12-05 17:36:00,KEN RITTER Associated Press,"LAS VEGAS -- A planned high-speed rail line between Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area got a Biden administration pledge on Tuesday of $3 billion to help start laying track, Nevada elected officials said.The $12 billion project led by Brightline West has been talked about for decades, and U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen told reporters that it now has all required right-of-way and environmental approvals, along with labor agreements, for work to start on some 218 miles (351 kilometers) along the Interstate 15 corridor.No date was announced for work to start. But Rosen said electric-powered trains could be carrying passengers by the time Los Angeles hosts the Summer Olympics in 2028.“We’re ready to get to work,” Wes Edens, founder and chairman of Florida-based Brightline, said in a statement ahead of a Friday event in Las Vegas that may coincide with a visit by President Joe Biden.Rosen and U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, both Democrats, led a bipartisan group including all of Nevada’s elected federal lawmakers and four House members from California that in April urged Biden to commit up to $3.75 billion in federal infrastructure funds toward what they call a public-private partnership.Planners say trains carrying passengers at nearly 200 mph (322 kph) could cut in half a four-hour freeway trip from a station in Las Vegas through Victorville, California, to a suburban Los Angeles light rail line in the San Bernardino County city of Rancho Cucamonga.They say the service could help alleviate weekend or end-of-holiday travel traffic jams that often stretch for 15 miles (24 kilometers) on I-15 near the Nevada-California line.“Connecting Las Vegas and Southern California by high-speed rail will create tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs, boost our Southern Nevada tourism economy, and finally help us cut down on I-15 traffic,"" Cortez Masto said Tuesday in a statement.Calls for a high-speed rail line whisking tourists through the Mojave Desert to Las Vegas date at least to 2001, said U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat who represents the Las Vegas Strip. The proposal had starts, stops and various names over the years, before getting sidetracked during the COVID-19 pandemic.Florida-based Brightline Holdings LLC, which built the only privately-owned and operated intercity passenger railroad in the U.S., is expected to model the line on service it began in 2014 on Florida's east coast. That route now links Miami and Orlando with trains reaching speeds up to 125 mph (200 kph).",2505,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/high-speed-rail-line-linking-las-vegas-los-105405265,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d5dfca30-ba25-4417-b8b0-8fa44604b3a5/wirestory_8ee203c4acc17a1f320f534418532725_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,urge job kilometer victorville brightline built link jacky represent begin lawmaker proposal date decade time agreement interstate president light bernardino group chairman boost elect route cortez administration start service alleviate desert sidetrack orlando suburban vega fund coincide tourist thousand intercity event mojave olympics federal whisk told station year infrastructure county friday ready city passenger freeway lay bipartisan weekend project florida official wes house kph approval carry founder holding expect east train april trip traffic catherine announce statement jam area democrat west line cut angeles include titus miami reporter masto mile commit california speed stretch connect finally stop lead model southern joe biden create member plan require nevada rail summer ten union talk tourism llc environmental travel railroad ahead reach pledge call rancho track strip rosen economy billion half visit operate labor work host coast tuesday san mph,0.92385,0.0,11.638210290827736,0.4111111111111111,0,2023-12-05
CNN,"ChatGPT, Oppenheimer and Indian entertainment top the most-viewed Wikipedia pages in 2023",2023-12-05 17:13:00,Sergio Padilla,"Wikipedia’s top 25 most viewed pages in 2023, released Tuesday, reflect the world’s interest in innovation in artificial intelligence, people who died this year and the growing power of Indian users to influence trends on the website.Run by the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia has received more than 84 billion page views so far in 2023, according to data the foundation shared with CNN.Given its massive surge in popularity, the page about OpenAI’s virtual chatbot ChatGPT was the most viewed page on Wikipedia this year, amassing more than 49.4 million page views. ChatGPT set a record for the fastest-growing user base this past February, amassing 100 million active users in January. Other tech companies have poured billions into developing rival generative AI technology. Related tech companies make semiconductor chips capable of powering future AI innovations and affect geopolitical relationships between the world’s largest superpowers.“It’s clear that people wanted to better understand the history and the context behind ChatGPT’s technology as they experimented with it,” said Anusha Alikhan, chief communications officer at the Wikimedia Foundation in an interview with CNN.Alikhan added that ChatGPT is also trained using Wikipedia data, using Wikimedia projects to answer users’ questions or prompts. Wikipedia data and text, which is compiled by human users and editors, play a role in the responses that the chatbot produces to its users.“Wikipedia plays an essential role in training almost every large language model,” said Alikhan.She added that because of the foundation’s nonprofit status, they do not charge OpenAi for the use of its content. It’s also the same reason why the company doesn’t have advertisements or track users’ private information.Joining ChatGPT in the rest of the top five were biographical posts about people who died in 2023, the 2023 Cricket World Cup, the Indian Premier League, which is a Cricket league, and the movie “Oppenheimer.”India and Southeast Asian audiences made a big impact on 2023’s list, as a fifth of the list consisted of media from that region and the country of India itself.“Right now we have about 4,700 active English Wikipedia volunteer editors in India,” said Alikhan. “That total puts them behind only the United States and the United Kingdom. India has… a rich media environment and information technology sector.”Given that India is likely to overtake China as the most populated country in the world, with a population estimated to reach 1.43 billion by the end of the year according to the United Nations, its influence on global media isn’t surprising. China’s government bans Wikipedia from the country’s internet.According to the Internet and Mobile Association of India and market data analytics firm Kantar, the number of active internet users in India is expected to grow to 900 million from 759 million currently.The 2023 Cricket World Cup, a sport already popular in India, featured India as a runner-up to the eventual Champion Australia, with top-order batter Virat Kohli winning player of the series. The Wikipedia entry about the series drew more than 38 million page views.Alikhan said this was the first time on record that Cricket-related articles had appeared in Wikipedia’s top 25, which the foundation has published every year since 2015.The Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 Men’s Cricket league, appeared twice. The page for the league itself received more than 32 million views and the 2023 season receiving more than 20 million views.The pages for two action films from India’s Bollywood, “Jawan” and “Pathaan” also made the list as some of the most-viewed pages, beating the pages for highly-grossing American films like “Barbie” and “Avatar: The Way of Water.”Barbie, the film distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, brought in more than $1.4 billion globally at the box office, while Oppenheimer brought in more than $950 million. However, the latter received more interest on Wikipedia.The Oppenheimer film received more than 28 million page views, the page about real-life physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer himself received 25.6 million views while the Barbie film received 18 million.The list was otherwise filled with influential figures in sports, entertainment and business. Taylor Swift, Elon Musk and Lionel Messi are top news-makers within their respective crafts and that showed in the number of times their pages were viewed on Wikipedia.Swift’s music continues to dominate charts alongside the success of the Eras Tour and subsequent concert film; Musk’s constant flirtation with controversy through social media posts, public comments and business decisions; and Messi’s debut as captain for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami.Less desirable topics and figures made the list too. Though somewhat overshadowed by news of the war in Gaza, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw close to 12.8 million views on Wikipedia.Hamas’ attack on Israel, which sparked the newest chapter in a decades-long conflict, occurred later in the year, on October 7, which is likely why it didn’t make the list, compared to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which started in February of 2022.Last on the list was Andrew Tate, the bigoted and self-proclaimed misogynist influencer, who has been indicted of rape and human trafficking in Romania. His page received more than 12.7 million views.Tate, who was re-platformed on X, formerly Twitter, following Musk’s ownership of the social media site, has prompted educators, police, human rights advocates and politicians to warn against his influence on youth, particularly young men.A full list of pages, by rank and number of page views is available below.1.

Washington Post,Woman sentenced to fast-food job after hurling Chipotle bowl at worker,2023-12-05 17:05:00,Amber Ferguson,"Emily Russell was a store manager at an Ohio Chipotle when an irate customer hurled a chicken burrito bowl at her face. Now a judge has sentenced the customer to work at a fast-food job to avoid further jail time.Rosemary Hayne, 39, was found guilty of one count of assault on Nov. 28 after admitting to throwing the burrito bowl at Russell in September.“This is not ‘Real Housewives of Parma.’ This behavior is not acceptable,” Judge Timothy Gilligan of Parma Municipal Court said during sentencing, according to WJW, a Cleveland Fox affiliate that covered the sentencing in the courtroom. “You didn’t get your burrito bowl the way you like it, and this is how you respond?”Hayne’s behavior went viral in a video showing her screaming at Russell, 26, then grabbing her food and throwing it directly in Russell’s face.At first, Hayne was slated to pay a fine and undergo a 180-day jail term, with 90 days suspended. However Gilligan offered her a chance to reduce her sentence with a highly unusual proposition.The judge presented her with an opportunity to cut her sentence by 60 days in exchange for consenting to work 20 hours per week at a fast-food restaurant for two months. Hayne agreed.In the courtroom, Russell, the victim, told the judge the past two months have been the worst of her life. And she said she deals with the trauma of the incident daily.She told The Washington Post that she was protecting a 17-year-old employee who was getting yelled at by Hayne. She remade her order twice and included extra protein and other ingredients to appease Hayne, she said. Hayne left with her food but returned a few minutes later. “She started screaming at me. … The next thing I knew she threw the food in my face. I was so embarrassed and in shock.” She said the food was 200 degrees because she had just made it and left her face burning red. “I couldn’t believe my customers had to witness that.”Russell, who worked at Chipotle for more than four years, and has been in the service industry for nine, says she had drinks and sandwiches thrown at her by customers but never experienced something so violent at work before.“I had to work with food in my face and hair for the next four hours after it happened because no one was sent to relieve me,” Russell said. She said she went to the emergency room after her shift.Hayne was found at her home seven minutes after a 911 call, Parma police Lt. Dan Ciryak said. The report states, “Rosemary [Hayne] admitted that she became angry when a worker had incorrectly made her food at Chipotle and that she threw the food at the cashier. … She was sorry for what she had done.”“It was pretty easy to locate her, as the caller provided her license plate information and the female’s receipt displayed her first name as Rosie along with her phone number,” Ciryak said.“The health and safety of our employees is our greatest priority, and we’re pleased to see justice served for any individual that does not treat our team members with the respect they deserve,” said Laurie Schalow, Chipotle’s chief corporate affairs officer.Russell says Chipotle was “unsupportive” after the assault and she didn’t feel safe. “I was working 65 hours a week. I was exhausted. I had anxiety every day going to work,” she said. She quit a month after the incident.She has gotten supportive comments from people across the United States and is glad to share her story if it can help other fast-food workers.“Everyone has bad days, but it should never come to a point where you have to mistreat a human being,” she said.She’s happy with the judge’s sentence, saying “she got exactly what she deserved” and now gets to walk in her shoes.A GoFundMe campaign has raised nearly $2,000. Russell said she has used the money to help pay her bills and hopes to start therapy soon.",3802,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/12/05/chipotle-bowl-throw-sentence/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,deal yell acceptable hour found home unusual worker mistreat phone relieve degree happen minute employee parma burrito anxiety undergo grab caller gofundme raise pay exhaust corporate throw russell happy license sentence term accord individual municipal judge rosie month gilligan report displayed supportive knew sorry easy hurl human bill order thrown comment serve bowl provide priority violent campaign return jail cleveland past plate receipt irate restaurant hayne chipotle affair deserve respect housewife number witness guilty exchange health threw justice day cashier unsupportive ohio point trauma real offer safe make show hair slat behavior share customer feel emergency job opportunity safety industry respond scream laurie directly affiliate united start embarrass service avoid believe highly pleased remade room walk locate told year state cover experienced hope treat video fox ingredient pretty protein incorrectly store reduce courtroom money team suspend fine incident sandwich victim manager life cut ciryak information therapy great glad include chicken female food count angry burning viral left admit consent protect member schalow present emily drink chief post story quit appease call red timothy court wjw chance washington extra rosemary assault work police week,0.94925,0.2367175170962651,7.363994811932553,0.4885185185185185,0,2023-12-05
CNN,Joey King finds ‘Kissing Booth’ costar Jacob Elordi’s criticism of the franchise ‘unfortunate’,2023-12-05 17:02:00,not specified,"Joey King doesn’t agree with her “Kissing Booth” costar Jacob Elordi’s criticism of their Netflix franchise.The actress responded to Variety recently about Elordi’s less than flattering words about the beloved teen rom-coms.“I think it’s unfortunate anyone would feel that way,” King said. “I had a great time making those movies no matter what anyone says.”Elordi talked about the franchise to GQ in November.“I didn’t want to make those movies before I made those movies,” he told the publication “Those movies are ridiculous. They’re not universal. They’re an escape.”Elordi said he took the role which helped to make him a star because he needed a job.When the GQ writer pointed out that the gig could be a “‘one for them, one for me’ ethos that can be fairly commonplace in Hollywood,” Elordi said “That one’s a trap as well.”“Because it can become 15 for them, none for you,” he said. “You have no original ideas and you’re dead inside. So it’s a fine dance. My ‘one for them,’ I’ve done it.”His remarks didn’t go over well with some of his fellow “Kissing Booth” casemates.Taylor Zakhar Perez also costarred in the franchise and told Variety, “I thought it was a shame because to my knowledge, everybody else had such a wonderful experience.”“Especially when those movies came out, it was a time when we really needed something like that,” he said. “I know from our fan interactions, getting stopped everywhere I go, what ‘Kissing Booth’ means to people and what it brought them during such a dark time. I guess the silver lining is he still made people laugh and feel good.”",1582,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/entertainment/joey-king-jacob-elordis-response/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205115014-01-kissing-booth-3-netflix.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,feel dead zakhar time original shame respond costar joey star universal booth beloved movie guess trap gig writer ethos told jacob costarred flatter inside dance perez publication elordi fairly fine dark netflix kiss recently commonplace line great variety idea king actress agree role remark brought criticism franchise hollywood silver stop especially ridiculous laugh fellow unfortunate knowledge talk matter word gq point interaction make wonderful,0.7114,0.0,5.273220338983048,0.5458333333333333,0,2023-12-05
CNN,Artist Jesse Darling wins the prestigious 2023 Turner Prize,2023-12-05 16:48:00,Jacqui Palumbo,"Artist Jesse Darling is the latest recipient of the Turner Prize, the UK’s top award for artists that grants £25,000 ($31,500) annually. The announcement was made on Tuesday at an evening ceremony in Eastbourne, southeast England.Darling is a 41-year-old Oxford-born, Berlin-based multidisciplinary artist working across sculpture, video, drawing and performance; he also released a collection of poetry, “Virgins,” last year. His Turner Prize-winning exhibition is an installation that places viewers in a custom-built environment evoking chaotic city streets and industrial barriers.Barbed wire frames the entryway to a gallery space where anthropromophized crowd-control fences stampede across the floor and climb the walls. Tattered patchwork Union Jack flags hang from bent and twisted poles and railroad tracks careen into a wall; unsettling props like crutches, dusty piles of ring binders and chunks of concrete are also placed throughout. The installation is made of both new and earlier works by the artist and “convey(s) a familiar yet delirious world,” according to a press release. “Invoking societal breakdown, his presentation unsettles perceived notions of labour, class, Britishness and power.”Darling was nominated alongside fellow artists Ghislaine Leung, Rory Pilgrim and Barbara Walker, who all exhibited installations for the award. (All their work will remain on display at the Towner Eastbourne art gallery through April 14, 2024.)The Turner Prize, named after the 19th-century painter JMW Turner, is awarded each year to an exemplary artist born or based in the UK, and based on a presentation of work exhibited in the past year. Darling was nominated for his solo exhibitions “No Medals, No Ribbons” at Modern Art Oxford and “Enclosures” at the Camden Art Centre.Last year’s prize was awarded to sculptor Veronica Ryan, and past honorees have included Damien Hirst, Gillian Wearing, Gilbert & George, Anish Kapoor, Wolfgang Tillmans and Steve McQueen.

CNN,Sublime poster for ‘Feud’ Season 2 is up to its neck in female star power,2023-12-05 16:47:00,Dan Heching,"Ryan Murphy is at it again with some more high society drama in Season 2 of “Feud,” the long-awaited followup to the first outing in 2017.On Tuesday, FX unveiled a first-look at the poster for the series, which features stars Demi Moore, Molly Ringwald, Naomi Watts, Chloe Sevigny, Diane Lane and Calista Flockhart.In the image, the sextet of women are displayed against a black background, wearing variations of swan dresses that look like what Bjork wore to the 2001 Oscars. The women are featured above the subhead, “The original housewives.”Titled “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans,” the new season of the series will explore the relationship between celebrated novelist Truman Capote (here played by Tom Hollander) and his close group of upperclass socialite friends, with whom he had a famous falling out.The season will also star Murphy mainstay Jessica Lange, along with the late Treat Williams.Capote has been portrayed by various actors in the past, including by Philip Seymour Hoffman in his Oscar-winning role in “Capote” in 2005. Toby Jones also portrayed the famed author of “In Cold Blood” one year later, in the movie “Infamous” opposite Sandra Bullock.Season 1 of “Feud,” which premiered on FX in March 2017, covered the fraught relationship between Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Lange) during the making of 1962’s “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?”“Feud: Capote vs. the Swans” will premiere on January 31, 2024 on FX and will stream on Hulu.",1471,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/entertainment/feud-season-2-poster-demi-moore/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205142709-01-demi-moore-fx-show.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,swan upperclass ringwald truman fraught sandra watt variation novelist crawford ryan march unveiled original moore group jones relationship happen sevigny calista drama hollander premiere naomi star friend january davis late portrayed jessica title bette toby sarandon movie molly image series hulu year cover treat wear high socialite followup baby famed premier lange chloe lane bjork jane cold woman wore fall black displayed played society fx tom opposite murphy explore infamous close blood poster feud capote include stream season subhead philip background role sextet past oscar mainstay diane actor famous hoffman author joan susan celebrate make feature seymour dress tuesday,0.9158,0.0,8.809072164948454,0.5132007575757576,0,2023-12-05
ABC,Jonathan Majors trial: Grace Jabbari testifies against ex-boyfriend in domestic violence case,2023-12-05 16:42:00,Aaron Katersky,"Grace Jabbari, the accuser in the misdemeanor assault case against actor Jonathan Majors, took the stand as the first witness on the second day of the trial Tuesday.Jabbari, 30, wearing plaid pants and a plaid jacket, answered questions from Assistant District Attorney Kelli Galaway, appearing to take a deep breath and exhale as she began her direct examination.""I am Grace Jabbari, nice to meet you,"" she said as she introduced herself to the jury. ""I'm a professional dancer.""Majors, 34, sat at the defense table in a gray suit after entering the courtroom with current girlfriend Meagan Good, who has attended each day of the proceedings. He carried a cup and a Bible.Majors did not appear to look at Jabbari as she described her dance training and career. Members of Jabbari's family sat in the front row, on the opposite side of the aisle from Majors' relatives and friends.Majors, who has played the role of Kang in several Marvel films and TV shows, is accused of assaulting Jabbari in the backseat of a for-hire SUV on March 25 after she allegedly grabbed his phone when a message from another woman popped up that said ""wish I was kissing you.""Majors has pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor assault and harassment charges. He faces up to a year in jail if convicted.Jabbari detailed the night of the alleged assault, which she said occurred as they returned home from dinner in a for-hire Cadillac Escalade. She said her head was resting on his shoulder and they were chatting as he was scrolling on his phone when a message popped up saying, ""I wish I was kissing you.""""I was so taken aback,"" Jabbari said. ""I was so shocked. I never considered infidelity to be one of the things that was happening. So I was upset.""She said Majors denied the message had meaning but ""he was just really alert like he had been called out,"" she recalled. ""I was saying, 'Let me see the messages, let me see the messages.' So I grabbed his phone and turned away from home.""At that point, she said she ""felt a heavy thud on top of me. What I knew to be the weight of him on top of me and him trying to pry the phone out of my fingers.""She described Majors pulling her right hand behind her back while holding the phone in her left.""It just felt like he was twisting my arm and my hand and trying to make me feel pain.""When Galaway asked to describe her level of pain, Jabbari responded, ""I had a lot of pain but my emotional state was only thinking about the infidelity. I was just thinking, 'Who is this girl?'""Majors has denied her accusations and said she was the aggressor in the March 25 incident. The defense claimed Monday that Jabbari slapped, clawed and otherwise physically attacked Majors so blatantly that night the driver of their for-hire SUV called her ""psycho girl.""Defense attorney Priya Chaudhry said during opening arguments Jabbari emerged unscathed and unhurt while Majors was left bloodied and ran to a hotel to hide from her.Earlier in her testimony, Jabbari said Majors first became angry with her in December 2021 and detailed several instances of him being mean or aggressive.Among the incidents was one Jabbari recalled from July 2022 when he started throwing things at her in a home they were sharing in West Hollywood.""The first thing that he threw was the candle,"" Jabbari said, as she showed the jury a photo of the room. ""The dent in the wall is one of the candles.""She used a pen to mark the spot where she was standing.""I took the photo because the shift in his temper was something that I was aware of,"" Jabbari said. ""I just wanted to remember. I know I kept forgiving him but I wanted to have a bit of a memory of it.""Jabbari often testified through nervous laughter, occasionally finishing her responses with a giggle.""Is this a test?"" she asked after Galaway asked her the ages of her three siblings.Jabbari was movement director on the set of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" in Pinewood, United Kingdom, when she met Majors, whom she acknowledged seeing in the courtroom.""In one of the breaks he came over to me, near-ish the monitor, and asked me what I was doing, why I was here and I said, 'Oh I'm a dancer, I'm working on movement,'"" Jabbari testified.She said his hair stylist slipped her his number and the two went on a date. The relationship progressed ""fast,"" she said.""We spent every day together, maybe minus a few, within the next few months,"" Jabbari said. ""He told me he loved me very early on.""Jabbari said Majors would quote her poetry.""I felt very loved and cared for,"" she said.Jabbari said the first time Majors became angry with her was in December 2021 when she was going to meet his dogs.She said Majors gave her specific instructions for how to behave around the dogs. At that point, Jabbari mentioned how an ex-boyfriend had a dog and she said he became angry and raised his voice.""How dare I mention him,"" Jabbari quoted Majors telling her. ""It's embarrassing to him that I dated him. His dog is pathetic. This kind of stuff.""""It was the first time I felt scared of him,"" she told the jury.Jabbari also described a time in June 2022 when she went to a festival where cellphone reception was not very good and Majors was ""not very nice"" about it.""Just that I shouldn't be there and how dare I go,"" she said. ""You're just out there drinking with your friends and I had a really hard week.""He had been training as a bodybuilder for a movie, Jabbari said, and ""he was quite stressed.""By September 2022, Jabbari was living with Majors in London while he was shooting a movie. She recounted a Sunday when she had been at a pub with friends and returned to the house with them.""He was getting a bit snappy. Just quick with his responses,"" she said. Jabbari said she ushered everyone out of the house. The following day she said they met at a park when he accused her of being an alcoholic, tore headphones off her head and started shouting at her.""Better not be in the house when I get home,"" Jabbari quoted Majors saying that day.Jabbari broke down in tears on the stand after recounting the story and asked the judge for a break.Upon resuming her testimony, Jabbari said she left the park and returned to the home she was sharing with Majors and started to pack but ""froze"" when she heard Majors coming.""He proceeded to grab everything ... and was just throwing it, swiping it, moving it and throwing it, anything I had bought him he was breaking,"" Jabbari said. ""I just said, 'You can stop, I'm leaving, just please stop.'""She said it left her scared, upset and confused, and that he was ""blaming"" her because she ""disturbed the peace, or something like that.""The jury heard a recording Jabbari made with her iPhone of Majors shouting at her, demanding she behave like Coretta Scott King or Michelle Obama.""I'm a great man. A great man. I do great things for my culture and for the world. ... The woman that supports me needs to be a great woman,"" Majors is heard on the recording saying. ""Two nights ago, you did not do that. Which took away from the plan.""Jabbari said she understood it to mean that ""he had to come first."" Through halting sobs, Jabbari described what happened after he stopped shouting.""I just kept saying 'I'm sorry' and I took all the blame,"" Jabbari testified. ""I just took the full blame to calm him down.""She said she promised she would not tell anyone what happened and was left ""quite scared of him and yet dependent on him.""After Majors would get upset with Jabbari, she testified he would threaten suicide.""He said that he was a monster and that he wants to kill himself and he has put actions in place to do so,"" Jabbari testified while recounting one instance on Sept. 22, 2022.She said she pleaded with him not to and tried to ""make him feel safe and loved and secure.""She said Majors would blame her, say it was her fault he got angry in the first place.""Maybe he would say that he was sorry, but rarely,"" Jabbari said. ""I just felt like I was existing in his world and emotionally and physically and all these ways did not really feel my own autonomy.""In January, the two relocated to New York. Jabbari said she spoke to Majors' manager about his behavior because she ""needed some support."" She told the jury it caused Majors to stop talking to her for a couple of weeks.If you are struggling with thoughts of suicide or worried about a friend or loved one, call or text the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for free, confidential emotional support 24 hours a day, seven days a week.",8472,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jonathan-majors-trial-grace-jabbari-testifies-boyfriend/story?id=105390594,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c0230a91-5e07-437f-91b4-dfc2f0b01413/jon-majors-mo_1701792200488_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,gray rarely side shock girlfriend halt jabbari tore shoot forgive specific understood suv hour relative march home minus time phone charge psycho infidelity rest happen couple memory arm obama voice felt deep grab january family aggressor scar reception raise escalade bodybuilder hide meagan remember chat fast describe free mention love kelli training spent struggle slap set action priya ago question hard dance london broke aisle throw laughter lot dare spoke emotional exist introduce quick instruction judge month played opening popped opposite major front unscathed quote pull accuser knew kiss west sorry allegedly proceeding york kang drinking stylist secure deny full scroll monitor breath claimed king emerge progress threaten michelle role misdemeanor pathetic hollywood return jail stop giggle instance pack turn demand give record plan quantumania september finish fault shift culture away number witness jonathan talk guilty tv professional clawed dependent follow plead threw world galaway day sob blame coretta occur bloody point autonomy aback chaudhry marvel meaning candle testimony alcoholic disturbed safe director make show poetry hair cadillac cup enter examination share dancer feel temper sat top assistant twist dent living grace answer response begin cellphone stand case leave physically date attack testify weight night monday worried described respond relationship detailed snappy movement united recount start unhurt test allege photo embarrass career friend ran upset stress harassment iphone current jury pain girl movie resume exhale wish ushered consider break room mark stuff attend froze bought driver wasp year thud told hand state nice pinewood december park move age wear finger behavior table pry slip kind house pub grabbed kingdom scott back heavy nervous carry jacket woman hold argument accusation courtroom support incident crisis manager direct recall accuse promise backseat early great suicide relocate place lifeline film row calm bit acknowledge attorney blatantly tear july pant proceed trial angry emotionally left monster suit member peace meet actor message festival alert swipe level dinner headphone pen confidential wall defense aware confuse story sunday behave shoulder kill call june head occasionally shout put text assault heard work plaid spot week district,-0.15845,0.2124645892351274,5.774933920704843,0.4777419893903409,0,2023-12-05
ABC,"Top TV of 2023: AP’s selections include ‘Succession,’ ‘Jury Duty,’ ‘Shrinking,’ ‘Swarm’",2023-12-05 16:29:00,ALICIA RANCILIO Associated Press,"With so many shows on TV and streaming services, it's impossible not to miss a gem or two. This year's top television offerings as selected by The Associated Press include a mix of dramas and comedies that will draw you in.Some are new, some have already ended their runs and some have new episodes on the horizon. There's no time like December to add a title to your growing TBW (to be watched) list or settle in for a marathon during that time warp between Christmas and New Year’s when no one knows what day it is.Here are 10 shows from 2023 that simply shouldn't be missed.Let's start off with a public service announcement to watch “The Bear” if you haven't already. The FX show about an award-winning, fine dining chef named Carmy (played by Jeremy Allen White), who returns home to Chicago to run his late brother’s dive quietly debuted on Hulu in 2022 and was a word of mouth and critical hit. Season two did not experience a sophomore slump. In fact, it excelled. Any given episode can make you laugh, cry, feel anxious and excited by its genius casting of guest stars.Episode six, called “Fishes,” is a masterpiece.“Schitt's Creek” ended its run in 2020 and left a void for a show about acceptance and unlikely friendships. It was humanity at its best and yet still funny, quotable and meme-worthy. Fans missing that vibe should watch “The Big Door Prize,” which follows the residents of a small town whose lives are turned upside down when a new game called Morpho appears in the general store that promises to tell each user what their life’s potential is. Some of Morpho's answers prompt people to make major changes, while others feel dejected, insecure or second guess the results. Each episode follows a different character's reaction to their Morpho reveal. The show's charming cast is led by Chris O'Dowd with the story based on a novel by M.O. Walsh. And yes, it has a “Schitt's Creek” connection — its showrunner is David West Read, a ""Schitt's Creek executive producer and writer.Good news for fans: season two is coming.After 27 seasons of “The Bachelor,” the franchise managed to lure in viewers with a senior-centric version of the show called “The Golden Bachelor.” Instead of hate-watching, people tuned in as a 70-something widower named Gerry Turner set out to find a new partner. The streaming numbers set a record on Hulu. Turner told The Associated Press he believed people could feel the authenticity of the cast. “I never once questioned anyone’s motives about being on the show. At the age of 70, you’re only there for the right reason.”Even better: Turner’s wedding will air live on ABC Jan. 4.Dominique Fishback was already a rising Hollywood star when she landed the lead in “Swarm,” but now she’s an Emmy nominee for this seven-episode satirical slasher. Co-created by Donald Glover, Fishback plays Dre, an obsessed fan of a Beyoncé-like R&B singer named Ni’Jah whose fan base is dubbed the swarm. Dre’s devotion to Ni’Jah is unhinged and deadly. A commentary on celebrity worship, ""Swarm"" features Chloe Bailey in a recurring role and Damson Idris, Paris Jackson, Halsey and Billy Eilish are among guest stars.For a lighter offering that takes on celebrity, particularly the internet famous, there's the “The Other Two.” Created by two former “Saturday Night Live” writers, the show followed Cary and Brooke, the older brother and sister of a teen pop idol, Chase — who goes by Chase Dreams. Canceled by Max after three seasons, the show is still worth a watch for how it pokes fun at internet culture, millennials, celebrities and sibling rivalry.Drew Tarver and Heléne Yorke play the older siblings, Molly Shannon is their mother and momager to a clueless Chase, played by Case Walker.For a dark comedy about an unhealthy fixation, look no further than the limited series “Beef.”Ali Wong and Steven Yeun play two people almost get into a car accident in a parking lot and the incident escalates to road rage on ’roids. Instead of eventually calming down and moving on, the two become obsessed with ruining the other by infiltrating each other’s lives and wreaking havoc. At some point you may start to wonder, do these two actually like each other?Wong told AP earlier this year: “At first you think it’s about these two people who are enemies, but they keep involving each other in each other’s lives and they keep coming back to each other. And there’s a reason for that. It’s because they are letting those walls down. They’re seeing each other at their ugliest and the worst but somehow it’s very connecting and they still want to be around each other.”In “Jury Duty,” everyman Ronald Gladden is led to believe he was picked for and then sequestered on a jury trial being filmed for a documentary. Everyone surrounding Gladden is an actor, including James Marsden, who plays a hilarious, heightened version of himself. The situations that occur from “witness” testimony to interactions among the other jury members is so absurd, it's amazing Gladden never caught on. The best part is his reaction to the truth in the final episode.The series was created by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, the duo who wrote the “Dinner Party” episode of “The Office,” which was uncomfortable humor at its finest.Something happened between season one and season two of HBO’s “Perry Mason” starring Mathew Rhys. It got good.The first season had an impressive cast but it was an origin story of Mason the attorney, and the guy was dark: broke, divorced, angry and a drunk. The story was also hard to follow. Season two, however, did a 180. The central mystery was gripping, its supporting characters served the story, there were some light moments, and Mason showed his investigative skills that helped him to be a successful lawyer. And then... it was also canceled, but you can still watch on Max.Therapy and grief don't sound like a recipe for a feel-good comedy, but “Shrinking” pulls it off. Jason Segel stars as Jimmy, barely coping with the recent death of his wife and making bad choices all around, as his teenage daughter resentfully watches from the sidelines and is essentially being raised by a neighbor (Christa Miller.) The irony? Jimmy is a therapist whose colleagues are played by Harrison Ford and Jessica Williams — each with their own set of issues playing out in their lives.Segel created the series with Bill Lawrence (“Scrubs,” “Cougar Town”) and Emmy winner Brett Goldstein, who played Roy Kent on “Ted Lasso.” Their creation is a show where each character is delightful, and the writing is smart and quick and honest.Yes, most people know of “Succession.” The drama aired its series finale on HBO in the spring after four seasons but for those who haven't watched it, now is the time to discover what the hype is about. The show about the Roy family — one-percenters who own a large media conglomerate — was nominated for 27 Emmy Awards and 14 of those are in acting categories. At its center is patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox), who has four adult children and three want to be his successor.",7045,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/top-tv-2023-aps-selections-include-succession-jury-105402747,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a6b6dd4d-46f8-4618-a11b-8760bbe915c7/wirestory_3decb6ead812b5bf9e9036cb63ed8ba0_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,town draw change teenage home time essentially skill happen saturday successful star ugliest ted impossible family jessica award title choice issue molly horizon big delightful hulu absurd set momager lot brett daughter enemy quick jah acceptance office miss played impressive pull celebrity west paris ronald bill associate serve dive successor lawyer role satirical television return fishback connect picked devotion give record instead medium morpho bachelor small base day limited word gene turner commentary swarm point james testimony havoc interaction unhealthy bear slump involve truth make conglomerate jeremy former category feel version fish perry r motif case mix excite damson light chris eilish select fact authenticity service late believe creek shannon jury find sequester announcement dream resentfully lawrence writer creation year december vibe max age carmy void shrink bailey write billy mason slasher hbo quietly fixation road donald everyman incident final dark wedding life david therapist logan center sideline colleague mother guest sound stream williams dubbed manage death calm wreak attorney miller christmas producer gladden party lead irony watch prize land eventually chicago marathon create laugh member press surround actor scrub grief famous dinner idris story earlier cancel roy showrunner cry call jimmy stupnitsky critical add fun feature parking rhys adult insecure goldstein reason mouth central child jason ruin amaze heighten deject situation discover drama emmy episode particularly raise brooke settle public mystery question drunk comedy hard run finale broke character accident uncomfortable documentary millennials news white reaction kent game sophomore chloe dre warp idol recipe tarver origin fx prompt major schitt guy chef live infiltrate patriarch heléne quotable walsh tbw executive grip season funny user pop marsden hollywood roids duo experience turn cop culture glover charm number witness read yorke tv follow internet general upside result hit occur friendship sister large simply connection offering eisenberg humanity show grow top reveal singer christa widower genius answer spring wonder lee nominate divorce night hilarious winner start lighter humor resident guess poke ford brother series told duty brian jackson move cast harrison back obsess store support halsey yeun golden gem fine worship neighbor recent unhinged chase air promise potential different include deadly film investigative hype debut anxious franchise trial mathew car angry barely steven left list worth b cox abc part clueless sibling smart rage wall recur cougar caught nominee excel escalates lure moment rise partner gerry viewer segel wife play cary act,0.98165,0.170333569907736,7.373603351955307,0.4969865761150164,0,2023-12-05

A judge is expected to rule at a later date.""He should be placed in a bespoke position and that bespoke arrangements be… specifically tailored to him,"" government attorney James Eadie said. ""He is no longer a member of the cohort of individuals whose security position remains under regular review.""The committee considered the wider impact the ""tragic death"" of his mother, Princess Diana, had on the nation and in making its decision gave greater weight to the ""likely significant public upset were a successful attack"" on him to happen, Eadie said.Eadie also said there was a cost factor, because security funds aren’t unlimited. He noted that Harry has been granted protection for certain events, such as his visit in June 2021 when he was chased by photographers after attending a charity event for seriously ill children at Kew Gardens in west London.PRINCESS DIANA'S BODYGUARD ON PRINCE HARRY AND MEGHAN MARKLE'S CAR CHASE: 'ONLY GETTING A PART OF THE STORY'The Duke of Sussex has claimed the committee in charge of the decision unfairly canceled his security request and included a former private secretary to Queen Elizabeth II, with whom he'd had ""significant tensions."" (Chris Jackson/Getty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation)Harry said the committee unfairly nixed his security request without hearing from him personally and didn’t disclose the panel’s composition, which he later learned included royal family staff. He said Edward Young, the assistant private secretary to the late Queen Elizabeth II, shouldn’t have been on the committee because of ""significant tensions"" between the two men.The Home Office has argued that any tensions between Harry and the royal household staff were irrelevant and that the committee was entitled to its decision, because he had relinquished his role as a working member of the family.Representatives for the Sussexes did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.Lee Sansum, who once served as Princess Diana’s bodyguard, said Harry should be allowed to hire his personal security to protect him while he and his family are in the U.K.""Harry has been in the military,"" Sansum previously explained to Fox News Digital. ""He’s got a good understanding of security. I imagine he’s pretty switched onto all [the dangers]. But if he wasn’t, I would suggest he does.

NPR,'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree' goes to No. 1 — after 65 years,2023-12-05 16:10:00,Anastasia Tsioulcas,"""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" was written by Johnny Marks — who, as part of a long, great tradition of American Christmas songwriters, was himself actually Jewish. (Marks also wrote ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""A Holly Jolly Christmas."") Lee recorded the song when she was just 13 years old, not long after she signed a contract with Decca Records. Since its 1958 debut, this Yuletide classic has become a staple on holiday playlists. It's a sunny, up-tempo, broadly secular song, perfect for providing cheerful ambience. But there are a few more specific reasons it's been able to reach the top spot this year. Back in 2018, Billboard reconfigured its chart calculation formula, giving more weight to streams (and especially to streams made on subscription or paid-tier services). That meant that catalog recordings — whether released a year earlier or decades ago — would have more of a chance to chart alongside new material, since listeners are likely to stream old favorites over and over again. That effect has been especially notable during the holiday season, when artists have generally refrained from dropping big new releases — and when more listeners turn to a shared body of communally well-loved songs. Those chart changes had an impact on the holiday music landscape right away. In December 2018, Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" went to No. 6 on the Hot 100 — the highest position it had ever reached on the singles chart. (When it debuted in 1994, Columbia Records didn't bother to release the song as a commercial single in any physical format, so due to the chart rules of the time, it wasn't eligible.) Since then, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" has become the perennial star atop the Hot 100 each holiday season. It went to No. 1 for the first time in 2019, and continued that streak for the next three years. (Just behind it: one ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,"" peaking annually at No. 2 between 2019 and 2022. Before this past decade, ""Rockin' "" had peaked at No. 14 on the Hot 100 — in 1960.) This year, to mark the 65th anniversary of ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,"" Lee, who turns 79 next week, has made an extra-big push to help it climb all the way up the chart — past Mariah Carey. She recorded the song's first official video, which features cameo appearances by Tanya Tucker and Trisha Yearwood and has become a hit on TikTok, garnering 8 million views and counting. Trailing Lee on the Hot 100 this week is Carey, followed by Jack Harlow's ""Lovin On Me"" and two other deep-catalog holiday classics: Bobby Helms' recording of ""Jingle Bell Rock"" and Wham!'s ""Last Christmas."" But with the top spot to herself, Brenda Lee has finally received her holiday wish.",2733,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1217387261/brenda-lee-rockin-around-the-christmas-tree-billboard-number-one,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,top calculation reason chart long landscape hot change catalog specific single due contract generally body decade communally mariah lee notable carey weight time secular alongside ambience streak jewish lovin service song star million view bobby release decca reconfigured eligible wish trisha garner format jack big tucker mark brenda year ago peaked effect december video rock jingle high favorite write music physical official yuletide commercial back counting songwriter position annually johnny appearance cheerful broadly great yearwood stream bother cameo reindeer anniversary sunny season provide bell tiktok rudolph american debut christmas past trail impact finally receive listener tradition holly playlist especially helm turn give rockin record drop push part away climb jolly classic peak follow billboard subscription continued perfect atop material earlier perennial rule reach tree hit wham staple sign recording chance harlow formula meant refrain columbia make feature holiday spot week share artist,0.98575,0.0,6.502144112478032,0.4430093344155844,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Rural mail carriers warned not to blame mail delays on Amazon,2023-12-05 15:04:00,Caroline O'Donovan,"Mail carriers in a rural Minnesota post office overwhelmed by Amazon packages say they’ve been warned not to use the word “Amazon,” including when customers ask why the mail is delayed.“We are not to mention the word ‘Amazon’ to anyone,” said a mail carrier who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their job.“If asked, they’re to be referred to as ‘Delivery Partners’ or ‘Distributors,’ ” said a second carrier. “It’s ridiculous.”The directive, passed down Monday morning from U.S. Postal Service management, comes three weeks after mail carriers in the northern Minnesota town staged a symbolic strike outside the post office, protesting the heavy workloads and long hours caused by the sudden arrival of thousands of Amazon packages.On Tuesday, staffers from the offices of Democratic Minnesota senators Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar hosted a “listening session” with Bemidji residents to “discuss ongoing postal issues related to package and mail delivery,” according to an invitation distributed by Bemidji Mayor Jorge Prince.“We need a very clear commitment that we’re not going to be prioritizing Amazon packages over regular mail,” Sen. Klobuchar told The Post after Tuesday’s meeting. She also said her office is looking into improving postal staffing and pay for rural carriers, and has repeatedly requested a meeting with the Postmaster General.In addition to being banned from saying “Amazon,” postal workers have also been told their jobs could be at risk if they speak publicly about post office issues. Staffers were told they could attend Tuesday’s meeting only on their 30-minute lunch break if they changed out of uniform, mail carriers said. One mail carrier said he’d been warned there could be “consequences” for those who showed up.Postal customers in Bemidji have been complaining about late and missing mail since the beginning of November, when the contract for delivering Amazon packages in town switched from UPS to the post office. Mail carriers told The Washington Post last month that they were instructed to deliver packages before the mail, leaving residents waiting for tax rebates, credit card statements, medical documents and checks.Many of those residents complained to elected officials, including Smith, who wrote a letter to the postmaster general inquiring about reports that “Amazon is interfering with timely deliveries and stretching the agency’s already-overburdened workers too thin.”“We routinely work with the US Postal Service to deliver for customers and we apologize for any delays experienced in and around Bemidji,” Amazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson said in a statement. “We work closely with USPS to refine volume forecasts so they can operate smoothly, and we’ll continue to do so as we work through the holiday season.”(Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Interim CEO Patty Stonesifer sits on Amazon’s board.)As the holiday shopping season gets underway, the packages in Bemidji continue to pile up — at one point they were stacked so high someone called the fire marshal. Mail carriers say they’ve been mandated to work on Sundays, delivering mail seven days a week on lonely rural routes that can now take up to 12 hours to complete.“People need to understand how just how bad it’s gotten,” said Eric Cerroni, whose wife is a mail carrier in Bemidji.Mail carriers asked Cerroni to present written testimony on behalf of postal workers at the Tuesday meeting because they are “too busy with work and probably scared of repercussions.”Kyle Sorbe, a spokesperson for Sen. Smith’s office, said in an email that “if these reports are true, they’re extremely concerning and Senator Smith will be seeking a clarification from the Postal Service.”Post office spokesperson David Partenheimer said the meeting was “not a USPS-sponsored event and we don’t plan to attend,” as staff members “are focused on our peak-season operations now.”“Regarding questions about Amazon or other companies we work with,” he continued, “the Postal Service does not discuss specifics of our working relationships.”Tuesday’s meeting in Bemidji lasted over an hour. Fifty people attended in person, and more than 180 watched a live stream on the website of local newspaper the Bemidji Pioneer.Multiple postal workers who recently quit or retired due to the ongoing issues attended, including one identified herself only as Shelly, and received a spontaneous round of applause when she began to speak.“I worked at the post office for 30 years,” she said. “Never in my life have I been treated so poorly. I go home at night crying.”“I didn’t want to retire yet,” she said. “But I was forced to retire.”Residents expressed their problems with delayed mail, including missing medications and late bills resulting in fees. They also shared concerns about working conditions for postal workers, including low pay, long hours and safety risks for mail carriers working late at night.At the meeting, congressional staffers said multiple letters from their respective offices had finally received a response on Monday. In that response, shared with The Post, DeJoy acknowledged that the volume of Amazon packages at the Bemidji Post Office has increased. “Because packages in general take up considerably more physical space than letter mail or flats, a period of high package volume (such as peak season) can lead to Post Office loading docks becoming overwhelmed,” the letter says. “Thus, a high package volume always has the potential to interfere with the flow of letter mail, regardless of where those packages originated.” The post office is working to integrate the mail and packages, the letter said.DeJoy contested the assertion that rural carriers are underpaid, but conceded that because “package volume grew in Bemidji ... some rural carriers are now working longer hours than they were previously.”He also said that district-level data show that most of the mail in Bemidji is being delivered on time. But Smith’s office disputed that claim, saying the post office has limited ability to track paper mail.On Monday, the Minnesota senators introduced a bill called the Postal Delivery Accountability Act, which would require the post office to improve tracking and reporting of delayed and undelivered mail nationally.“As an essential public service, USPS owes its customers transparency,” a brief on the proposed legislation says. “This is a step toward that goal.”",6423,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/05/amazon-postal-service-delay-minnesota/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,partenheimer interfere anonymity town round staff timely increase medical uniform change specific ongoing forecast hour contract website home worker time underpaid dispute sudden route lonely fee data minnesota scar switch smith issue refer refine pay claim mention public load question volume democratic high spoke introduce fifty accord founder rebate force office month report miss ceo medication rural statement concern live regard shopping bill sits owes risk mayor northern season probably person period integrate carrier stretch receive finally warn assertion agency protest ups pile dejoy workload plan require poorly company mandate peak tax general underway clarification arrival day continued word limited result spokesperson busy delayed inquire kyle usps point track testimony distributor ability show holiday grow stag share clear customer wait directive job extremely postal strike considerably ban propose long accountability klobuchar response due sam begin leave safety marshal improve commitment stonesifer night goal monday session routinely elect email dock shelly meeting bemidji board jorge service discus late undelivered stephenson interim pass space resident thousand operation symbolic document break event respective attend instruct retire told year experienced publicly treat congressional consequence letter amy step prioritize focus write essential regular physical official lunch card heavy low local stack contest overwhelmed condition identify seek life recently david listen flow applause problem potential continue behalf tina include stream bezos closely eric multiple jeff fire transparency sorbe acknowledge mail paper deliver cerroni reporting lead morning package watch invitation credit repeatedly delivery patty member protect apologize spontaneous present complain concede smoothly understand post related management legislation express delay newspaper november sunday senator quit longer call postmaster request distribute washington partner addition staffer speak operate amazon work wife host tuesday week flat act,0.48945,0.1401214385801027,10.2204,0.4049489154636214,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,White House condemns protests at Jewish-owned Philadelphia restaurant,2023-12-05 15:02:00,Tim Carman,"Two days after pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of Philadelphia to demand a “complete end to the siege on Gaza,” politicians, Jewish organizations and others continued to condemn demonstrators for targeting a popular falafel shop co-owned by a James Beard Award-winning chef who was born in Israel.Organized by the Philadelphia Free Palestine Coalition, the Sunday demonstration saw hundreds of people gathered outside Goldie Falafel on Sansom Street, near Rittenhouse Square, claiming the shop’s owners were supporting genocide in Gaza. In videos posted to X, formerly Twitter, protesters can be heard chanting, “Goldie, Goldie, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide.”The coalition did not respond to a message sent to its Facebook page, but media reports indicate the group may have targeted the small chain because its owners, Israeli American chefs Michael Solomonov and Steve Cook, raised more than $100,000 during a single day in October for United Hatzalah, a nonprofit emergency medical response group. The organization, which relies on a network of volunteers, provides food, supplies, evacuation flights, training and psychological help in Israel and other areas around the world, treating Israeli and Palestinian victims alike.Solomonov and Cook are two of the most prominent restaurateurs in Philadelphia. Their company, CookNSolo, oversees a portfolio of restaurants, both casual and full-service, that includes Goldie, Dizengoff, Laser Wolf and Zahav, the latter of which was named the outstanding restaurant in America at the 2019 James Beard Awards. Solomonov has publicly said that he shifted his focus as a cook to Israeli cuisine after the death of his brother, David, who was killed on Yom Kippur while on duty with the Israel Defense Forces in 2003. After the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which left at least 1,200 dead and led to the capture of dozens of hostages, United Hatzalah announced a program to provide medical supplies and training to the IDF.Through a spokeswoman, the CookNSolo founders declined to comment on the Sunday protests. Others however spoke out publicly, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who has, according to the Jewish Times of Israel, “long woven his Jewish identity into his politics.” Shapiro held a news conference on Monday to condemn the targeting of Goldie.“This was beyond peacefully protesting some policy difference in the Middle East,” the governor said. “The purposeful gathering of a mob outside of a restaurant simply because it is owned by a Jewish person, well, that’s antisemitism, plain and simple.”Other politicians, from Pennsylvania and beyond, echoed Shapiro’s comments, including the Philadelphia mayor, a U.S. senator and representatives and even those inside the White House. During his campaign for the White House in 2019 and 2020, President Biden established his headquarters in Philadelphia, just a few blocks from a location of Goldie. It was apparently a staff favorite.“It is antisemitic and completely unjustifiable to target restaurants that serve Israeli food over disagreements with Israeli policy, as Governor Shapiro has underlined,” said White House spokesperson Andrew Bates in a statement forwarded to The Washington Post.“This behavior reveals the kind of cruel and senseless double standard that is a calling card of antisemitism,” Bates continued. “President Biden has fought against the evil of antisemitism his entire life, including by launching the first national strategy to counter this hate in American history. He will always stand up firmly against these sorts of undignified actions.”CookNSolo restaurants, among others in Philadelphia, have been targeted by the Philadelphia Free Palestine Coalition since October. On its Facebook page, the coalition called for a boycott of Goldie, Dizengoff, Zahav, Laser Wolf and other “Zionist” businesses in Philadelphia for taking part of “an ongoing colonial campaign of stealing, appropriating and profiting off of Palestinian food and culture as a means of erasing Palestinian existence.”In a statement on its Instagram page on Monday, the coalition said it “has been protesting, and will continue to protest, Israel’s decades long violent colonization of Palestine, the most recent manifestation of which is the ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”Nearly 16,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 40,000 wounded in Gaza since war broke out on Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian health minister. Most of the dead, according to reports, are civilians, not members of Hamas. Hundreds more Palestinians have died since fighting resumed on Friday following a seven-day humanitarian cease-fire to free hostages.Though Solomonov is not speaking to the media about the protests, he has addressed the issue in the recent past. Last month at a Jewish Community Center event in Philadelphia, he expressed support for Palestine’s rights to self-determination and to have its own state, according to a report in the Philadelphia Inquirer. But he said protests of Israeli food businesses are misdirected.“I think if you’re trying to find reason or verbiage to invalidate Israel, or the right to Jews to have a homeland … you’ll literally use whatever you have, and an easy way to do that is to say that all the food is all stolen,” Solomonov told the audience, according to the Inquirer’s report. The chef added that, “without a question or a doubt, part of Israeli food is Palestinian influenced,” but he suggested that “saying that Israeli food is stolen from Palestinians, is just another way of saying that the land is stolen, that they don’t have a right to be there.”Even as politicians rebuke protesters for their actions, including forceful statements from U.S. Sen. John Fetterman and Pennsylvania state senator Nikil Saval, Islamic civil liberties organizations are pointing out an apparent double standard in some public comments, or lack of them.",5956,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/12/05/palestine-protest-philadelphia-goldie-falafel/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,apparent dead cuisine civilian staff reason medical born national single doubt double ongoing coalition time charge group influence liberty hamas decline kippur award evil representative islamic raise hide issue restaurateur hostage oversees forceful claim rittenhouse fight free public nonprofit andrew training josh action question outstanding broke undignified popular difference palestine purposeful fought spoke capture news saval white page lack governor psychological accord protester founder force audience report month shapiro announce spokeswoman statement nikil area strategy chef easy street casual plain serve woven unjustifiable comment condemn mayor manifestation provide history demonstration x address violent person target campaign past hate restaurant protest pennsylvania senseless demand beard culture medium shift disagreement company small philadelphia jew entire health follow cooknsolo mob complete evacuation cook world location fetterman day continued spokesperson business standard point james chant counter simply inquirer behavior completely identity emergency policy forward palestinian dozen invalidate apparently shop sort long underlined solomonov indicate response suggest stand genocide firmly attack decade latter verbiage community monday respond zahav united laser jewish volunteer gaza appropriate find resume relies antisemitic event humanitarian brother twitter organization duty goldie state told inside network publicly treat friday program sansom video america focus flight instagram peacefully kind house israel card gov east support october conference headquarters owner chain michael victim recent bates formerly democrat life profit david center dizengoff colonization continue block john include facebook gather literally death homeland american hatzalah middle square food steal minister yom falafel lead rebuke supply land gathering left boycott biden member held establish reveals message part launch steve post defense demonstrator zionist express hundred sunday siege senator kill call cruel politician prominent colonial wound erase israeli civil washington add echoed heard speak wolf antisemitism portfolio president,-0.98515,0.1007387508394895,11.100426320667282,0.3540017211703958,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,"Henry Kissinger died, and this book came to life",2023-12-05 15:02:00,Sophia Nguyen,"The day Henry Kissinger died, the socialist magazine Jacobin didn’t waste a moment. It started selling a book years in the making: “The Good Die Young,” which assesses Kissinger’s legacy around the globe.Jacobin founding editor Bhaskar Sunkara said in a phone interview Friday that it was always the plan to “hold the book at least until he was dead, as a marketing gimmick.”“I wish I had a grander idea,” Sunkara laughed. “But basically it was just: Kissinger is important as a figure. We want to use him to explore wider dynamics of U.S. foreign policy.”Published in partnership with Verso Books, the essay collection includes contributions from scholars, journalists and activists examining Kissinger’s role in countries such as Angola and East Timor. The framing of the book may seem “personal,” Sunkara allows, but, “intellectually, we tried to avoid making it excessively one-dimensional or moralistic about Kissinger himself,” instead putting him in a broader context.“The actual content will be pretty — not bloodless, because obviously we have a real clear political perspective,” Sunkara said. “But we think that the partisan or far left or socialist left relies on a certain level of intellectual and academic seriousness, where maybe our counterparts on the right will deliver something much more polemical or unreliable. So I think the content is quite, quite good.”The collection strikes a blackly comic but erudite tone, opening with an introduction by Yale professor Greg Grandin that explores how Kissinger’s intellectual and professional trajectory unfolded across presidential administrations and in parallel with American power at large. “We all live now in the Kissingerian void,” Grandin writes. “What horrors await?” The book also includes an interview with historian Carolyn Eisenberg, in which she discusses how documents from the time — including transcripts of phone calls and public speeches — shaped her understanding of Kissinger’s efforts to sell the Vietnam War to the public. (She also disputes the view that Kissinger changed the paradigm of American foreign policy, criticizing his “habit of dressing up unoriginal ideas to sound like a new conceptual framework.”)The idea for the project got planted in late 2015 — before, Sunkara notes, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) viral moment during a debate with former secretary of state Hillary Clinton made a younger generation much more conscious of Kissinger. He and the book’s other co-editors, René Rojas and Jonah Walters, solicited contributions throughout 2016, and Verso’s editorial board approved the manuscript that fall. Other than a revision to the cover image, “the thing was basically locked,” said Sunkara, and he finalized a print run of 4,500 in fall 2019.Or so he thought: On Thursday morning, Sunkara learned that those copies had never been printed. But this had a serendipitous upside of allowing them to swap in Grandin’s updated introduction — which now refers to the Trump administration in the past tense, rather than the present — in the print and digital editions. They began printing on Thursday afternoon.Jacobin and Verso got the book’s sales listing online at around 11 p.m. the day of Kissinger’s death. By 8 a.m. the next morning, Jacobin had sold 3,000 books directly through its website — a hefty figure for a publisher of its size, making a limited print run. As of Tuesday afternoon, Sunkara estimates that between Verso and Jacobin, they have sold at least 7,500 copies.It’s difficult to imagine another figure eliciting that kind of response, Sunkara said, or anyone else filling Kissinger’s very particular shoes as celebrity diplomat: Over his lifetime, he drew a unique mix of admiration and animosity. Donald H. Rumsfeld might inspire similar feelings as Kissinger on the left, for example, but it’d be hard to imagine him ever serving in a Democratic administration. Statesmen of the “Colin Powell type” may have Kissinger’s bipartisan appeal, Sunkara said, “but also are just less involved as agents of history.”",4035,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/12/05/kissinger-book-verso-jacobin/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,moralistic marketing dead yale online finalize grandin conscious change transcript trump website appeal contribution found effort bhaskar time hillary phone collection timor dispute colin publish jacobin legacy lifetime blackly view comic editor book grander kissingerian afternoon await wider publisher public sell hard erudite run henry listing democratic habit rené greg rojas revision project parallel refers note drew frame country angola opening approve explore celebrity live academic political waste serve print feeling history scholar serendipitous carolyn role thursday professor past solicit actual tense particular presidential swap dynamic plan instead rumsfeld excessively sander professional manuscript unreliable editorial partisan upside day limited diplomat perspective counterpart large real broader elicit bernie eisenberg involve intellectual make ass dress criticize former debate examine clear shoe intellectually imagine printing digital agent policy strike tone copy update response introduction begin mix conceptual similar paradigm essay journalist directly administration board start size plant discus late avoid wish relies partnership important image bloodless document difficult type year state cover friday content void secretary seriousness bipartisan kind shape basically personal pretty lock hold donald fall east walter fill trajectory generation polemical include sound socialist interview idea sunkara death american deliver animosity morning clinton viral left vietnam edition unique laugh unfolded learn present unoriginal hefty jonah figure powell horror power magazine explores level understand verso activist admiration writes statesman call inspire moment young historian put kissinger estimate foreign speech tuesday,-0.3762,0.1486988847583643,9.562868318122554,0.3583299512987012,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,‘Eileen’: Thomasin McKenzie takes a walk on the wild side,2023-12-05 14:49:00,Michael O'Sullivan,"Of Ottessa Moshfegh’s debut novel, “Eileen” — the 1964-set story of a mousy prison secretary outside Boston who discovers her darker self — reviewer Patrick Anderson wrote in The Washington Post that the 2015 book “may bore some readers and repulse others, but those with a yen for the perverse may well embrace its unsettling pleasures and exceptional writing.” Substitute “viewers” for “readers,” and “acting” for “writing,” and you’ll have a pretty accurate assessment of the new film adaptation, the sophomore feature from director William Oldroyd (“Lady Macbeth”), working from a script by Moshfegh and Luke Goebel.In the title role, Thomasin McKenzie is never less than watchable. The 23-year-old New Zealand actress (who first made a splash, at 18, in “Leave No Trace” before moving on to such high-profile films as “Jojo Rabbit” and “Last Night in Soho”) still looks 13, but here she’s like the 13-year-old you want to keep an eye on when she’s behind your back. When we first meet the character, Eileen is sitting in a car surreptitiously watching a couple make out in a nearby vehicle. As Eileen gets worked up herself, she opens the door, scoops up a handful of snow and shoves it down the front of her conservatively tailored skirt. It’s an arresting if overheated metaphor for repressed desire, one that’s underscored when Eileen subsequently drives home in a car she must operate with the windows cracked — even in the dead of a New England winter — because otherwise the passenger compartment fills with smoke.Back at the prison for teenage boys where Eileen works, she fantasizes about being ravished by a young guard (Owen Teague), appropriately named Randy. The way she looks at an inmate, Lee Polk (Sam Nivola), a boy who stabbed his father to death, is also more than slightly alarming. Eileen harbors her own thoughts of killing her father (Shea Whigham), a psychologically abusive, alcoholic former chief of police and widower, whose only engagement with Eileen — other than to berate her — is to ungraciously receive the fresh cigarettes and booze she picks up every day for him on the way home from work.It’s a depressing routine. But it’s all about to change.That change is precipitated by the arrival of a new prison psychologist: Anne Hathaway’s Dr. Miss Rebecca St. John, as the glamorous, Harvard-trained therapist is floridly introduced to the gobsmacked staff. Soon, Rebecca has befriended Eileen, who starts bathing more regularly and wearing lipstick. A relationship is about to bloom, in which Rebecca sees (and nurtures) something in Eileen that others do not. But what to call it? Friendship? Love? Obsession? Manipulation? All of the above? It’s the central dynamic of “Eileen,” and it will take the main character — and us — to startling places.As with “Lady Macbeth,” Oldroyd displays an affinity for female characters who defy societal expectations. (That’s putting it mildly, in the 2016 film and in this one. Taboo and transgression abound.)But the unorthodox, as pleasurable as it can be, is weak sauce. Despite “Eileen’s” bravura central performance — make that performances; Hathaway is great, too — the overstepping of boundaries feels slight.At the center of it all, however, is McKenzie, embodying a weirdo in normie’s clothing (hand-me-downs from Eileen’s dead mother, which gradually go from drab to fab). One of the insults Eileen’s father casually deploys compares life to the movies — like this one, as it happens: In films, he tells her, there are the characters who make moves, the ones we can’t take our eyes off of. Then there are the characters, like Eileen, who just “fill in space.” At first glance, it seems like Rebecca is the one making the moves.But Dad is dead wrong about his daughter, it turns out. And Rebecca is, early on, the only one who notices. “You really think you’re a normal person?” she asks her new protégée.No, Eileen’s not normal. Not by a long shot. And McKenzie doesn’t just fill in space, she activates the whole darn movie, ultimately wrestling it away from Hathaway’s Rebecca, who enters the film like a whirlwind but is ultimately as surprised by Eileen’s depths — harboring deep reservoirs of resentment and long-stewing, suppressed fury — as we are. When Rebecca comments on the anger she senses after an interview with Lee’s mother (Marin Ireland, also good in a small but pivotal role), Eileen tells the shrink, with a shrug, “Everyone’s kind of angry here. It’s Massachusetts.”It’s a funny line, in a film that is by turns darkly comic and disturbing, both sensations brought into vivid, caustic relief by the film’s mesmerizing star.",4626,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/12/05/eileen-movie-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dead ungraciously staff normal change zealand teenage script central father home winter perverse vehicle rebecca weirdo couple fantasizes anderson reviewer scoop lipstick deep star comic bathing title book polk oldroyd randy bravura shrug harbor love transgression yen trace character mckenzie luke daughter booze passenger societal window introduce sophomore subsequently ravish despite shove berate miss england ultimately resentment boston routine front marin moshfegh accurate weak depress lady underscored alarm comment guard cigarette darn funny actress shea role person embrace mousy precipitate nivola receive compartment rabbit glamorous anger befriend turn mesmerize suppress dynamic notice darker away surprised fury soho small wrestling whirlwind activates day arrival anne nearby mildly watchable expectation ireland teague pick adaptation friendship darkly alcoholic repulse desire engagement insult director skirt make appropriately patrick former feel obsession glance drive arrest widower long dad clothing sam disturb nurture leave psychologically abusive lee discovers night normie tailor startle relationship handful start vivid embody metaphor wrong pivotal display manipulation pleasurable prison crack space movie sensation william thomasin macbeth ottessa affinity assessment exceptional move wear shrink gobsmacked whigham secretary splash write inmate overstep kind boy back eye snow jojo pretty surreptitiously bloom psychologist fill gradually asks performance life shot reader conservatively therapist defy center line eileen great early mother john pleasure deploys compare interview female open overheat sauce film death fresh debut repress brought regularly abound car drab angry watch floridly boundary stabbed slightly owen meet relief chief post hathaway substitute fab depth reservoir story kill unsettle bore call sens casually young caustic put washington taboo viewer enters operate unorthodox work feature police act,-0.9775,0.3242542153047989,6.877466251298024,0.4898471898471896,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,What choir is this? D.C. meets the Washington Douglass Chorale.,2023-12-05 14:24:00,Michael Andor Brodeur,"More choruses should make an entrance like the Washington Douglass Chorale.As evening settled in on Sunday, the 47 choristers filed two-by-two down the center aisle of National United Methodist Church reverently toting little battery-powered candles and singing the plainsong hymn “Of the Father’s Love Begotten,” accompanied by Julie Huang Tucker on the church’s mighty organ.It was a fittingly ceremonial start to the inaugural concert of this new semiprofessional chorus, launched this year by former Choral Arts Society of Washington director Scott Tucker and producer, composer and music director Nolan Williams Jr. It was also a standing-room-only affair, with more than 700 tickets sold and attendees hugging their own coats to make room.As co-artistic directors, the two men have made it the WDC’s explicit mission to “celebrate the rich tapestry of musical styles that stem from both Black and White traditions.” On Sunday, they also made it their mission to celebrate the season with “Noel! A Glorious Mystery,” a program of holiday hymns, choral deep cuts, festive contemporary experiments and attention-seizing fresh arrangements of old favorites.“If you didn’t come here in the holiday spirit, you’ll leave in the holiday spirit” host Allison Seymour said at the outset. “You might even buy a tree on the way home.”The program opened with a churchwide singalong of composer and organist Evelyn Simpson Curenton’s arrangement of “O Come, All Ye Faithful,” which put the sublime half-diminished seventh made famous by David Willcocks to chill-inducing use, and concluded with a stirring bespoke coda.Pipes properly cleared, the chorus then moved straight into Daniel Pinkham’s 1957 “Christmas Cantata (Sinfonia Sacra).” Accompanied by a small brass ensemble, they beautifully handled the softly sustained “Alleluia” of its opening movement, the veil of soprano and alto voices in its central “Adagio,” and the sprightly and celebratory “Allegro” finish.Baritones Daniel Smith and Darrick Speller were highlights of the show’s second chapter, which paired Margaret Bonds’s “Could He Have Been an Ethiope?” (with its unexpected harmonic destinations) and Peter Cornelius’s “The Three Kings.” Speller’s welcoming warble was especially suited to the narrative role of the lyric.The intricacies of Francis Poulenc’s “O Magnum Mysterium” offered a demonstration of how finely tuned this young chorus is. A lushly layered “Ave Maria” from the early-20th-century Black composer Nathaniel Dett was radiantly realized by the chorus and splendidly decorated by tenor Devin Mercer.The penultimate portion of the program opened with Renaissance composer Jan Pieters Sweelinck’s perennially popular motet, “Hodie Christus Natus Est,” but this austere a cappella gave way to a showcase of alluring contemporary arrangements. A muted trumpet cracked the door for a sleek and cosmopolitan “Silent Night” arranged by Williams Jr., narrated by Aaron Myers and gracefully sung by bass David Breen, who strung its melody like a strand of lights over slowly unfurling jazz-hued harmonies.The soprano Jouelle Roberson was the jewel of an energizing suite that recast “O Holy Night” in progressively richer and more robust settings, reaching a gospel-infused climax that had my fellow listeners swaying in the pews. Williams Jr.’s smart and shadowy arrangement of “What Child Is This?” offered soprano Michelle Maxwell a forum for her buoyant, vibrant vocalizations, and the chorus a chance to sound supremely slick. A final “Glory to God!” section landed with Mark Butler’s arrangement of “Glory, Hallelujah to the Newborn King,” mightily led by tenor Wayne Jennings and concluding in a toe-curling hail of praise. And a finale of a Williams Jr. arrangement of “Gloria!” (i.e., “Angels We Have Heard on High”) with blazing performances from tenors Michael McKeon and Jonathon Hampton.It wasn’t a perfect performance — the balances were here and there a bit off and unruly, which could have had as much to do with the venue or the microphones onstage as the inexperience of the chorus itself. Also, next time, someone needs to remember to disengage the snare drum, which caught some resonant and thus rattling frequencies at inopportune times.But in a town nearly drowned in choral talent, the WDC immediately shows a special spark — a fearless mix of old and new, classical and not, expected and un-, performed with skill to match its vivacity.

Washington Post,A creative program called AimHire is helping people find jobs,2023-12-05 13:57:00,John Kelly,"For the want of a phone, the job was lost. For the want of a job, the house was lost. For the want of a house, the person was lost. And that, in a nutshell, is what AimHire works to prevent.AimHire is a workforce development program from Friendship Place, a District nonprofit that’s a partner in The Washington Post Helping Hand. It’s no surprise that many people who are homeless are also jobless. Sometimes, the impediments preventing them from finding a job aren’t what you would expect.“A lot of people don’t need new skills,” said Richard McKey, assistant director of AimHire. “They need a job with their existing skills, and they need a job as soon as possible.”Participants who come to AimHire’s U Street NW offices get a quick orientation to the program.“It’s an extremely brief intake process, intentionally so,” McKey said. “It’s slimmed down and fast.”Participants sign some forms that outline what the program’s expectations are: applying for five jobs a week and checking in with AimHire weekly. Then it’s right into preparing for the job hunt.“We focus on addressing soft-skills barriers,” said McKey.That includes assistance crafting a résumé, engaging in mock job interviews and providing much-needed encouragement.“Many participants have been through the wringer,” McKey said. “Their self-confidence and self-image is low.”They may be experiencing homelessness, recovering from addiction or dealing with mental health issues. The AimHire staff and volunteers work to boost their self-esteem.Sometimes, though, what’s really needed is a smartphone.“If they don't have a phone, they can't get a job,” McKey said.Job applicants need to be able to look for jobs on their phones. They need to be able to immediately answer texts and emails from potential employers. And once they get a job, they need to access the phone apps many companies use for scheduling and payroll.That’s why AimHire gives phones to participants who don’t have one. They’ll pay a person’s phone bill, too.Occasionally, that’s the last McKey will see of that person — “but not as often as you’d expect,” he said. “The idea is that you trust that the participant has the best understanding of their needs, probably better than you do. If you trust them, they repay that trust.”It’s also vital that participants get up to speed with technology.“There’s a digital divide,” McKey said. “Many participants can do construction work, security, janitorial, but they can’t use email. They just can’t do it.”A common problem: Job offers get lost in an unchecked spam filter.AimHire schools participants in email and trains them to use such sites as Indeed and CareerBuilder.AimHire will pay for things besides phones, too.“If their car broke down, and they can’t get to the interview, I can order them an Uber — and have done many times,” McKey said.Some participants have come to the program having completed training for a commercial driver’s license but unable to afford the $200 cost of actually getting the CDL.AimHire paid for it.Similarly, many restaurant workers are required to have their own work outfit: black pants, a chef’s coat and slip-proof shoes. AimHire will provide those — “and pretty much whatever they need to get a job,” McKey said.In the last year, 204 AimHire participants found work, McKey said. The average time to job placement was 60 days. The average wage was $18 an hour.One of the successful participants was Curtis Robinson. Twice in the last few years the 44-year-old Washingtonian has experienced homelessness. He was staying at a men’s shelter in Southeast D.C. when he heard of Friendship Place and AimHire.“They basically saved my life,” Robinson said.He’s loved cooking since he was a boy.“The average 10-year-old kid wants to go outside and play on a Saturday afternoon. Well not this kid,” Robinson told me. “I used to watch all the great chefs on PBS: Jacques Pépin, Martin Yan, Julia Child.”AimHire helped Robinson apply for jobs. It bought minutes for his phone. It bought him work clothes.Since March 2022, Robinson has worked preparing food in a dining hall at George Washington University. He found a home in Petworth.“They sure have changed my life,” he said of Friendship Place and AimHire. “I couldn't be more thankful for them.”",4255,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/05/aimhire-helping-hand/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,deal staff change found homelessness march lose worker craft time unable phone shelter george coat average mckey indeed skill saturday julia minute orientation successful security intake issue afternoon mock divide kid pay nonprofit love training martin broke stay pépin lot development southeast cost exist license quick commercial hall recover office wage train slimmed repay save common chef street bill order provide employer probably address person robinson afford prepare experience restaurant give require cooking pb wringer company health complete participant day home outline expectation workforce janitorial washingtonian friendship form offer curtis unchecked director shoe digital assistance extremely job assistant jobless answer mental yan schedule résumé boost email process immediately volunteer vital find apps bought driver barrier year told hand experienced engage program placement focus weekly construction house addiction paid basically pretty expect black thankful outfit trust surprise life problem prevent great potential uber include place applicant interview idea aimhire access nw food richard nutshell site pant speed car watch apply jacques intentionally understand homeless post impediment check spam sign school washington partner text heard work play week university district,0.98615,0.2115158636897767,7.130079817559864,0.4504718614718614,0,2023-12-05
CNN,Hackers access profiles of nearly 7 million 23andMe customers,2023-12-05 13:30:00,Sean Lyngaas,"A hacker or hackers have accessed nearly seven million profiles of 23andMe customers, a spokesperson for the genetic testing firm told CNN on Tuesday, including in some cases users’ ancestry reports, zip codes and birth years.A Friday filing from 23andMe to the Securities and Exchange Commission said that about 0.1% of the company’s user accounts, or roughly 14,000, had their accounts breached by the hackers.23andMe is standing by that number but is also now telling reporters that the hackers were able to access some 5.5 million profiles that use a company feature called DNA Relatives that allows users to find genetic relatives. In addition, the hackers accessed a subset of family tree information on 1.4 million DNA Relatives profiles, the 23andMe spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Engadget, a tech news outlet, first reported on the wider impact of the hack.It’s the latest hack to affect a major US corporation that has impacted far more people than initial news reports suggested. Last month, identity management firm Okta admitted that hackers had stolen data on all users in Okta’s customer support system, after initially reporting in September that less than 1% of more than 18,000 were affected.In the case of 23andMe, the hackers reused old usernames and passwords from other websites to break into 23andMe customer accounts — a rudimentary but effective technique called credential stuffing.The 23andMe spokesperson, who declined to be named, did not respond to questions about who carried out the hack.“23andMe has completed its investigation, assisted by third-party forensics experts. We are in the process of notifying affected customers, as required by law,” a statement posted Saturday evening to the company’s website says. “We have taken steps to further protect customer data, including requiring all existing customers to reset their password and requiring two-step verification for all new and existing customers.”",1953,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/tech/hackers-access-7-million-23andme-profiles/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230627142321-sean-lyngaas-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,customer law account expert suggest usernames stand case relative website respond saturday email decline profile reset firm process test data security initial effective million family late affected technique reuse filing find wider break told cnn question affect system friday step news exist carry genetic report month support major statement okta zip roughly verification information notify breach hacker investigation ancestry include access reporter birth code user dna subset steal impact reporting admit protect require september number outlet rudimentary company exchange post password complete management tech spokesperson commission hack initially tree corporation call forensics credential addition assist feature tuesday identity,0.80055,0.0,12.252082111436952,0.4210606060606061,0,2023-12-05
CNN,Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes explain ‘We lost the jobs we love because we love each other’,2023-12-05 13:01:00,Lisa Respers France,"T.J. Holmes and Amy Robach may have lost their jobs as “GMA3” anchors, but it sounds like they believe it was worth it for their “beautiful relationship.”The pair are “ready to share the real story behind the headlines” on their new iHeartRadio podcast, “Amy and T.J.” The first episode debuted Tuesday.Holmes and Robach made headlines a year ago after photos sparked speculation that the journalists were engaged in a romantic relationship while legally married to others.ABC News president Kim Godwin called the matter an “internal and external distraction” at the time and they were pulled from their morning show “GMA3” before eventually parting ways with the network.In the first episode of their podcast, Holmes said they were “the folks who lost the jobs we love because we love each other.”And while Robach described their past year as “hell,” she added that “In the end, all of us are always rooting for love.”“It doesn’t always happen when you want it to happen,” she said. “And it’s undeniable when it’s real and it’s something you have to navigate and it’s not easy.”Robach was previously married to “Melrose Place” star Andrew Shue and Holmes was married to attorney Marilee Fiebig.The former co-anchors denied they had cheated on their former spouses, stating they were both “in the middle of divorces” when the photos of them together first surfaced.“We shouldn’t have allowed, I can say that in hindsight, for folks to find out about our relationship before they found out about our divorces,” Holmes said. “If people would have heard earlier that ‘they’re in a relationship, now they’re dating,’ maybe an eyebrow would have been raised or something, but it wouldn’t have become what it became.”Holmes, who formerly worked for CNN, went on to say he and Robach “screwed up.” She said they were merely trying to protect their children and families by not initially going public with their romance.Their new podcast was announced in November.

Chicago Tribune,Berwyn mainstay Vesecky’s Bakery closing after more than a century of serving up Eastern European goods,2023-12-05 11:59:00,Shanzeh Ahmad,"The Berwyn mainstay known as Vesecky’s Bakery is closing after more than a century of serving up Eastern European baked goods the old-fashioned way.The bakery at 6634 Cermak Road officially announced the closure on Facebook Monday morning. The post said Tuesday would be the bakery’s last day.“We are so grateful to all of you for your support throughout the many years,” the post said.By 9 a.m. Tuesday, owner Nancy Vesecky said the bakery was sold out. Customers had started lining up at 5 a.m., with the bakery opening at 6 a.m., and lines were “out the door,” Vesecky said.Vesecky and her husband, David Vesecky, took over the family business from his parents in the early ’90s, she said. Vesecky herself is Polish, so she said marrying into the family and taking over the bakery was a good fit.As the couple reached “retirement age,” Vesecky said they thought it was a good time to close the bakery.“We want to do some traveling. We want to spend more time with the family and our grandchildren, just get to enjoy life a bit,” Vesecky said. “I tell everybody I haven’t been out on a Friday night in over 30 years.”The bakery first addressed the closure on Facebook in October in a post that said in part, “The rumors are true. We have decided to say goodbye to a significant chapter in our lives and retire.”While retirement brings new excitement, the moment is still met with mixed emotions for Vesecky.“It’s very bittersweet,” she said. “It’s been really hard saying goodbye. Everybody’s been so kind. It’s been a wonderful time here.”Popular specialties found at the bakery over the years included a fruit-filled pastry called a kolacky, a sweet raisin nut bread known as houska — a personal favorite of Vesecky’s — and the rye bread. For years customers anticipated the bakery’s traditional St. Nicholas cookies at Christmastime. On Fat Tuesday, the start of Lent, customers would line up to get their hands on massive orders of paczki.“We’re thinking of selling our recipes,” Vesecky said. “People want us to make a cookbook. We’re still deciding on that. You have to remember when we make things, we’re making it in pounds, quarts, gallons. We’ll make a couple hundred kolacky at a time. Everything has to be broken down.”The fourth-generation bakery first opened in Chicago in 1905, according to a post online by the village of Oak Park, and has been in the Vesecky family ever since. While the bakery held its mainly Czechoslovakian identity through the test of time, the menu had adapted to change, like offering a variety of Mexican cookies and seasonal pastries featuring guava to appeal to the area’s growing Latino population.The family bakery moved from Chicago to Berwyn in the 1920s and soon became a habit for customers who were willing to wait in long lines for the breads, cakes, pastries and pies. A customer once told the Tribune that she waited three hours for her baked goods and said, “You can’t go home empty-handed.”sahmad@chicagotribune.com",2972,https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/ct-food-veseckys-bakery-berwyn-closing-20231205-3n6orktdsjfeteq7ikfcetorni-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/1Ho4-p74gjIAeVWadn_i_-w92NA=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/LFHW4FS36FDDLAHEN3GRTXMINY.JPG,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,customer adapt wait online century long change hour appeal found brings home time tribune night cookbook monday christmastime oak couple parent start guava test kolacky eastern rumor polish cooky family husband nut seasonal specialty bakery latino remember marry area sell traditional year told hand menu hard massive popular friday retirement park move age habit favorite goodbye kind grateful bread personal rye accord recipe pastry road berwyn village raisin support pie opening october owner announce decide closure cermak life quart line david fat early close order significant serve include facebook variety open bit pound address czechoslovakian bake lent excitement european mexican gallon morning closing chapter enjoy chicago broken cake mainstay officially houska held sweet part emotion post anticipate grandchild sahmad identity travel business hundred bittersweet reach nancy call spend moment mixed offering make vesecky feature nicholas grow tuesday wonderful,0.98485,0.1009421265141319,6.984796084828712,0.5153796024763768,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,The overhead bins are empty. Why do airlines make you check your bag?,2023-12-05 11:37:00,Andrea Sachs,"On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, Camila Tellez was first in line with her boarding group at the airport in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The college student had one carry-on bag that fit American Airlines’ size dimensions. She approached the counter to scan her pass when the gate agent told her she would have to check her bag because the overhead bins on the plane were full.But they weren’t.“I start walking to the back and I kid you not, there are fully empty overhead bins. There must have been 10 to 15 of them,” said Tellez, who was flying to Boston via Dallas. “They were completely, completely empty.”Airlines are very clear about their carry-on bag policies. Passengers can bring onboard one personal bag and one carry-on of a certain size. But even when travelers follow the rules, airline employees sometimes require them to surrender their bags for what can appear to be dubious claims of unavailable overhead space.“I scroll through the social media exchanges of the major airlines with passengers pretty much every day, and the two most common complaints that I see are damaged bags and overhead bins with plenty of space when passengers have been asked to check their bags anyway,” said Gary Leff, founder of the View from the Wing blog.Evidence abounds on social media, where aggrieved travelers share photos of lightly occupied or completely barren bins. So we asked aviation experts and the airlines: What gives with the empty bin space?Airlines want to leave on time. One delayed flight can cause a chain reaction that leads to even more disruptions.Carriers typically allow 30 minutes to an hour for boarding, depending on the aircraft, airport and destination. To stay on schedule, the gate agents will try to anticipate — and preemptively eliminate — any speed bumps.“Those delays of a few minutes matter because it can be the difference between some passengers making their connections and not. It can mean delaying the next flight. It also usually means planes aren’t as clean, because they don’t spend time removing trash from the plane to try to get back on schedule,” Leff said. “They’re really trying to get the plane out to keep its schedule, and not having to deal with carry-on bags is a key way of doing that.”In a perfect world, everyone’s luggage would effortlessly slide into the overhead space. But that’s not always the case.Luggage is not uniform. Some travelers ignore size limits or stick their personal items and coats in the overhead compartment instead of by their feet. Others place their roller bags horizontally instead of wheels out. The one exception to the latter guideline: Smaller planes with shallow bins, which require all passengers with rollaboards to gate-check their bags.Traffic jams can form in the aisles as passengers puzzle out the possibilities until flight attendants swoop in with the solution. If all else fails, the passenger will have to march their bag to the jet bridge for a gate check. All of this puts pressure on the ticking clock.“Ideally there should be enough overhead bin space for every passenger to store one carry-on bag. That’s why we’re seeing airlines invest in new, larger overhead bins,” said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and the president of the Atmosphere Research Group. “But this will rely on everyone doing their part. Overhead bin space is finite.”Several factors have contributed to a surge in carry-on bags. In 2008, some major airlines started charging for checked baggage. The original $15 fee has since doubled or more. (Southwest, which allows free checked items, is the exception.) Also, planes are jamming more people into cabins by adding extra rows without necessarily expanding overhead space.Gate agents are in charge of keeping the boarding process on track. A plane’s late departure can earn them a demerit, said a Delta Air Lines flight attendant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for professional reasons.“They’re the only department that gets penalized for that. It’s mark on their record, and if you get however many, you can get fired,” the flight attendant said. “So they’re under a lot of pressure.”As the eyes inside the aircraft, the flight attendants will send updates about the overhead space to the gate agents. When making their calculations, the flight attendants will factor in the bags already stowed and en route, as well as the style of luggage, since some types consume more space than others. As the number of open spots starts to dwindle, the gate agents — with the flight attendants’ blessing or independently — will decide to cut off all carry-on bags.“If it’s a really chaotic boarding for the gate agents, they may assume it’s really chaotic for us on the plane, so then they use their best guess to when to start checking if they don’t hear from us,” the Delta flight attendant said.For gate-checked bags, the gate agent will tag your bag, and you will either roll it to the end of the jet bridge or load it onto a cart. Depending on the aircraft and airport, you will either retrieve your bag on the jet bridge at your next stop or at the baggage carousel in your final destination (unless you have to go through customs).American Airlines, which replied by email to questions about empty compartments, said its staff uses its best judgment when determining bags-to-bin space. However, the carrier acknowledged that sometimes its estimation is slightly off. Delta said by email that it switches from voluntary to mandatory bag-checking once the flight attendants have alerted the gate agents to diminishing space.Harteveldt said airlines’ intentions are virtuous — they are trying to avoid delays — but their tactics are imperfect. “No one wants to check bags when it’s not necessary, and no one wants to be lied to, either,” he said.Later boarding groups often feel the brunt of this practice. For Delta passengers, this could mean the second half of the four divisions. For her American Airlines flight, Tellez was in Group 7 (out of nine) when the agent informed the remaining passengers they would have to check their bags. I was in Group 6 when an American Airlines agent made a similar announcement on a flight from Knoxville, Tenn., to D.C. The agent told us that the 90-seater plane could only accommodate 25 bags, despite several empty compartments.“The gate agents get a threshold of how many bags they are supposed to allow on before they start checking,” the flight attendant explained. ” You think, ‘Oh, 25 bags. There’s more than 25 overhead bins.’ The problem is that people don’t listen [to the carry-on rules].”Obviously, travelers who board early will have ample space for their bags. But to get that priority, passengers must pay for it or earn it through credit card memberships or loyalty status.If you qualify for any of the earlier boarding groups, such as military or families with young children, take advantage of them. Try to be the first in your group, but don’t try to pass yourself off for a higher number. That is akin to cutting the cafeteria line on pizza day. Also, avoid basic economy, which kicks you to the back of the queue.Leff said to be aware of the size and bulk of your bag. Make sure it is the correct dimension, including the wheels and handle. Don’t overstuff your bag. You might be able to avoid scrutiny by carrying an unobtrusive or squishy bag, such as a duffel or backpack.The Delta flight attendant said carry-on bags are more often checked on routes with heavy weekend and business travelers, and during busy travel periods, such as holidays and summer. So choose your flight times and connections wisely.“I started noticing it more right before the summertime, but it doesn’t happen much in the slower traveling season,” they said.Some people ignore the directive to gate-check their carry-on and head straight for the plane to look for an open spot. Or they may retrieve their bag from the jet bridge after noticing a cubby hole for their bag.“If you see one or two spaces open and your bag is still sitting on the bridge and the ramp hasn’t been taken in yet, just talk with a flight attendant,” the flight attendant said.Once your bag is settled in, hand over the gate-check tag to a flight crew member, so they can adjust the weight and balance tally.",8261,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/12/05/airline-gate-check-overhead-bins-luggage/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,deal calculation anonymity staff uniform style wheel double bulk destination hour child march explain time aggrieve charge coat group custom happen minute cabin route membership fee employee southwest item luis family view brunt traveler switch cubby shallow damage adjust factor kid settle pay claim free remove lie load question atmosphere henry stay mexico aisle difference lot jet dallas high gate spoke passenger reaction intention abounds guideline despite founder demerit onboard tick stick hear roller boston attendant major ideally common slow bring suppose imperfect approach balance scroll exception airline luggage roll season send priority wing qualify military period carrier foot stop tellez college compartment surge give necessarily record notice leff airport require instead medium number scan limit fails kick talk small exchange professional follow tally slide crew world matter travel day surrender perfect expand advantage business fully rule busy retrieve delayed baggage carousel mandatory spend track chaotic department counter form invest reply hole large economy rely akin half connection ignore occupy jamming make pizza eliminate holiday depend ample san completely share clear practice feel agent directive policy penalize harteveldt overhead threshold expert update empty swoop leave thanksgiving similar schedule latter checked weight original judgment industry accommodate lightly email process board start size choose photo earn tag late avoid unavailable dimension estimation plane space departure key guess announcement knoxville research duffel trash possibility mark determine walk type told hand inside diminish blessing bag flight gary potosi weekend fly fit complaint clean personal card back eye heavy rollaboards pretty basic store carry dubious cart ramp aviation bridge chain final condition decide preemptively summertime independently jam air cut line listen problem early analyst loyalty include place stow horizontally virtuous open solution fire row dwindle american acknowledge remain plenty cafeteria scrutiny social speed contribute lead camila credit correct slightly member student part summer alert handle anticipate assume check unobtrusive aircraft straight aware division earlier delay sunday boarding typically delta consume head young overstuff squishy put extra effortlessly add inform voluntary tactic pressure puzzle president spot,0.96065,0.0,8.159187192118221,0.4236903107086592,1,2023-12-05

""The Duke and Duchess can be Mr. and Mrs. like the rest of us.""""My aim is simple: if someone doesn’t want to be royal, that is a decision we respect – but they should not keep the titles and privileges if they trash an institution that plays an important part in our nation’s life.""Omid Scobie's new book, ""Endgame,"" has reignited questions about alleged racism within the British royal family.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America,"" Scobie said it was two royals who raised questions about Archie’s skin tone, but U.K. laws prevented him from revealing their names in his book.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERAuthor Omid Scobie has been described as a ""mouthpiece"" for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex by the British press.

The book was pulled from shelves in Holland on Tuesday, Fox News Digital confirmed.This isn’t the first time Seely has been adamant about having the couple’s royal titles stripped. Following the couple’s release of their six-part Netflix docuseries in late 2022, Seely announced he would be introducing his bill. He argued that Harry, in particular, was attacking important British institutions ""as well as trashing his family and monetizing his misery for public consumption.""Jonathan Sacerdoti, a British broadcaster and royal commentator, told Fox News Digital that Seely believed the pair ""are embarrassing themselves.""Bob Seely's proposal first came to light following the release of Netflix's six-part docuseries ""Harry & Meghan.""

""He was clear that his actions were about supporting a constitutional monarchy, which has been brought into disrepute. He felt that if Harry had any self-respect, he would renounce his title. The monarchy is meant to be dignified. It’s the dignified bit of our constitution.""According to Sacerdoti, Seely told him earlier this year that if Harry hated being a royal so much he should ""do us all a favor"" and renounce his title, noting, ""We’ll call you Mr. and Mrs. Windsor or whatever you want to be called.""""Bob Seely initially proposed a change to the law to enable their titles to be removed around a year ago,"" Sacerdoti explained.

""That is why he adopted the name Windsor. He also created a mechanism that allowed German holders of British royal titles and peerages to be deprived of those honors. It was used first in 1919 to deprive three German princes and one Austrian of the British titles they had. These were George’s first cousins and an uncle by marriage.""Seely's amendment would give the Privy Council, made up of 741 senior parliamentarians, the power to strip the Sussexes of their titles. He argues that if the duke continues to trash the royal family, he should set an example and give up his title, but if he does not, the law should enable it to be removed anyway. Seely says that the duke's criticism of the royal family is equivalent to attacking ‘important institutions in this country.’""Sacerdoti noted that Seely’s determination was fueled by Scobie’s book.Omid Scobie previously co-wrote the book ""Finding Freedom"" about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

In 2020, they stepped back as senior royals and moved to California. At the time, they alleged that palace officials were insensitive to Markle’s mental health struggles as she attempted to navigate royal life. The couple also claimed that the duchess faced racist attitudes from the U.K. press, which contributed to their decision to leave the country.In 2021, the couple sat down for a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey.

CNN,What is the feast of the seven fishes?,2023-12-05 10:45:00,not specified,"Whether you’re Italian, Italian American or simply love a seafood spread, cooking up a feast of seven fishes makes for a very special Christmas Eve. In households with roots in the tradition, it’s almost always a family affair, with generations of cooks in the kitchen and favorite foods that return year after year. But anyone can host their own festive seafood feast, and you don’t have to stick to traditional recipes, either.Here, everything you need to know about the feast of seven fishes, including its history and some of our favorite fish recipes.The Feast of the Seven Fishes is an Italian American Christmas Eve celebration that operates similarly to Thanksgiving, with traditional dishes and practices that span generations, decades and oceans. Known in Italy as La Viglia, which translates to The Eve, as in December 24 or Christmas Eve, The Feast of the Seven Fishes isn’t a religious celebration. Instead, think of it as a big, festive, fish-forward meal. There isn’t a set menu but there are a few dishes most families include, and we’ve got lots of info here that will help you plan a Feast of the Seven Fishes that fits your preferences — and the size of your kitchen.Why do Italian Americans celebrate Christmas Eve with a feast like no other? A confluence of factors led to this tradition.Firstly, there’s the history of Italy itself. Prior to 1861, the geographic area that’s now Italy was a group of regions, each with its own government. Due to its long coastlines, seafood featured prominently in the cuisines of what we now call southern Italy.Unfortunately, before and after the unification, southern Italians were also poorer than their northern neighbors, and millions immigrated to the U.S. and other parts of the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, bringing their food traditions with them. This connection to Southern Italian foodways is why some historians believe Italian Americans honor Christmas Eve with fish-forward meals.Others note that many Roman Catholics, including those of southern Italian descent, don’t eat meat on Fridays or the eve of some holidays. Additionally, the number seven has Biblical significance: there are seven sacraments and deadly sins in Catholicism.The strictest adherents to the seven-fishes tradition will tell you that indeed there should be seven fish on the dinner table; others say that any and all seafood, including shellfish, count toward the final fish tally. The key to committing to cook seven different kinds of seafood is spreading out the dishes throughout the meal; instead of preparing seven whole fish for what would be an excessively large main course spread, offer perhaps three small appetizers, a soup, pasta, then entrée plus a side salad, each with seafood as the focus.Buying the fish:• Buy the freshest seafood possible from a reputable fish monger. Order what you need a week in advance because it’s a busy time of the year.Menu planning:• It’s okay to serve small “tasting-size” portions of each dish. With this in mind, assume each recipe you make will serve 1 1/2 times as many people as it says: a recipe for 4 will serve 6; a recipe for 6 will serve 9; a recipe for 8 will serve 12.• Plan for two or three courses to be cold or room temperature: there aren’t enough burners on the stove for seven.• You don’t need a ton of side dishes; many of the fish dishes have one built in.Setting up for the feast• Consider how many plates you own: we love serving each dish as a separate course, but only when we have enough dishes to carry it off. Three dishes served on one plate is fine.• Decorations are traditionally Christmas-inspired, given that this feast is thrown on Christmas Eve.There’s no one “right” way to celebrate it, every Italian American does it slightly differently, but this is a good place to start.

CNN,Sean Astin is fine with a ‘nepo baby’ label,2023-12-05 10:27:00,Marianne Garvey,"Actor Sean Astin acknowledges a little nepotism may have helped him get his start in Hollywood, and he’s ok with that.Astin, who has appeared in nearly 200 television shows and films, including starring roles in “The Goonies,” “Rudy” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, grew up in Hollywood as the son of actors John Astin and Patty Duke.“Life is hard, work is hard. Finding your way in the world is hard. So when people have some good fortune, I don’t begrudge that,” Astin said.“I don’t begrudge myself having been born into a family where I was given a lot,” Astin added. “I also feel that that comes with a lot of responsibility that you have the opportunity to embrace or not.”“So yeah … you know … nailed it,” he joked about being a “nepo baby.”In 1985, Astin landed the lead in “The Goonies,” and often attends fan conventions with panels for the movie and the “LOTR” franchise.“I’ve spent many weekends a year going to places where people give me feedback, how important those films are to them and how much they mean,” he said of his interactions. “I’m grateful, I’m always grateful.”Now 52, Astin’s latest project is the dystopian movie, “The Shift.”“I’m at a stage in my life where I realize and this is what the movie does, it shows you that for every choice you make, your life is totally different,” Astin said. “Hopefully, people will be carried along the journey of this post-apocalyptic experience. And then when it gives itself, (it) creates a hopeful message.”",1480,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/entertainment/sean-astin-goonies-lord-of-the-rings/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220406114659-marianne-garvey.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,feel opportunity fortune born rudy stage lotr start hopeful star family late dystopian goony choice movie find panel important convention spent year hard ring lord lot begrudge weekend project grateful carry life joked trilogy different john include place acknowledges nail film feedback role embrace television hollywood realize responsibility lead experience journey creates land patty give astin actor message nepo world attends nepotism totally interaction add work make show grow,0.95155,0.4054054054054054,4.6211695906432695,0.54375,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,"‘Welcome Home, Stranger’: A tempestuous novel with a perfect ending",2023-12-05 10:23:00,Ron Charles,"If you’re facing a painful trip home this month, resist stocking up on wine and Candy Cane Joe-Joe’s. Instead, tuck a copy of Kate Christensen’s tempestuous new novel in your suitcase. There’s a good chance your own travails will pale next to those faced in “Welcome Home, Stranger.” And if not, at least Christensen will serve as a wise captain to guide you through the family storm.Of course, novels about going home are as common as flight delays. And a certain degree of rigor mortis has crept into the plot of relatives gathering in the wake of a death. But Christensen’s narrator charges into that worn storyline with refreshing candor.“My mother died two days ago. Or was it three,” Rachel says at the opening of “Welcome Home, Stranger.” “My sense of time has been wonky ever since I got back from the Arctic.”Studying climate change at the top of the world might seem like a good excuse for not calling much or visiting more often, but when Rachel’s sister, Celeste, picks her up at the airport in Portland, Maine, the weather inside the Mercedes SUV is already freezing with a chance of avalanches. “She doesn’t have to say a word,” Rachel thinks. “My antennae are as hyperattuned to my sister’s frequency as hers are to mine.” Celeste cared for their late mother by herself through a long, horrible illness. “She’s upset that I didn’t come home sooner,” Rachel thinks. Indeed. Rachel’s been AWOL for the last 10 years. The sisters ride home in a thick amalgamation of sibling love and resentment.Welcome home, reader, to a deeply endearing story about confronting one’s past and constructing a new future — under extreme duress. Rachel may be a Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer, but she’s got no ego about her status. “I look and feel exactly like what I am,” she says with her typical fondness for taxidermic efficiency: “a middle-aged childless recently orphaned menopausal workaholic journalist.” And that’s the sugarcoated version; she’s also a divorced woman living with her ex-husband and his boyfriend. Her life is a kitchen drawer of sharp objects and sticky problems that she doesn’t want to deal with. “Coming back to Maine is complicated,” she admits.If Christensen didn’t have such a clever sense of humor, the situation she throws her narrator into — returning to help spread Mom’s ashes — could feel intolerably dreary. But everything about this initial homecoming has been designed to prick Rachel with comic humiliation. In stark contrast to Rachel’s discombobulated home life, Celeste lives in a Portland mansion with her trust fund husband and their shiny twins “with SAT tutors and language coaches, SSRIs and antidepressants and Ritalin, special meals tailored to their many allergies and intolerances.”Well, at least Rachel isn’t bitter.The first night back, Celeste invites Rachel’s old boyfriend over for dinner. With his lovely new wife. And he immediately turns the knife: “It’s still you, Rachel,” he tells her in the foyer. “But I couldn’t wait forever, and I figured you’d never be back.”“Try the cheese!” Celeste shrieks.“This is my family,” Rachel thinks, as she regrets her decision to stop drinking. “It’s not easy to come back here, not easy to find my place again, like a book I abandoned midway through and lost the thread of.” More perplexing is the looming influence of the woman who’s not even there anymore. Somehow, death has only exaggerated the presence of her “criminally neglectful mentally ill mother.”Mom’s past offenses accrue slowly in painful memories and revealing dialogue. Conversations that Rachel and Celeste have avoided for years start to turn like the rusty gears of an old engine — sometimes with explosive results. Robbed of the helpful distraction of her work, Rachel must finally start to reconsider the “cruel, drunk, wayward, beautiful, intelligent, crazy” woman who raised her and eventually sent her running away. It’s a deft and honest record of how a damaged person can acknowledge that her mother was a monster while also coming to appreciate “her idiosyncratic dignity, her preening flamboyance, her dogged zest to experience life to the fullest.”The success of this novel, Christensen’s eighth, rests wholly on her ability to create the artful illusion of ricocheting events — sudden swerves of grief, chance encounters that spiral toward disaster and a series of setbacks that pile up Job-like at the worst possible time. “Welcome Home, Stranger” could have been merely a satisfying, somber story about coming to terms with family trauma, but Christensen doesn’t let Rachel just wallow in old resentments. Even as we learn more about the toxic influence of Mom’s “jealous narcissism,” Rachel finds the remaining buttresses of her life knocked away until she’s got essentially nothing left but her own determination. In the end, her scientific knowledge and analytical acumen are of no use in trying to understand her own spirit. She’ll need other skills she’s long ignored.The result is a heartening story about a 53-year-old single woman in a dying industry who feels invisible and adrift. “The only power I have right now,” she says, “is in moving on, adapting, and surmounting my own sudden irrelevance. I’m still alive.”As it turns out, that inspiring proclamation — just halfway through the novel — is woefully premature. But “Welcome Home, Stranger” finally arrives at the most lovely ending of a novel I’ve read all year.Ron Charles reviews books and writes the Book Club newsletter for The Washington Post.By Kate Christensen",5520,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/12/05/welcome-home-stranger-book-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,adrift stranger deal portland allergy wise change single hearten suv anymore relative home lose time sticky invite essentially knife fondness charge mercedes degree complicate intolerably influence kate skill indeed suitcase rest sudden memory situation ricochet foyer shiny honest excuse swerve family husband comic damage wayward drawer fund science crept raise scientific book mansion pale ride taxidermic tuck love helpful ago cheese object drunk run typical throw stark wholly travail zest deeply design term childless spiral month trip opening resentment common midway buttress weather language easy setback drinking reconsider serve prick efficiency newsletter distraction rusty climate resist woefully person review workaholic homecoming forever return past appreciate stop tempestuous finally explosive experience conversation twin gear antidepressant turn pile record rigor instead airport jealous wonky captain lovely away read mentally wake endear world day word regret result study dreary cane narcissism dignity future tutor pick duress boyfriend sister trauma preen disaster coach engine ability ritalin illness feel spread kitchen wait adapt top version charles sat reveal copy knock living long intelligent neglectful status painful avalanche pulitzer determination mom club divorce night tailor irrelevance candy industry satisfy deft course discombobulate immediately hyperattuned start analytical initial late awol possible humor narrator upset avoid idiosyncratic success beautiful frequency find arrives stock writer event christensen offense series ash surmount year plot acumen amalgamation inside loom robbed flamboyance proclamation sooner move halfway flight wine back accrue crazy woman perplex artful special spirit wallow refresh trust life reader recently welcome presence celeste exaggerated problem worn mother criminally eighth place abandon ego humiliation encounter orphan thick dialogue death acknowledge remain freeze slowly guide antenna mortis gathering extreme left monster eventually clever confront create meal rachel learn figure sugarcoat knowledge thread sibling grief power understand construct dinner sharp story delay writes call horrible cruel inspire toxic illusion ssri premature chance somber washington menopausal visit invisible storyline work wife contrast decision,-0.7597499999999999,0.2173913043478261,7.561998215878678,0.5707370464586957,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Bake shrimp under a blanket of garlicky breadcrumbs for a quick meal,2023-12-05 10:00:00,Ann Maloney,"As fall ebbs and winter looms, the days may grow chilly and a little gloomy, but there is so much to celebrate: first Diwali and Thanksgiving, and now Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa.If you live on the east coast of the United States, it’s also a time to rejoice in the end of hurricane season, which runs June 1 to Nov. 30. True, most hurricanes get swirling in August and September, but as I flip my calendar to December, I breathe a little sigh of relief, and I often pull out “Cooking Up a Storm.”Get the recipe: Garlic Shrimp BakeThe cookbook was first published in 2008, three years after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Mississippi Gulf Coast and a collapse of the levees caused devastating floods in New Orleans, my hometown and where I was living at the time.It is a collection of recipes, of course, but the book also contains life-affirming tales about how people reached out and helped one another in a time of crisis. “Cooking Up a Storm” grew out of a regular column in the Times-Picayune newspaper that focused on helping New Orleanians recover recipes lost to the floodwaters.This fast, easy recipe for shrimp baked under a blanket of breadcrumbs, parmesan and herbs was contributed by Kelly Hamilton, a history professor, who ran culinary tours in the French Quarter. Her home flooded to the rafters, and volunteers from Oregon — so many kind people descended on the city to help — gutted the water-soaked structure. When their friends and neighbors in the Western state heard Hamilton had lost her cookbooks, they began sending her volumes to rebuild her collection. This recipe was one of her favorites from the bunch.It’s also one that a dear friend from New Orleans makes again and again for her family.The generosity and heartwarming stories that fill the pages of “Cooking Up a Storm,” which was lovingly written by food writers and former Times-Picayune columnists Marcelle Bienvenu and Judy Walker, make it a natural one to pick up around the holidays when I am at risk of getting lost in marathon baking, travel planning and gift shopping.The stories it contains serve as a reminder that family, friends and neighbors are what matters, and even people we’ve never met can be compassionate, generous and giving. And, frankly, I’m sharing this recipe now because it is also a quick, delicious dinner idea to keep in your pocket during this hectic season.The recipe is a snap to make. A single layer of shrimp is topped with garlicky seasoned breadcrumbs, which protect the delicate crustaceans as they bake. (It’s important to use large shrimp; smaller ones require less cooking time and will dry out before your topping crisps and turns golden.)The dish smells great, too. You can eat it on its own or serve it with pasta, rice or a favorite grain, or on top of a salad.And remember: This little dish comes to you thanks to the generosity of strangers who cared.",2885,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/12/05/garlic-shrimp-bake/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,stranger top mississippi living swirl structure single begin smell dish thanksgiving garlic home lose time winter katrina kelly collection rice cookbook baking frankly descend gutted united course generous rejoice calendar publish ravage tour volunteer gloomy friend pocket ran family walker ebb collapse garlicky hurricane book snap levee remember fast important writer delicious year state bakethe volume loom run december rafter judy flip grain oregon focus city favorite write regular page bienvenu kind quick pasta parmesan recover hamilton recipe gift rebuild flood columnist planning chilly diwali fall east golden neighbor fill crisis column pull sigh live easy dry great generosity risk serve idea hanukkah season send history food professor breathe christmas gulf bake contribute topped storm turn august marathon give protect heartwarming culinary cooking shrimp september crustacean hometown require orleanians relief layer herb western delicate compassionate small contains blanket dear marcelle dinner matter natural travel day story newspaper reach crisp devastate june quarter pick large eat orleans breadcrumb heard lovingly celebrate french hectic make coast grow holiday former share reminder,0.99615,0.2079722703639514,8.593392539964473,0.5112520812520812,0,2023-12-05

Foxx received a standing ovation when he took the stage.“I’ve been through something. I’ve been through some things. You know, it’s crazy, I couldn’t do that six months ago. I couldn’t actually walk,” Foxx said, pausing as he became overwhelmed with emotion. “I’m not a clone, I’m not a clone.

I have a new respect for my art. I watched so many movies and listened to so many songs trying to have the time go by.

Fittingly, in a city that is home to some of the world’s most famous galleries, some of the stations are considered works of art in their own right.But the Paris Métro railway system, built in the 1900s and now carrying nearly four million passengers every day, is struggling to cope with the demands of modern commuting, its ageing facilities and infrastructure creaking under the city’s growing population.For many in Paris, particularly those living or working around its less fashionable outer suburbs, it’s a challenge to navigate across the city without having to route each journey through the central districts, adding travel time and worsening congestion.But change is coming – and on a huge scale. The venerable Paris Métro is about to get its most significant upgrade in decades with the arrival of the Grand Paris Express, a new 200-kilometer (120-mile) system that will add four lines and 68 brand-new stations to the network.These will mainly be connecting suburban towns without passing through the densely populated city of Paris – adding outer rings to an underground map of Paris that has, until now, been made of 14 lines that only reach out from the center like spokes.It’s been an epic undertaking. Construction of the lines, which began in 2016, is the biggest civilian infrastructure project in Europe, according to the French government. Inevitably, given the scale, it has been hit by delays.But that didn’t stop the city from showing some Parisian pzazz late last month as the first train for the new Métro lines was taken for a test drive, attracting crowds of invited onlookers to a railway depot in the suburb of Champigy-sur-Marne.The 108-meter-long six-car train, the first of its kind produced by Alstom for the Grand Paris Express, made its debut amid triumphal music and a light show of lasers in the French flag colors of white, blue and red.“To change people’s lives, we will have to change how they move,” French Transport Minister Clément Beaune said at the November 28 event, which saw the train make a successful two-kilometer test run along a section of line 15, one of the new routes.France hopes the Grand Paris Express will significantly cut transport time for suburb-to-suburb movement on public transit and reduce car usage for residents in the Greater Paris region.Unlike other Métro lines, it will use driverless trains to create a fully automatic rapid transport network, meaning there will be no need to hire and train new drivers, plus there will be greater resilience against disruptions from strikes.“We are on the right track for success,” Beaune laughed. “It will serve as a good example for cities across France.”Paris was among the world’s first cities to have a metro system. Its first line opened in 1900 as part of the city’s construction efforts to host the Olympic Games that same year. It expanded rapidly and extensively during the decades that followed.Prior to the opening of the Grand Paris Express, it had already evolved into a sprawling 800-kilometer mega system encompassing 16 central city metro lines and five Réseau Express Régional, or RER, commuter rail lines for the surrounding suburbs.The new project will introduce four new lines – 15, 16, 17 and 18 - plus extensions to existing lines 11 and 14.For many living in the city, the new routes can’t come quickly enough.“I love living in Versailles but sometimes it’s just a lot,” said Lauren Bain, 26, a journalist working in Paris but living in the city of Versailles, roughly 20 kilometers southwest of the capital.Bain says she attends church in the neighboring town of Saint Aubin, ostensibly a 20-minute drive away, but two hours by bus, which is how she currently makes the journey. It can take even longer; she was stuck on a bus half-submerged in water during heavy rainfall.She commutes to work in the center of Paris via the RER C line, which she has little love for despite the convenience of a station in Versailles.“That thing is terrible,” she said. “I arrive late at work all the time! Just earlier this week, my train was canceled for no reason.”Once the new Grand Paris Express line 18 opens, connecting Versailles directly to Saint Aubin, as well as Paris Orly Airport, the city’s second-busiest, her options are set to improve.“Line 18 cannot open sooner,” Bain said.Mohamed Mezghani, secretary general of the International Association of Public Transport, based in Brussels, says the new lines puts Paris at the forefront of city public transport networks – alongside Tokyo, Moscow and Washington D.C., looking to reduce environmental impact through suburban interconnectivity.“The Grand Paris Express, with its circular lines, encourages movement from suburb to suburb,” Mezghani said.“People in big cities are realizing that cars are not a solution, congestion keeps worsening and building more roads will only attract more traffic.“We need this updated version of public transportation.”One big question for many Parisians – and for visitors to the city – is whether the new network will be operational in time for the 2024 Olympic Games, which will mostly be staged around the French capital.This was the original plan when the project was announced by then President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009, long before the city won its Olympic bid. But numerous delays have stretched the timeline.A full opening of line 14 by now, plus partial opening of lines 15, 16, 17 and 18, which together connect to both Paris international airports, had been promised by Sarkozy and his successor François Hollande.However, the project has been hit by various setbacks during the years, including construction site floods, delays in equipment delivery, and perhaps most crucial of all, the Covid pandemic.And eight months before the 2024 Olympic Games, only the extension of line 14 to Orly Airport is expected to open in time. The other lines will gradually come on line starting in late 2025, according to the project’s official website.France’s Transport Ministry remains upbeat about the impact the new rail lines will have on Paris, insisting that network capacity will be increased by 15% in time for the Games, which are forecast to attract millions of visitors to the city, already a popular summer destination.“Our action plan is clear, and we’re on schedule,” it told CNN.Even behind schedule, the new lines are likely to enhance the French capital’s appeal.As writer Ernest Hemingway once remarked: “There are only two places in the world where we can live happy: at home and in Paris.” And once the new Grand Express lines open, hopefully the distance between them will shrink a little further.",6957,https://www.cnn.com/travel/paris-new-metro-network/index.html,https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/shutterstock-editorial-14234140ak.jpg?c=16x9,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,civilian kilometer town stuck increase briskly crucial built creak change triumphal europe forecast hour central home effort time invite blue alongside quickly terrible route gorgeous successful southwest ministry remains insist suburban françois particularly distance driverless big amid public love orly struggle railway set action question run system ring popular lot passenger white upbeat versailles happy music exist introduce operational game project forefront water epic accord metro despite flood nouveau month sarkozy train opening announce olympic live roughly paris setback association south street serve full successor art resilience remark clément connect stretch stop venerable impact réseau tokyo church demand give onlooker airport brussels plan extensively away evolve rail base ernest crowd general scale world environmental travel depot day arrival commute capital expand modern fully fittingly hit track meaning cope alstom parisian make convenience show grow stag clear beaune capacity drive version equipment soviet living long inevitably revolutionary transport sprawl update nicolas mega begin usage map bain decade schedule produce significantly original light journalist suburb movement laser directly circular underground start commuter test grand mezghani million congestion late populate lauren victory rer hemingway success movie international resident ostensibly consider writer event driver station year told hope navigate numerous network infrastructure tunnel sooner challenge age rapidly hire shrink move secretary facility city construction kind building official heavy fashionable carry expect undertaking road métro reduce neighbor color gradually huge life enhance passing cut center line government arrive promise extension moscow rapid flag encourages great transit significant include place solution open currently entrance disruption american debut rattle partial automatic option minister realize site car densely journey encompass delivery worsen create laugh surround part summer gallery famous outer express bus section earlier visitor delay november attends cancel reach longer bid saint inspire pzazz occasionally régional covid put washington add french attract work host upgrade aubin president week district,0.9959,0.0862440707201379,10.062826585179522,0.4721375737123768,0,2023-12-05
CNN,‘John Lennon: Murder Without a Trial’ doesn’t do the music icon justice,2023-12-05 09:00:00,Brian Lowry,"John Lennon created some of the most beautiful music ever recorded, and Mark David Chapman murdered him. That the latter receives the lion’s share of the time in the docuseries “John Lennon: Murder Without a Trial” speaks volumes about media culture, and how the popularity of true crime brings perpetrators the very notoriety that some of them seek.Granted, the title gives away the emphasis of this three-part presentation playing on Apple TV+. The project does seek to give Lennon his due, describing the former Beatle as “one of the most outspoken peace campaigners the world has ever seen,” which made the horror of his murder in 1980 even more shocking.Audio from a final interview with Lennon further drives home the sense of what was lost, as he talks about wanting to live and work a long time as he heads back into the studio, as well as being around for his young son, Sean.At its best the docuseries captures the immediate outpouring of grief that greeted reports of Lennon’s death, from fans gathering in front of the Dakota, Lennon and Yoko Ono’s home, to the “Monday Night Football” team debating off camera how – and indeed whether – they could cut into the game with the breaking-news announcement. (Howard Cosell, who expressed skepticism, ultimately delivered the word.)Still, the irony at work here is articulated by former New York prosecutor Kim Hogrefe, who makes a point during part three of referring to Chapman only as “the defendant” to avoid giving him any further publicity or the notoriety that he coveted. “It is incredibly unfortunate that he sought to bring that attention to himself by stealing the fame of someone like John Lennon,” Hogrefe says.After the introductory chapter, which features interviews with police and ER personnel swept up in the chaos surrounding the shooting, much of “Murder Without a Trial” focuses on Chapman’s motivations and mental health, including his initial intent to pursue an insanity defense. That discussion incorporates the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan three months later by John Hinckley Jr., who also employed that legal strategy, contributing to public skepticism at the time about its legitimacy.Part of the conversation turns to the emergence of conspiracy theories fueled by the lack of a trial, including the government’s interest in Lennon’s anti-war activities. That’s just additional fodder, though, for the more salacious side of the story where “Murder Without a Trial” most consistently operates.Narrated by Kiefer Sutherland, and directed by Nick Holt and Rob Coldstream, the docuseries opens by billing what will follow as “a journey into the mind of a murderer.” It also happens to make its debut along with the arrival of a new Beatles song, “Now and Then,” which features Lennon’s vocals.While how much insight the program provides into Chapman’s mental state this many years later is open to debate and interpretation, the fact that it goes into that while devoting less time to Lennon’s life and musical legacy perhaps says as much about us, both then and especially now, as it does any of the principals.“John Lennon: Murder Without a Trial” premieres December 6 on Apple TV+.

CNN,Kelsey Grammer BBC interview reportedly cut short as talk turned to his support of Donald Trump,2023-12-05 08:53:00,Jack Guy,"“Frasier” star Kelsey Grammer had an interview with the BBC cut short by Paramount+ representatives this week after the conversation turned to his support for former US President Donald Trump, according to a radio host.Justin Webb, one of the hosts of the “Today” program on BBC Radio 4, recalled that Grammer had mentioned actor and producer Roseanne Barr earlier in the interview, which aired Monday.Real-life Trump supporter Barr played fictional Trump-supporter Roseanne Conner in the successful reboot of the sitcom “Roseanne” in 2018. However, her show was later cancelled by network ABC following racist comments she posted on Twitter, now known as X. Barr later apologized and indicated she believed her behavior was influenced by the sleep aid Ambien.Turning to politics, Webb asked Grammer if he was still a supporter of the former US president.“I am,” Grammer said. “And I’ll let that be the end of it.”After the segment ended, Webb went on to discuss Grammer’s comment.“I have to say, actually, Kelsey Grammer himself was perfectly happy to go on talking about it,” Webb said.“The Paramount+ PR people, less happy that he talked about it at some length,” he said.“They decided that we’d had plenty of time for our interview. But I should stress that he was absolutely perfectly happy to talk about why he supports Donald Trump and still does in the coming election,” added Webb.CNN has contacted Paramount+ and Grammer’s representatives for comment.Grammer appeared on the BBC show to discuss the reboot of hit ’90s sitcom “Frasier” which was released by Paramount+ in October.The new chapter follows Frasier as he returns to Boston from Seattle “with new challenges to face, new relationships to forge and an old dream or two to finally fulfil,” according to a series description on Paramount’s website.Grammer plays the titular character, a pompous psychiatrist, who originally appeared in beloved 80s sitcom “Cheers” before getting a spin-off show of his own.The original “Frasier” went on to enjoy 11 years on the air and won a record 37 Emmys for a comedy series, becoming one of the most successful spin-offs in TV history.",2141,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/entertainment/kelsey-grammer-interview-donald-trump-scli-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205102232-kelsey-grammer-062021.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,barr supporter indicate forge trump segment time original influence relationship length contact pr successful sleep politics emmy frasier star discus stress believe absolutely release representative beloved dream mention series reboot twitter year comedy network character program challenge titular perfectly description happy accord conner donald support played boston decide originally recall roseanne fictional cheer election cut air bbc sitcom grammer today comment interview history kelsey aid paramount plenty return producer finally racist conversation chapter enjoy turn pompous record apologize actor abc talk psychiatrist tv follow post fulfil earlier cancel radio hit webb short add play show host behavior president former week seattle,0.98725,0.0,9.59221411192214,0.4975108225108224,0,2023-12-05
NPR,Ex-British officials say Murdoch tabloids hacked them to aid corporate agenda,2023-12-05 08:26:00,David Folkenflik,"Controlling owner Rupert Murdoch has publicly apologized. His larger media empire — which includes Fox News, the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal — has paid out more than a billion dollars in handling the claims and legal fees since 2011. Now, his British operations have paid again — this time to a former senior government official who says his voicemails were hacked not only for scandalous copy, but also as part of an effort to block the company's $15 billion takeover of a huge European broadcaster. Three former senior company executives figure prominently in the allegations, including the current chief of Murdoch's British operations, a top aide to French President Emmanuel Macron, and the incoming publisher of the Washington Post. ""It was corporate espionage,"" says the former Cabinet minister, Chris Huhne, who was forced to resign in 2012 after a series of personal scandals that followed what he alleges is the hacking of his phone by people on behalf of Murdoch's tabloids News of the World and The Sun. ""This is not about the tittle-tattle of celebrity hacking. This is about serious attempts to undermine the democratic process."" He said Murdoch's tabloids were hunting for ""kompromat"" - compromising material - to taint him, and found it. Huhne's attorneys and those for News UK, as Murdoch's British publishing arm is called, announced in court Tuesday that they have reached a settlement, said to be a ""substantial six-figures damages"" plus his full legal costs. Two other former Cabinet ministers, Vince Cable and Norman Lamb, have lawsuits that are currently scheduled to be tried in court in early 2025. In a statement to NPR issued minutes after the settlement became public, News UK rejected Huhne's allegations of a corporate agenda, pointing to the coverage of scandals about the politician that ensued in its tabloid's pages. ""It is strongly denied that there was any corporate motive or direction to obtain information unlawfully,"" the statement read. ""Huhne was a senior politician and stories published were legitimate and in the public interest."" In an earlier and more generic statement, the company cites its ""unreserved apology"" from 2011 and says it is paying financial damages to ""those with proper claims."" It calls this ""the tail end of litigation"" but says it is effectively saying enough to fresh claims, as ""all of these matters are historical, dating back to a period between 1996 and 2012."" The officials only say they found they were the subject of hacking in the past two years. Even so, News UK suggested some more settlements may be in the offing. Huhne's allegations echo legal challenges that have roiled the Murdoch empire on this side of the Atlantic, calling into question the judgment, integrity and involvement of the company's foremost figures. Earlier this year, Fox Corp. agreed to pay $787.5 million to settle a defamation suit filed by election technology company Dominion Voting Systems for repeated and baseless claims by Fox stars and guests that Dominion was involved in election fraud in 2020 to cheat then-President Donald Trump of victory. According to CNBC and the Washington Post, Murdoch last week gave testimony under oath behind closed doors in a similar blockbuster case. The voting tech company Smartmatic is suing for the even gaudier sum of $2.7 billion. Fox invokes a familiar defense of its statements broadcast about Smartmatic, saying the events being discussed on its shows were ""extremely newsworthy,"" as it did in the Dominion case. ""Smartmatic's damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on its face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms,"" a statement from a network spokesperson says. Privately, Fox executives and attorneys have noted the case involves a new judge and a new jurisdiction — a New York state court in Manhattan. ""It's all of a piece,"" Huhne says of the legal challenges to the Murdoch companies in both countries. ""This is a company that is out of control that is basically attempting to undermine the democratic process, and they need to be called out for it."" Rupert Murdoch stepped down last month from all formal roles in favor of his elder son, Lachlan. He still controls 43% of the voting shares, however. The drama driving so much of the hacking scandal in Britain back in 2010 and 2011 — and revived now — involves a broadcasting giant called Sky. The Murdochs controlled 39% of Sky. For years, the elder Murdoch had wanted to acquire full control. British critics questioned whether the deal would allow Murdoch, who already owned four major national newspapers and a top book publisher, to consolidate too strong a grip on the media market. Rupert Murdoch, shown in London in July 2011, sought for years to acquire full control of Sky. His British newspaper arm now faces allegations its tabloids hacked into Cabinet ministers' voice mails to pressure them to allow the deal to go through. Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images hide caption Rupert Murdoch, shown in London in July 2011, sought for years to acquire full control of Sky. His British newspaper arm now faces allegations its tabloids hacked into Cabinet ministers' voice mails to pressure them to allow the deal to go through. The government in power was led by Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, who had won the Murdochs' support, in a coalition with Liberal Democrats, known to be more skeptical. Cable was the business secretary, a Liberal Democrat who had what was called the ""quasi-judicial role"" of deciding whether to allow the Murdochs to acquire full control of Sky. (At the time, News UK was led as executive chairman by James Murdoch, Lachlan's younger brother. James has since left the company, taking issue with its editorial direction.) Cable referred it to regulators to weigh concentration of market power. But it was up to him whether to allow the acquisition to proceed. ""It was a major storm,"" Cable says. Taken together, the Huhne, Cable and Lamb suits suggest that senior News UK officials arranged for their voicemails to be hacked to learn of private, embarrassing and nationally sensitive information. That resulted in scandalous tabloid headlines that weakened the three. It also enabled the company to gain leverage over those in positions to oppose their takeover of Sky. ""If you're doing it just to settle commercial scores, that's worse than idly thinking, well, let's get a bit of nightclub gossip about Prince Harry or something of that sort,"" says David Hooper, one of Britain's most prominent media lawyers. ""I think the more you dig in, the worse the conduct will seem."" Lamb's allegation is most direct: he alleges that Frédéric Michel, then the top lobbyist for News Corp. in Europe, twice threatened to use the tabloids to attack the Liberal Democrats in the ruling coalition if its leaders did not support News UK's quest for Sky. Michel ""implied that if the decision surrounding the bid did not fall in their favour, it would be a pity if things were to change and they were no longer able to report in such a positive way,"" Lamb wrote in a witness statement to a later judicial inquiry. The message, he added, ""was very clear."" Cable's decision was supposed to be aloof from political pressure. His lawyers wrote in court documents that he received 262 calls from Murdoch journalists, the vast majority of which, they wrote, are presumed to be fishing for access to his voicemails. The judge overseeing the inquiry, Brian Leveson, termed Michel's efforts inappropriate, saying they were part of ""a sustained behind the scenes lobbying campaign by News Corp, in support of its bid wholly to own [Sky]."" Michel, now the communications director for French President Emmanuel Macron, did not reply to phone and text messages seeking comment. In Cable's case, he was taped by the Telegraph talking to two women whom he believed to be constituents in a private meeting at his office at which he said he had ""declared war"" on Murdoch; that video was leaked to the BBC, leading to a public rebuke. He was stripped of the power to adjudicate the Sky deal. In court documents, Cable's attorneys allege that video may have been obtained unlawfully by News UK executive Will Lewis and former Telegraph IT staffer Jim Robinson and given to the BBC. Lewis was previously the top editor of the Telegraph and he hired Robinson to join News UK shortly after the incident. (Lewis, who has been named to be the next publisher of The Washington Post, did not respond to a request for comment through the Post.) In addition, the Sun broke the news that Cable had had to pay a $500 fine for paying certain taxes late. The suit alleges that his accountant told him that information could only have come from tax authorities. In fact, he alleges, it was obtained unlawfully. Cable testified to Leveson's inquiry that his colleagues ""expressed some alarm about whether this whole affair was going to lead to retribution against the Liberal Democrats through [News Corp.'s] newspapers."" Cable, his lawsuit asserts, ""was targeted over an extended period for no purpose other than purely to sell more newspapers for [News Corp.] and or for [News Corp.] to exert political influence."" The bid was referred to a more Murdoch-friendly Cabinet minister, Jeremy Hunt. But News UK withdrew it when outrage hit a fever pitch in 2011 over revelations that the News of the World had hacked into a dead schoolgirl's voicemails. Though the company sought to renew its efforts for the buyout, it was effectively dead. The Murdochs reached a deal to spin off its stake in Sky to Comcast in 2018 as part of a huge sale of other entertainment properties to Disney. Huhne represents an even starker fall from grace. He says that News Corp. was ""out to get me"" because he had been a leading member of Parliament calling for a police investigation of the company as early as 2009 and for what became Leveson's judicial inquiry. News of the World broke the news of the ambitious politician's affair with an aide. He broke off his marriage. His former wife, Vicky Pryce, would exact her revenge, giving the scoop to a columnist for an upscale Murdoch paper, the Sunday Times of London. She publicly revealed that she had taken responsibility years earlier for a speeding violation to save Huhne greater punishment on his license. It represented, under British law, ""perverting the course of justice."" Huhne pleaded guilty; both he and his ex-wife were sentenced to jail terms. Huhne cites emails among key personnel at key moments of its proposals in 2010 and 2011 to claim that News UK's chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, and Lewis had stoked the targeting of the Liberal Democrat politicians. She was forced to resign in summer 2011, at the height of the furor and was brought back to lead News UK a year after she was found not guilty of related criminal chages. Cable says phone records show he received more than 380 calls from Murdoch's tabloid journalists but that he had few actual conversations. Huhne similarly cites 222 such calls. Each man says they presume the ""overwhelming majority"" of the calls were part of efforts to break into their voicemail accounts. Cable says he expects to reach a settlement with News UK as well. Cable publicly apologized for what he framed as intemperate private remarks about Murdoch. In the interview with NPR, Huhne acknowledges his own behavior, once seen by light of day, drew interest and denunciation. Huhne adds a warning. ""I have never claimed to be a saint, but my behavior had nothing to do with either illegal information gathering for corporate espionage, or a fishing expedition designed to intimidate or destroy elected officials,"" Huhne says. ""This was not a journalistic exercise holding power to account. It was a proprietor using his media power to further his own interests."" He called for Scotland Yard to reopen an investigation, this time looking at News Corp.'s directors and executives rather than its journalistic ranks. Huhne also offered to help any cases against the Murdochs in the U.S. - including suits alleging failure to meet fiduciary responsibility by the leaders of Fox Corp. and Fox News for defaming Dominion.",12190,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/05/1217156258/ex-british-officials-say-murdoch-tabloids-hacked-them-to-aid-corporate-agenda,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,side account property change national coalition fever reject invokes effort time lewis influence minute arm concentration publish scoop star defamation voicemail damage editor failure book issue historical scandalous oppose refer publisher pay cable pervert conduct london cabinet lobbyist disconnect fiduciary license yard commercial sentence note drew frame judge columnist office month report cameron majority purely compromise announce statement save freedom celebrity favour political bbc suppose alleges close file alarm full claimed lawyer role takeover robinson target remark chages fraud jail npr receive conversation consolidate storm actual legitimate give record control exert leak involves medium involvement plead world lamb day cnbc acquire apology material business renew revive strongly defame point james coverage testimony cheat personnel director involve privately jeremy former share clear accountant extremely inappropriate law implausible lachlan revenge technology sort grace represent overwhelm gossip effectively authority case punishment similar proposal financial date weigh schedule testify repeat light journalist chris judgment unreserved undermine elect email process meeting fact million extend late believe victory imply scene starker conservative key break discuss scandal year harry network publicly taint sun vicky challenge constituent hire video write paid personal basically chill expect sum donald entertainment illegal position incident owner huge seek david information colleague block guest positive reopen acknowledges pryce lawsuit sensitive bit attorney agree brought july speed amendment european gaudier manhattan lobbying lead rebuke gathering leveson foremost member meet apologize journal learn surround destroy figure atlantic purpose withdrew handle post sought related prince vast caption story earlier newspaper sunday reach longer bid saint call fishing politician obtain prominent quest court corp matthew text add french staffer schoolgirl revelation president tuesday week enable leverage dead deal direction giant huhne europe trump allegation piece found communication comcast pitch phone subject fee drama voice regulator liberal aide prominently adjudicate reality jurisdiction hide furor settle claim incoming michel public sell frédéric question exercise broke corporate system democratic litigation wholly stoke murdoch news espionage baseless cost page critic term accord design country force unlawfully ambitious taped rupert judicial major similarly broadcasting york idly street upscale comment deny retribution executive grip denunciation skeptical threaten brook asserts ensue period campaign scotland past warn rebekah affair nightclub broadcast witness intemperate company read talk guilty presume follow editorial tax matter justice macron result spokesperson hack tabloid ruling hit proper attempt generic violation reply senior large buyout offer billion leader show substantial behavior drive top declare reveal britain copy suggest dominion attack disney journalistic intimidate respond proprietor chairman dollar parliament course allege height embarrass criminal current smartmatic pity operation image private aloof document event emmanuel series brother told resign state brian join vince interest voting step elder agenda secretary blockbuster intend expedition sustain fox official roil back outrage hold woman fall support fine acquisition decide direct legal democrat election echo market government arrange headline hunt early shortly great behalf investigation include broadcaster strong exact norman interview empire access currently oversee familiar fresh prime british score paper mail motive integrity settlement minister proceed responsibility sky favor inquiry newsworthy left rank suit marriage message part summer power previously nationally tail chief wall defense publishing express tech kompromat strip young moment spin stake request hooper washington addition oath wife uk pressure decision telegraph weaken police formal,-0.97945,0.14766201804758,8.719863247863245,0.389950873613294,0,2023-12-05
CNN,Yet-to-be-built Dubai penthouse sells for record $136 million,2023-12-05 08:26:00,Jacopo Prisco,"A five-bedroom penthouse covering almost 22,000 square feet has sold in Dubai for 500 million UAE dirhams — just over $136 million — setting a new record for one of the world’s busiest luxury real estate markets.Set atop a 71-story tower called Como Residences, the yet-to-be-built apartment is located on the exclusive Palm Jumeirah, an archipelago of artificial islands known for its designer villas, upscale hotels and beach clubs with infinity pools.Built just over 20 years ago, the archipelago spans an area of 560 hectares (1,380 acres) and is home to about 80,000 people. Its newest attraction is the Palm Tower, a 52-story, 760-foot-tall (232-meter) hotel and private residence skyscraper with a public, 360-degree observation deck right at the top, offering stunning views of the Dubai coastline.The Como Residences are currently under construction and Provident Estate, the Dubai agency that brokered the sale, says it anticipates completion by late 2027 — meaning the buyer of the penthouse will have to wait at least three more years before they can enjoy their purchase.The previous record for a penthouse sale in Dubai dates back just a few months, when an apartment occupying the top floor of the Marsa Al Arab Hotel sold for 420 million UAE dirhams (about $114 million). According to Provident Estate, the penthouse at Como Residences is the third most expensive in the world, after Penthouse D at One Hyde Park in London, priced at $237 million, and the Odeon Tower Penthouse in Monaco, priced at $440 million.The Como Residences penthouse features a 360-degree sky pool, and is in a “strategically located” spot in Dubai with views of Burj Al Arab, Burj Khalifa – the world’s tallest building – and Dubai Marina, Sam Horani, an associate partner at Provident Estate, told CNN. Horani said the agency won’t reveal the identity of the buyer, but adds “they are from Eastern Europe.”According to its developer, Nakheel, the Como Residences tower will be over 300 meters (984 feet) tall, meeting the definition of supertall skyscraper. Limited to just 76 apartments, from two to seven bedrooms, it includes an elevated private sandy beach, a 25-meter lap pool and a rooftop infinity pool. Each floor is occupied by one or two residences only, served by private elevators. The starting price for the units was set at 21 million dirhams, about $5.7 million.“It’s a very exclusive property, it’s very much a trophy asset,” says Chris Boswell, a Dubai-based luxury real estate agent who was not involved with the sale. He adds that due to the limited availability of properties like this, he’s not surprised someone is prepared to wait years for it. “There aren’t any real large-scale penthouses like that, unless you go for something that is off plan, meaning under construction. And people are prepared to wait that long for the best ones.”Boswell, who has brokered sales of up to $55 million in the region, says there has been a shift in the type of buyers in the last few years. “We’re seeing a lot more people now who are buying to live here,” he says. “For many years, we were predominantly dealing with speculative investors, but now Dubai is not the same landscape as it was before; it’s not full of cranes and construction, and people are coming here to live now. I’m seeing a lot more inquiries coming from the United States, from Italy, from France, from the UK.”He adds that one of the factors that motivates people to move to the area is safety. But when it comes to the asking price for a penthouse, the view is one of the key drivers. “The view is of massive importance,” he says. “And the view from this specific penthouse will be unmatched.”",3669,https://www.cnn.com/travel/dubai-penthouse-sells-for-record-136-million-spc-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180716132438-jacopo-prisco.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dubai top wait reveal hectare deal developer property long landscape specific due sam boswell buyer beach france date safety home trophy elevator dirham club price chris strategically busiest provident united khalifa meeting start unmatched eastern million apartment view late predominantly arab sandy floor estate observation elevate nakheel key factor broker luxury private public sell locate marina told year cnn ago cover set state london tallest region massive park move supertall lot construction anticipates building skyscraper availability driver back accord jumeirah unit bedroom month tall horani area meter live crane upscale associate include serve buying speculative full type artificial currently completion square acre uae foot agency span sky inquiry infinity deck enjoy palm designer villa record monaco asset definition pool plan italy motivates shift island surprised importance attraction world limited hyde atop stun residence penthouse expensive archipelago investor previous call tower meaning real partner add offering exclusive occupy rooftop involve odeon burj marsa feature spot prepared agent identity,0.96945,0.2452984464431725,7.859078590785902,0.420347261434218,0,2023-12-05
CNN,A groundbreaking new Ralph Lauren collection celebrates Indigenous design,2023-12-05 07:58:00,Fawnia Soo Hoo,"Growing up in Rock Point, Arizona in the Navajo Nation, Ralph Lauren’s inaugural “artist in residence,” Naiomi Glasses, already held a close connection with the New York City-based label.“It’s always been a brand that I can associate with family,” the seventh-generation Diné (Navajo) textile artist and weaver told CNN, recalling how her mom would dress her in Ralph Lauren polos, Oxford shoes and knit dresses, but paired with traditional Diné pieces — a fashion practice she continues today. (Diné is translated as “the people” in the community’s own language; “Navajo” is derived from the Tewa-Pueblo term “nava hu,” or “place of large planted fields.”)Family is extremely important to Glasses, who learned weaving from her paternal grandmother and her brother (and design partner). Glasses initially envisioned creating “floor rugs, blankets and possibly fashion” as a career path — though “possibly” turned out to be quite the understatement.“I really have to thank both my mom Cynthia and my dad Tyler Sr. for instilling this confidence in me,” said Glasses, crediting her parents for encouraging her to realize her dreams — and of working with Ralph Lauren specifically.After finishing an internship with Creative Futures Collective, which paired her with Gabriella Hearst to weave colorful details onto the designer’s Spring-Summer 2022 runway pieces, she received a call from the organization’s co-founder Jai Al-Attas: “I met someone that works at Ralph Lauren,” she recalled them saying. “And apparently, they have been wanting to get in contact with you.”Since its foundation in 1967, Ralph Lauren has established itself as a fashion arbiter of a singular “Americana” aesthetic, oft-associated with its iconic polo shirts, cable-knit sweaters and khakis. Historically, the country club uniform, and its related culture, conjures connotations both of exclusivity and exclusion, but in recent years the label has worked to redefine its brand means to consumers.In 2020, Ralph Lauren launched initiatives to expand its “collegiate sensibility,” which first resulted in a 2022 collaboration with Morehouse and Spelman Colleges incorporating the traditions and styles of historically Black colleges and universities. That same year, it announced the “artist in residence” series, which highlights Native and Indigenous artisans — a program that’s part of “broader efforts to shift from inspiration to collaboration with communities that have inspired Ralph Lauren,” the label said in a statement.“Ralph Lauren has always been inspired by the people, art and cultures that make up America,” wrote David Lauren, son of founder Ralph and the company’s chief branding and innovation officer, in an email to CNN. “What has changed is how we are bringing these stories to life and ensuring that we do so in a way that is inclusive of those who own them.”“We are a window for the world into America — not just American style,” he added. “That’s a real responsibility, and that means continuously asking ourselves what is inspirational and aspirational to us and pushing ourselves to be more and more authentic in the stories we tell.”The Polo Ralph Lauren x Naiomi Glasses collaboration kicks off the program on December 5, with the first of three seasonal limited edition drops featuring menswear, womenswear, unisex apparel and accessories.“For the longest time, Americana fashion hasn’t included designers of Indigenous descent, and we are the first people of this land,” said Glasses. “This collection will definitely broaden what ‘Americana’ fashion can be.”The designer, activist and TikTok-famous skateboarder enthusiastically “reimagined” signature Ralph Lauren silhouettes, like the Great Ranch Coat, an outerwear piece she’d admired for years. “I already had envisioned what would look really beautiful on it,” said Glasses: She proposed a fabrication of undyed wool, blended with soft alpaca fleece, to evoke the feel and meaning of “wearing blankets,” which the Diné and Indigenous people cherish both for functionality and as heirlooms (though her versions are “more modernized,” she added).Glasses also worked closely with the Ralph Lauren design teams to incorporate meaningful Diné motifs and “little nuances” into the collection, like directional weaving patterns and the Spider Woman cross symbol on shawl collar coats and poncho wraps. “The spider woman is a deity from our Navajo creation story, who taught Navajos how to weave,” she explained.Other motifs, also including Saltillo diamonds and four-directional crosses, represent traditional Diné design elements — and, significantly, ones that pre-date those popularized after the arrival of late-1800s colonial trading posts, and other outside influences catering to White settlers, saw many of the community’s practices altered and appropriated.In other words, Glasses’ celebration of her “Americana” is also about reclaiming it. “Navajo pieces (originally) were mostly utilitarian and just designs that we, as Diné, thought were beautiful,” Glasses said. “So it was just me, weaving exactly how they would, just true to their own style.”A particularly meaningful part of Glasses’ long-time fascination with Ralph Lauren’s brand has been with its accessories; she recalled, as a teenager, being awestruck by the gleaming jewelry pieces on display at the label’s flagship in Phoenix. At the time, Glasses had already begun amassing an impressive turquoise collection, inspired by her grandmother.Now as part of her residency’s work, Glasses is paying it forward by giving a platform to contemporary Indigenous jewelry makers, including Hopi designer Piki Wadsworth, whose silver and turquoise pieces, will be available online and in select Ralph Lauren flagships.I thought it was very important that I brought up other Indigenous creatives along with me on this journey,” she said.The curated jewelry, along with pieces from Glasses’ own archive and, of course, her clothing designs all grace a stunning new campaign, lensed by Osage multihyphenate and “Reservation Dogs” writer Ryan RedCorn and Navajo photographer (and Glasses’ friend) Daryn Sells.Across the campaign’s photos and video, Glasses felt especially heartened to see Indigenous representation, in-front-of- and behind-the-camera. “Ryan was able to capture key important moments, even something as simple as joy and laughter,” she explained. “He’s like, ‘It’s important that we capture these things because for so long, we, as indigenous people, are painted as being stoic.’ There’s beauty in seeing Indigenous joy.”That’s also because along with the likes of famous models Quannah Chasinghorse and Phillip Bread, and the musician Mato Mayuhi, the campaign’s lineup also included Glasses herself, her brother, Tyler, and their parents.“In a production that big, just having that connection with a community of people that you knew being there, it felt special,” said Glasses. “There were a lot of people I hold near and dear.”",6963,https://www.cnn.com/style/ralph-lauren-naiomi-glasses-indigenous-artist-residence/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/j000774-s1-025-9468-1-crop.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,daryn online instill reclaim inspirational uniform change authentic style hearten piece explain jewelry effort time ranch collection coat production cynthia musician influence turquoise menswear maker nation residency colorful signature felt incorporate family functionality broaden floor silhouette particularly unisex contemporary naiomi big pay rug quannah fascination conjures redefine aesthetic brand laughter lot beauty sensibility capture white lineup window phillip possibly runway design term historically enthusiastically outerwear navajo country element founder confidence osage chasinghorse definitely impressive accessory announce apparel originally textile knew bring language aspirational york deity close associate today nava directional derive heirloom art x skateboarder cross campaign indigenous redcorn translate tyler envision receive jai tradition college turn designer give foundation evoke reservation push finish curated culture alpaca trading shift creatives admire native gleam company meaningful kick blanket dear world arrival limited inspiration word expand result phoenix residence future fleece piki point meaning large officer real archive broader connection undyed collaboration morehouse make spider grow dress shoe practice representation artist feel extremely forward pair version collar apparently propose long dad hearst grace represent teenager clothing artisan gabriella begin motif path ryan soft mato significantly mom awestruck club community joy email creative select exclusivity multihyphenate course contact parent simple weave plant photo womenswear career fabrication friend reimagined paint lauren display taught exclusion mayuhi wrap photographer seasonal beautiful key singular dream settler important poncho glass writer internship series brother khaki initiative organization year cherish creation popularize alter told traditional cnn catering pattern december program modernize available sweater continuously wear rock video america flagship write bread detail hold descent woman celebration ralph wadsworth special black team shirt recent recall life americana david paternal ensure polo great continue include place inaugural encourage diné innovation closely hopi platform american highlight brought collective realize knit silver iconic spelman responsibility model journey saltillo credit land label especially edition amass create symbol drop utilitarian shawl learn held establish part inclusive launch weaver chief famous post related activist lensed arbiter stun fashion story initially arizona grandmother wool blend call colonial inspire nuance branding collegiate moment diamond partner add work connotation feature oxford university,0.99865,0.0,10.278994668697637,0.5473484848484849,0,2023-12-05

Politico,Silicon Valley’s AI boom collides with a skeptical Sacramento,2023-12-05 05:00:00,Jeremy B. White,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Silicon Valley’s freewheeling artificial intelligence industry is about to face its first major policy roadblocks — not in Washington, but in its own backyard.Efforts to control the fast-spreading technology — where machines are taught to think and act like humans — will dominate Sacramento next year as California lawmakers prepare at least a dozen bills aimed at curbing what are widely seen as AI’s biggest threats to society. The legislative push, first reported by POLITICO, will target the technology’s potential to eliminate vast numbers of jobs, intrude on workers’ privacy, sow election misinformation, imperil public safety and make decisions based on biased algorithms.The upcoming clash will cast California in a familiar role as a de facto U.S. regulator in the absence of federal action, as has happened with data privacy, online safety standards for children and vehicle-emission requirements — and a force multiplier for the European Union’s more stringent approach.It will set lawmakers eager to avoid letting another transformative technology spiral out of control — and powerful labor unions intent on protecting jobs — against the deep-pocketed tech industry. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, an innovation evangelist who wants to impose safeguards while maintaining California’s economic edge, will undoubtedly shape negotiations behind the scenes.“Generative AI is a potentially world-changing technology for unimaginable benefit, but also incalculable cost and harm,” Jason Elliott, Newsom’s point person on artificial intelligence, said in an interview. “I don’t know that anyone in the world — not Google, not (OpenAI founder) Sam Altman, certainly not Gavin Newsom — knows what the full trajectory of this technology is.”California lawmakers have already ensured 2024 will be far busier than past years by unveiling legislation to limit the use of actors’ AI-generated voices and likenesses, stamp watermarks on digital content, root out prejudice in tools informing decisions in housing and health care and compel AI companies to prepare for apocalyptic scenarios. More bills are coming — including a long list of union-backed measures seeking to limit the negative fallout for workers.“I hope we’re learning lessons from the advent of the Internet, where we didn’t act in a regulatory fashion in the way we needed to,” said Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a Bay Area Democrat who chairs the Assembly’s Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee and is reviving legislation that would safeguard against bias in artificial intelligence.Propelled into public consciousness by tools like ChatGPT, a chatbot that creates human-like conversations and has been used to write legal motions, news releases and essays, next-generation artificial intelligence has captured the public imagination and drawn billions of dollars in investment. It’s also drawn scrutiny from the White House, whose sweeping AI framework has informed California’s work, and statehouses where lawmakers are discussing potential legislation.But the stakes for the industry’s future are highest in California given the state’s market-shaping massiveness, its tendency to model legislation for other blue states, an emerging artificial intelligence sector that is driving a resurgence in San Francisco’s beleaguered tech economy and enormous Democratic margins that make it a policy factory at a time of paralysis in Washington.“I think everyone’s radar is up for AI bills in California and all across the country,” said Adam Kovacevich, who heads the Washington-based tech industry group Chamber of Progress.Newsom recently issued an executive order to study how the state can deploy and nurture the burgeoning industry while limiting the risk — a balancing act that could squeeze him between executives that include campaign donors and regulation-eager lawmakers.Yet the Democratic lawmakers who control Sacramento are determined to act soon. Many of them draw parallels to social media, arguing policymakers failed to realize the downsides until it was too late. They are backed by polling showing widespread public concern in California about election disinformation and job-erasing automation.In just the last few months, suddenly everyone wants to run an AI bill.“It’s night and day,” said Landon Klein, a former consultant for the California Assembly committee that hears AI bills who now oversees U.S. Policy at the Future of Life Institute. The organization seeks to limit the fallout of AI and spearheaded an open letter — signed by Elon Musk — urging a halt in experimentation. “Even up until January of this year, I would see an AI bill come to my desk very occasionally.”California’s supermajority-Democratic Legislature regularly advances ambitious progressive policies that set the national agenda. But proposals to regulate AI will need to overcome a formidable industry counteroffensive. Groups that have spent recent years battling California lawmakers on social media liability — like a bill imposing penalties for harms to kids that is currently tied up in a court fight — are now preparing to play defense on AI. Their opposition stalled a bill last year that would have addressed bias in decision-making algorithms.In the coming year, they will likely be fighting on multiple fronts. They are already studying Newsom’s executive order and contending with draft regulations from the state’s digital privacy watchdog that would allow Californians to opt out of having their personal data included in AI models. The Legislature will represent another hurdle.“In the tech space, this is going to be the issue,” said an industry lobbyist who was granted anonymity to discuss legislative strategy. “This is the topic we’ll all be dealing with this legislative session into the next couple of years.”As industry groups prepare to confront a wave of legislation in California, they are using a familiar talking point, one that Altman of OpenAI made to Congress in May: We want to be regulated as long as we can help shape the rules.“We as an industry want to take a proactive stance when it comes to these bills, we want to be at the table and we want to be part of the solution,” said Dylan Hoffman, a former California legislative staffer who is now a lobbyist for the tech employer group TechNet.Some of the bills under discussion seek to address a range of hazards, such as AI-driven bioweapons — a prominent concern in President Joe Biden’s executive order. State Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who is pursuing legislation to curb public safety threats like AI-powered bioweapons and cyberattacks, said policymakers must move with urgency.“Some of this is not futuristic,” Wiener said. “These are risks that are with us right now and we’re way behind in addressing them.”Elliott, Newsom’s aide, agreed that public safety should be the preeminent concern. But Elliott warned policymakers should proceed cautiously because “it’s too early in the life cycle of this technology” to make assumptions about how AI will affect society. That warning may be a window into the governor’s cautious approach, a stance that could put him at odds with lawmakers’ zeal to reign in the industry.“I would be assuming a very great level of understanding about where this technology is headed in the next six months, two years, 10 years,” Elliott said, and “we as a government don’t have that.”Newsom already prized innovation over safety and workforce fears this year when he vetoed a labor-priority bill limiting the deployment of self-driving trucks. In the coming year, labor unions who wield significant clout in Sacramento are expected to play a significant role in pushing for limits on AI in ways that affect jobs and working conditions.“We brought our unions together with experts and historians to really talk about how we approach this,” said Lorena Gonzalez, a former state lawmaker who’s now the top official at the California Labor Federation, an umbrella group of major state unions. “We have to talk about jobs — we can’t just be fascinated with technology and not realize that technology is going to have an effect on jobs.”In 2022, unions rallied behind a bill from a progressive Silicon Valley Democrat that would have curbed industry’s ability to monitor workers and dictate labor conditions with AI tools — only to see it blocked amid opposition from business foes that included insurers, grocers, and bankers.It was a show of force that the author, Assemblymember Ash Kalra, called a testament to AI’s “broad impact on every single person.”But Kalra is gearing up for another round, this time partnering with SAG-AFTRA on a bill that would limit the use of AI to replicate actors’ work — an echo of strike-related concerns that halted Hollywood for months this year as workers warned of encroaching technology.“It’s not a coincidence you’re seeing a lot of interest in trying to regulate or at least trying to understand better how artificial intelligence is going to impact us, both in a positive and in a nefarious sense,” Kalra said. “When those advances don’t elevate everyone and just profit the very wealthy at the expense of the privacy and dignity of workers, that’s where you have the dystopian future that we’re all afraid of.”Artificial intelligence can be a tricky concept to define, sitting on a spectrum of gradual technological advancement in a way that complicates regulation. Elliott pointed out that crimes ripe for exploitation through AI, like financial fraud, are already illegal and embedded in tightly regulated fields.Industry groups are preparing to make related arguments as they seek to thwart or dilute bills in Sacramento.“Some of what policymakers are calling ‘AI’ is really just technology,” Chamber of Progress’ Kovacevich said. “Some of these bills are going to have an AI label on them, but they’ll be resurfacing old debates — automation, privacy, competition, speech, kids.”Elliott said Newsom was focused on protecting Californians from the downsides of the new tools, including by guiding how government agencies procure and use artificial intelligence. But the governor — never one to shy away from the spotlight — also sees an opportunity to lead. Elliott noted that Biden selected San Francisco for an AI summit — and then sat next to Newsom at the June event.“The same way that for example, California is a global leader on setting clean car standards,” Elliott said, “we have the market size, and we have the ability to lead and start to define what government responsible use looks like in this emerging space.”“We are not Austin, Texas,” he added. “We are not Miami, Florida. We are not Phoenix, Arizona. California is the epicenter of global innovation.”",10741,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/california-ai-regulation-legislation-00129964,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/357a8f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F24%2F10%2Fd1edb0a641fbb58de105917b9c8d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1258872971,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,californian halt draw national evangelist clash reign expense time blue act discussion fail happen misinformation lorena data january legislative fear release shy issue truck kid big fight argue spent action set bias requirement dilute lobbyist lot high capture roadblock federation battling consciousness ripe thwart note spiral wield klein testament facto report month society unimaginable watermark front area elliott opposition assembly human penalty bill valley order proactive powerful approach full monitor potentially imagination progress employer texas imperil tricky nefarious role target california fraud chair sow negotiation prepare agency conversation progressive policymakers give control desk push procure medium away limit advent base fallout liability zeal world hoffman benefit replicate responsible day stringent study business revive intent workforce dignity point safeguard austin silicon resurgence widespread incalculable wiener technological labor make rally eliminate spearhead san former job opportunity futuristic burgeon maintain technology represent radar lawmaker proposal financial grocer sweep dylan session define donor select transformative bay grant late advance encroach margin consumer space investment disinformation discuss determine federal ash year organization hope letter content odds focus write shape clean personal gov expect illegal curb elon trajectory seek recently life massiveness gavin block newsom positive hears overcome wave solution range hazard agree brought afraid landon scrutiny regularly social european guide tightly lead prize creates label joe politico confront learn actor stance advancement downside drawn level related assume vast threat legislation widely fashion exploitation edge deploy call prominent june head court sign spotlight consultant put add apocalyptic chatbot preeminent staffer work president stall online deal anonymity round undoubtedly single complicates chamber child eager worker jason group rebecca statehouse competition tool couple gonzalez voice regulator deployment protection aide negative curbed global multiplier oversees tendency draft amid formidable public wealthy factory run affect committee democratic news white cost window regulation parallel watchdog cycle umbrella governor summit founder absence force country regulate intelligence ambitious suddenly major bioweapon concern strategy risk balance lesson upcoming executive miami artificial resurface emerge address freewheel person campaign hollywood unveil past impact warn clout gear tie number union company root talk health internet squeeze vetoed scenario author phoenix standard polling future contend paralysis economy busier billion adam beleaguer sacramento housing ability leader show crime machine debate digital urge drive policy top sat dozen expert long sam kalra nurture pursue safety institute essay night legislature industry dollar likeness start size framework discus dystopian avoid taught prejudice regulatory assemblymember concept cautiously elevate aim sector state opt interest effect agenda move compel epicenter privacy cast table google florida official house scott dominate back measure generative argument counteroffensive embed recent condition francisco legal democrat election enormous echo profit market government cyberattacks spectrum early ensure potential great significant include fascinate gradual interview impose multiple open currently musk congress familiar foe realize proceed chatgpt car model assumption altman list biden protect intrude part experimentation understand economic dictate defense harm insurer tech broad arizona openai cautious historian stake motion washington partner inform kovacevich coincidence speech play decision topic automation innovation stamp,0.97725,0.1955125221115352,10.88622131565528,0.4232103385120627,0,2023-12-05

Washington Post,"For Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, the big screen feels like a tight fit",2023-12-05 05:00:00,Chris Richards,"For elite pop stars trying to keep their money trees lush and leafy through the cold months, a new strategy has emerged at the multiplex: Transpose your history-making, millions-grossing summer tour into celluloid and watch the seats fill up all over again.With the respective box-office successes of “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé” and “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” two of civilization’s most famous voices have made the migration from the stadium to the big screen appear pretty much effortless, as if the line between a pop star and a movie star were simply something to be stepped over. As for the rest of us strugglers whose money trees resemble dead houseplants, the pros and cons feel tightly intertwined. Yes, these movies make the outrageously expensive act of mainstream concert-going more affordable, more accessible — while still allowing those concert ticket prices to remain obscene. And yes, these films might create a surrogate live music experience that feels surprisingly intimate and freshly communal — while still allowing these hyper-exposed celebrities to encroach on new precincts of the cultural mindshare. If you’re short on cash for overpriced things and flush with attention span for overpraised things, this is your time.But there’s still art happening beneath all of this commerce, and the biggest metaphysical surprise awaiting you inside your local movie theater is how “the big screen” somehow makes these two seem smaller. It should be a jolt to suddenly see Beyoncé’s face 25 feet tall, casting its beatific glow on a gathering of strangers in a dark room, but if you’ve ever caught her in concert, you’ve already witnessed her smile on one of those gigantic, four-story LED screens capable of making her flyaways look as thick as telephone wire to everyone up on the 400-level.The “Renaissance” tour — a maximalist visual extravaganza of sci-fi set design, otherworldly costuming and chrome-plated stage props — simply had to shrink to fit inside a movie screen, so Beyoncé takes the opportunity to zoom in on details that might have whooshed past our faces in real life. The film’s performances are spliced together from dates across the tour, girded by documentary segments in which our narrator wants us to know that this whole thing was planned down to the sequin (cue footage of designers at sewing machines). Neat trick, that. Now we’re watching this electric concert footage far more attentively, and if you were lucky enough to see the show in real life, and you failed to notice, say, that little pearl-shaped throw pillow sitting inside the robotic seashell that Beyoncé emerged from during “Virgo’s Groove,” here it is, reminding you that masterpieces are made of tiny brushstrokes you never fully noticed.In that sense, “Renaissance” feels like a film for those who missed it, whereas “The Eras Tour” presents itself as a concert substitute for fans who still want in. Shot across two identical shows at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., the film obeys the contours of Swift’s set list, one massive hit after another, cameras cutting to the jubilant crowd now and again, but keeping the focus tightly on Swift as she makes nearly three hours of singing sound like a total breeze. As for her dancing, it includes lots of lyrical pantomime and only seems completely natural when she’s skipping. There is one visually surprising bit during “Blank Space” where Swift twirls a golf club made to glow like a Star Wars lightsaber with half-smiling half-menace, but otherwise, she’s entirely happy to let her songs do the work. And this is work. The greatest thing about this movie is that we can see her sweat.Plopped in the pillowy seats of a climate-controlled movie theater, we do not sweat. We can scream if we want to, but our cheers can’t match the exaltations of an overfilled football stadium. Even at their most energizing and exciting, these two films simply can’t ever hope to match the visceral thrill of music when it’s unfolding before youin real time, amid a massive public assembly where everyone’s applause becomes part of the greater sound event. At a concert, you are a participant. In a movie theater, you’re a spectator.Unless these two exceptionally starry concert films are offering us a new thing: An opportunity for spectators to participate with one another. My moviegoing experiences were obviously anecdotal — “Eras” was a late-pass showing at noon on Black Friday; “Renaissance,” was a sparsely attended opening-day matinee — but I felt a similar sense of communion at each screening. The singalongs were mostly nonstop, but also politely quiet, delivered with inside voices, which made me wonder if I’d ever been surrounded by this many strangers who were this comfortable sharing the sounds of their own la-la-la. Whether it was “Break My Soul” or “Bad Blood,” their timbres weren’t lost in a howling din. Inside the movie theater, I could hear strangers connecting to this impersonal, mass-media event in a delicate, unguarded way. That felt like a first.Between the songs? Gentle, satisfied applause. Happy clapping and some woo-hoos here and there. But who was it for? Everyone agrees that those women up on the screen can’t hear us, right? This was another first. Or if not that, perhaps the surfacing of some hidden truth: What if, instead of applauding concert performers in an act of noise-making gratitude, we’ve just been applauding for one another all along, using our hands and voices to forge some kind of sonic consensus?",5508,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2023/12/05/concert-films-taylor-swift-beyonce-live-music/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,share celluloid felt communal tour present truth tall entirely hear taylor costume anecdotal detail splice date surprising sound cue mindshare notice cut flyaways theater make song smile simply blood surrogate woman tightly consensus deliver civilization moviegoing remain singalong performance participant live nonstop zoom break fail quiet expensive suddenly unguarded price extravaganza intertwine intimate watch room camera cultural overfill experience dark neat await stranger prop skip massive gathering clap hope throw surprisingly celebrity accessible identical mainstream club set inside flush participate pillow surround breeze exaltation groove fully gird assembly fit cash masterpiece delicate blank rest hidden hand visual robotic part stadium brushstrokes work happy documentary otherworldly youin pantomime screen footage virgo surprise overprice precinct glow obeys substitute space total act sequin show kind narrator lucky crowd shot timbre movie famous machine lyrical noon gigantic dance multiplex list jolt happen freshly attend maximalist contour seashell cold hit amid thick thrill plan bit sofi wire wonder focus pop houseplant foot visually twirl time lightsaber match public create migration leafy attentively similar tiny connect art voice overpraise film stage whoosh beatific matinee performer satisfied black real sew step hour concert agrees friday lush money local transpose renaissance affordable comfortable pretty small telephone communion scream forge struggler opportunity summer jubilant elite big visceral beneath respective month excite starry howl event sparsely sweat metaphysical strategy beyoncé outrageously pillowy past cheer seat capable sonic line caught soul miss remind obscene resemble attention star segment trick swift music emerge design include tree pro short feel inglewood commerce instead life spectator cast lead witness success completely football impersonal fill great natural exceptionally designer energize offering sing lot gentle gratitude span applause ticket shrink effortless dead encroach electric surface unfold lose golf applaud politely,0.9981,0.326797385620915,8.854035747883344,0.5031942804670075,0,2023-12-05

ABC,Save up to 66% on Linens & Hutch bedding!,2023-12-05 04:05:00,Katie Kindelan,"Rizk, 44, said she had her big idea on a day when she was feeling “really defeated” that she couldn’t get her daughter Yasmine, now 20, to take off her winter coat in order to get into her car seat.“When I calmed down, I thought about it again and realized if the zipper wasn’t in the middle of the jacket, this wouldn’t be a problem,” said Rizk, now a mom of three in Londonderry, New Hampshire.Rizk faced the same dilemma as all parents in cold weather areas -- wrangling their child into a car seat, then into a coat when they get out of the car and out of the coat when they get back into the car. Car seat safety advocates recommend that children not wear anything thicker than a sweatshirt in a car seat in order to keep the harness straps close to their bodies.Unable to find any coat company that made specially designed kids’ coats, Rizk took her own children's coats apart and moved the zipper to the side, allowing fabric to be moved out of the way of the harnesses.She didn't think anything more of her invention until three years ago when she saw a mom struggling who reminded her of herself as a mom of young kids.""It was a gross, slushy kind of day and the blanket the mom used for the kid in the car seat was dragging in the mud,"" Rizk said of the scene she witnessed in a parking lot. ""And the mom had that same defeated look I had so many years ago.""Empowered by social media, Rizk found someone who could make a prototype of the jacket she designed. She then found a lab in Michigan where she took the jacket to have it crash tested.""What I wanted to do was have the coat perform as similarly to no coat as possible, and that’s what it did,"" said Rizk, who had the coats tested by Intertek and said they are compliant with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.Rizk, a mental health counselor who runs her own private practice, used her design to create her own company, Buckle Me Baby Coats.The coats, ranging in price from $79 to $150, open along the side so there is a front panel that can be removed. The coats also open along the shoulder seams, which are set back so the front panels can be pulled aside, allowing the car seat harness to sit directly on the child's chest and shoulders.Rizk posted a video of her nephew wearing her coat design on Facebook in December 2016 that drew so much interest she launched a Kickstarter campaign just a few months later.She started selling the coats, which come in children's sizes ranging from 6 to 9 months to size 14, online in September 2017.Rizk runs the company out of her home with help from her two younger children, a 16-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son. They call Buckle Me Baby Coats their mom's ""fourth child,"" according to Rizk.""I think it’s what moms do when they see something wrong,"" she said. ""I said, 'Let me see if this works,' and it did. I said, 'Let me see if there is interest,' and there was.""Like Rizk, two other moms also formed companies that make car-seat adaptable coats for kids, One Kid and 7 A.M. Enfant.""They’ve all seen a need for it with their own kids,"" said Dr. Alisa Baer, a New York City-based pediatrician and co-founder of The Car Seat Lady, who added that the car seat-adaptable coats are best for short drives, like to the local grocery store.""If the drive is going to be long and you’re going to be turning up the heat and taking off your own coat, then you want to make sure that your child is dressed in a way that they can be comfortable,"" she said. ""You have to use your judgment.""Baer said parents can also outfit their children in layers -- she recommends a short sleeve shirt, long sleeve shirt, hoodie/sweater, tight-fitting fleece jacket -- to wear in a car seat. After the child is buckled snug, they can also wear their coat backwards, with their arms and chest covered, in the seat.""If the child is wearing a coat, parents need to ensure that coat is safe for the car seat,"" said Baer. ""Which means the straps do not have to be tightened even a little bit if the child were to remove the coat.""The key factor is that parents make sure the car seat straps are snug. Most kids, in both winter and summer, are riding in straps that are too loose, according to Baer.Watch her guide here:Editor's Note: Dahlia Rizk appeared on the Dec. 4, 2020, episode of ABC's ""Shark Tank,"" where entrepreneur Daymond John made a deal to invest in Buckle Me Baby Coats.This story was originally posted on Jan. 25, 2019.",4431,https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/family/story/moms-invention-solves-age-dilemma-kids-wearing-coats-60569196,https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/jacket2-ml-190123_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lady snug private gross size interest daughter company coat zipper social mental practice deal make fabric advocate wear turn december winter drive prototype originally pull compliant back intertek range price seam slushy perform jacket grocery factor realize episode recommend harness run fleece shirt enfant set long editor online area wrangle john abc weather health baby struggle tank september arm work layer form found mud parking dress key mom move safe counselor kind panel similarly safety start middle cover kid launch strap judgment cold calm chest drew crash sell baer drag call kickstarter bit rid story daymond invention create invest directly heat front side londonderry dilemma find problem home dahlia post nephew defeat fourth sweatshirt buckle car michigan consumer loose ago local comfortable add recommends thicker store summer pediatrician open big wrong tighten month rizk sleeve facebook improvement adaptable possible york ensure parent accord blanket shoulder seat entrepreneur video remove day year lab outfit campaign remind child yasmine close guide order shark design short feel product idea backwards witness note specially young test alisa medium lot scene empower,0.88105,0.0,5.810333333333329,0.4594722271192861,0,2023-12-05
Reuters,CATL prepares to power up wildest electric dreams,2023-12-05 02:20:00,Katrina Hamlin,"HONG KONG, Dec 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Why would the world’s largest battery maker want to sell shares when it’s already flush with liquidity? After a plan to raise more than $5 billion in Switzerland stalled in March, CATL (300750.SZ) is now considering adding a Hong Kong listing to its Shenzhen-traded stock as soon as next year, IFR reported in November. It ended June with 102 billion yuan ($14 billion) in net cash, Moody’s calculates. Trouble is, much of that is in China. Having more funds readily available offshore would prime the $100 billion group for explosive expansion in Europe and beyond.CATL has just started production at a new facility in Germany and is building a plant in Hungary, its first forays West. CEO Robin Zeng financed these by moving money from China, where his company dominates, and by borrowing overseas. Despite Beijing’s capital controls, he could probably repeat those manouevres again if needed, three analysts told Breakingviews. He should also, over time, be able to call on the substantial cash its international operations will generate; sales outside China already account for almost 36% of revenue, according to Fitch.However, Zeng’s wish list of far-flung destinations is growing fast, too. CATL’s ambitious agreement with Indonesia involves projects ranging from mining raw materials to making and recycling batteries in the resource-rich country. It also has collaborations with Vietnamese Tesla-wannabe Vinfast and Thailand’s Arun Plus. Meanwhile, CATL is testing the U.S. market’s appetite for Chinese suppliers by licensing its advanced lithium iron phosphate technology to Ford Motor (F.N).But battery production is capital intensive: the Hungary facility alone cost more than 7 billion euros. If multiple doors open all at once, even CATL could use some extra resources, and an equity offering would help avoid bloating the balance sheet with more debt. The company’s long-term loans have increased more than tenfold to more than 70 billion yuan and its long-term bonds by around a third to nearly 20 billion yuan since 2020, per Visible Alpha.Granted, it’s hardly good timing for a deal. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index (.HSI) has fallen 16% this year. But as Zeng’s electric dreams accelerate, he’ll want to be sure CATL’s own batteries are fully charged.Follow @KatrinaHamlin on XCONTEXT NEWSChinese electric-vehicle battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology is considering listing in Hong Kong as early as 2024, financial publication IFR reported on Nov. 22, citing sources.The discussions come after regulatory concerns derailed the company’s planned offering of Swiss global depositary receipts earlier this year.

ABC,"China's government can't take a joke, so comedians living abroad censor themselves",2023-12-05 01:36:00,FU TING Associated Press,"WASHINGTON -- Comedian Xi Diao says he knows he should avoid talking politics on stage, but sharing a family name with Chinese President Xi Jinping makes it hard to resist.Even his name is politically sensitive, the Melbourne-based amateur comedian tells audiences, setting up a joke about a group chat on the Chinese messaging service WeChat being shut down as soon as he joined it.The 33-year-old civil engineer gets nervous laughs whenever he breaks a de facto rule of Chinese comedy: Don’t say anything that makes China look bad. To most comedians, that means no jokes about censorship, no mentioning the president's name, and no discussion of China’s extraordinarily strict COVID lockdowns or social topics like domestic violence.“It is a pity, if the environment were open, there would be somebody world-class coming up,” Xi said.Mandarin-language standup comedy is growing, and not just in China. The medium has taken off in the last decade, and China’s expatriate population has established clubs in cities like New York, Tokyo and Madrid.Comedians are known for bristling at limits, but most Mandarin-language comedians, and many fans, say some topics have no place in the comedy club.In China there are censors who review jokes in advance, and punish performers who cross political red lines. Earlier this year, an entertainment company was fined about $2 million when star comedian Li Haoshi made a joke that referenced a Chinese military slogan.Overseas, comedians say they don't fear punishment, but most say political jokes aren't funny, or make people uncomfortable. Many are not very familiar with political humor, after growing up in a country that largely censors it.“We make what the audience likes,” said Guo Jia, a businessman who runs a comedy club in Tokyo. He said discomfort with politics is part of Chinese culture, comparing it to sensitivities about race in the United States.“There are some areas where people won’t go, but it’s not typically because of government policies, but more social pressure or culture or religion,” said Michel Hockx, a professor of Chinese Literature and director of the Liu Institute for Asia and Asian Studies in University of Notre Dame.Comedians do push on social boundaries.For Lin Dongxiao, a 28-year-old comedian who began performing while living in Toronto, it was a chance to talk in public about a congenital disorder that causes limp, and to get crowds laughing with him about how Chinese society treats people with disabilities.Lin, who performs under the stage name “Guazi,” told an audience that women he met online complained that he didn't warn them he had a disability, so he added it to his dating profile.“You’re scrolling … oh gym trainer, nice body; business executive, million-dollar salary; and then…third-class certificate of disability without any allowance.” People burst into laughter.Standup fan Wenlai Cai, a Los Angeles-based software engineer in her early 30s, said that she enjoys hearing jokes about LGBTQ life and race relations, topics that are strictly off limits in the mainland.But “there should be limits on (jokes about) high level politics” Cai said. “That is, political leaders, partisanship … I don’t think it's meaningful to talk about.”There are also a few venues that defy Beijing’s sensibilities. Women's Idea, a feminist group in New York City, hosts uncensored comedy shows that often hit on politics, encouraging women to express themselves on social and political issues.But even roundabout references to politics make most Chinese-language audiences uncomfortable, Xi said. After he performed at a Chinese restaurant in Australia, the owner asked him to be careful; at a standup competition, he got zero audience votes. He’s wound up performing almost exclusively at English-language venues.Zhu Jiesheng, who runs a standup comedy club in Madrid, reviews other performers’ jokes before they go on stage, asking them to strike jokes that could cross political lines.But when a comedian insisted on telling jokes about the Shanghai lockdown, Zhu didn’t stop him. The audience didn’t get the jokes, Zhu said, and it started arguments backstage, leaving him more convinced that politics and comedy don’t mix.Comedians are very aware that people can get into trouble for what they say. Asked about Li Haoshi, comedians said he should have known better.“Even if you do not make mistakes but someone else does, it affects the whole industry,” said Zhong Di, a 30-year-old student in Milan who also performs standup.Lin, who recently moved back to China to pursue a career in standup, said the industry is still recovering from the crackdown set off by his joke.The Associated Press couldn’t reach Li for comment, and the company that manages him didn’t respond to an interview request.China has a record of harassing its nationals abroad for activism. It has also threatened international stars from abroad with boycotts or bans on performing in China. Nigel Ng, a Malaysian comedian based in the UK who created the popular character “Uncle Roger,” lost his Chinese social media accounts after a clip from a live show went viral in which he joked about China listening in through cell phones.Vicky Xu, a Chinese-born journalist in Australia who also performs standup in English, said that Chinese people have a long history of cracking jokes about sensitive topics.“If you look back at a lot of the movies or TV shows made in China like 20, 30 years ago, there are more political jokes than today. So how do you explain that?” she said.Xu, whose work is critical of the Chinese government and who has received blistering blowback from China’s official media and nationalist trolls, said that politics affects people’s lives in China so much that not talking about it is “ignoring the elephant in the room.”When comedians go back to China, they face restrictions beyond what they impose on themselves overseas.Lin said censorship is important to prevent “chaos,” but submitting his material to censors weeks before performances is still a challenge.“No one told me what I could say or not,” said Lin, “which is pretty hard. I just hand in whatever I have, and change it if it doesn’t get approved.”In Australia, Xi doesn’t plan to stop kidding about his famous namesake.",6270,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/chinas-government-joke-comedians-living-abroad-censor-105379322,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/4a8f9125-4efe-4917-ba9e-a32fb10e68a5/wirestory_cb007a11da91249a752178dcc0c26945_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,today troll share living convince liu hockx owner defy jinping country company complain strict restriction social week date asia manages political rule press abroad malaysian culture activism make roundabout engineer associate audience talk earlier boycott comedy woman express restaurant cell prevent decade harass performance laugh live account humor chance beijing break partisanship pursue joke blowback back mistake respond receive military washington message institute punish perform domestic official discussion hard asian service wenlai uk united base treat funny million run diao push wound gym material club set haoshi xi scroll reference crackdown uncensored shut executive online long viral area censor reach impose sensitive covid national cross software affect critical jia group leader stop hand guazi high punishment ng amateur discomfort dongxiao ban red lockdown recently typically part work join policy early race australia mention shanghai environment leave limp move told pressure bristling milan show crowd movie avoid strike important famous submit host aware zhu disability meaningful start nice vote kid student pity sensibility congenital strictly clip uncomfortable hit chat plan civil salary popular advance feminist religion tokyo study lin career crack history madrid explain character competition public create business wechat international interview threaten ignore grow tv businessman enjoys compare comment standup joked nervous chaos zhong stage performer sensitivity president familiar change record performs comedian ago trouble recover censorship pretty insist add careful open largely blistering topic argument encourage exclusively extraordinarily entertainment literature guo establish zero york city listen place fear facto china hearing politically line limit lgbtq year backstage nigel begin cai disorder michel star english jiesheng elephant family director politics chinese university level industry nationalist body government journalist life idea society roger venue fin warn relation xu burst medium trainer lot uncle population namesake professor expatriate lose review toronto certificate,0.05995,0.2392344497607655,9.90370994940978,0.3414864334631776,0,2023-12-05
ABC,AI's future could be 'open-source' or closed. Tech giants are divided,2023-12-05 00:15:00,MATT O'BRIEN AP technology writer,"Tech leaders have been vocal proponents of the need to regulate artificial intelligence, but they’re also lobbying hard to make sure the new rules work in their favor.That's not to say they all want the same thing.Facebook parent Meta and IBM on Tuesday launched a new group called the AI Alliance that’s advocating for an “open science” approach to AI development that puts them at odds with rivals Google, Microsoft and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.These two diverging camps — the open and the closed — disagree about whether to build AI in a way that makes the underlying technology widely accessible. Safety is at the heart of the debate, but so is who gets to profit from AI's advances.Open advocates favor an approach that is “not proprietary and closed,” said Darío Gil, a senior vice president at IBM who directs its research division. ""So it’s not like a thing that is locked in a barrel and no one knows what they are.”The term “open-source” comes from a decades-old practice of building software in which the code is free or widely accessible for anyone to examine, modify and build upon.Open-source AI involves more than just code and computer scientists differ on how to define it depending on which components of the technology are publicly available and if there are restrictions limiting its use. Some use open science to describe the broader philosophy.The AI Alliance — led by IBM and Meta and including Dell, Sony, chipmakers AMD and Intel and several universities and AI startups — is “coming together to articulate, simply put, that the future of AI is going to be built fundamentally on top of the open scientific exchange of ideas and on open innovation, including open source and open technologies,” Gil said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of its unveiling.Part of the confusion around open-source AI is that despite its name, OpenAI — the company behind ChatGPT and the image-generator DALL-E — builds AI systems that are decidedly closed.“To state the obvious, there are near-term and commercial incentives against open source,"" said Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist and co-founder, in a video interview hosted by Stanford University in April. But there's also a longer-term worry involving the potential for an AI system with “mind-bendingly powerful” capabilities that would be too dangerous to make publicly accessible, he said.To make his case for open-source dangers, Sutskever posited an AI system that had learned how to start its own biological laboratory.Even current AI models pose risks and could be used, for instance, to ramp up disinformation campaigns to disrupt democratic elections, said University of California, Berkeley scholar David Evan Harris.“Open source is really great in so many dimensions of technology,” but AI is different, Harris said.“Anyone who watched the movie ‘Oppenheimer’ knows this, that when big scientific discoveries are being made, there are lots of reasons to think twice about how broadly to share the details of all of that information in ways that could get into the wrong hands,” he said.The Center for Humane Technology, a longtime critic of Meta's social media practices, is among the groups drawing attention to the risks of open-source or leaked AI models.“As long as there are no guardrails in place right now, it’s just completely irresponsible to be deploying these models to the public,” said the group's Camille Carlton.An increasingly public debate has emerged over the benefits or dangers of adopting an open-source approach to AI development.Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, this fall took aim on social media at OpenAI, Google and startup Anthropic for what he described as “massive corporate lobbying” to write the rules in a way that benefits their high-performing AI models and could concentrate their power over the technology's development. The three companies, along with OpenAI's key partner Microsoft, have formed their own industry group called the Frontier Model Forum.LeCun said on X, formerly Twitter, that he worried that fearmongering from fellow scientists about AI “doomsday scenarios” was giving ammunition to those who want to ban open-source research and development.“In a future where AI systems are poised to constitute the repository of all human knowledge and culture, we need the platforms to be open source and freely available so that everyone can contribute to them,” LeCun wrote. “Openness is the only way to make AI platforms reflect the entirety of human knowledge and culture.”For IBM, an early supporter of the open-source Linux operating system in the 1990s, the dispute feeds into a much longer competition that precedes the AI boom.“It’s sort of a classic regulatory capture approach of trying to raise fears about open-source innovation,"" said Chris Padilla, who leads IBM's global government affairs team. ""I mean, this has been the Microsoft model for decades, right? They always opposed open-source programs that could compete with Windows or Office. They’re taking a similar approach here.”It was easy to miss the “open-source” debate in the discussion around U.S. President Joe Biden's sweeping executive order on AI.That's because Biden's order described open models with the highly technical name of “dual-use foundation models with widely available weights” and said they needed further study. Weights are numerical parameters that influence how an AI model performs.“When the weights for a dual-use foundation model are widely available — such as when they are publicly posted on the Internet — there can be substantial benefits to innovation, but also substantial security risks, such as the removal of safeguards within the model,” Biden's order said. He gave U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo until July to talk to experts and come back with recommendations on how to manage the potential benefits and risks.",5870,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/ais-future-open-source-closed-tech-giants-divided-105378396,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d78ec321-9205-494f-96c8-e15c430a2561/wirestory_dd61e99ac8135b36872b3987601067ec_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,july contribute feed share stanford innovation linux model formerly current draw discovery openai tech company detail restriction social code team powerful practice rule ilya division press learn culture despite depend make scientific ammunition microsoft advocate simply associate alliance oppose talk rival chris build heart secretary longtime decade incentive fundamentally worry global commercial dispute decidedly vice back lock scholar technology free chipmakers intel watch security scenario discussion tuesday hard artificial sweep ibm massive approach define evan accessible precedes election frontier irresponsible internet sony long executive system padilla described corporate knowledge describe debate software computer twitter operating window constitute critic regulatory regulate leader group hand sutskever manage instance ban science camp work capture building early form intelligence pose involves numerical partner key state broadly humane gina potential democratic information weight write movie profit disagree platform foundation host safety darío fearmongering leak removal start danger disinformation harris joe launch put power doomsday scientist safeguard google startup reason barrel ramp source dimension call poise biden differ favor office exchange senior longer study give anthropic different benefit technical competition public influence x component capability future similar proprietary easy interview oppenheimer reflect center gil directs post ahead articulate odds top california deploy april president guardrail underlie raimondo amd posit lecun dangerous involve david open big wrong modify disrupt built vocal biological entirety examine repository adopt research human parent place fear broader chief available affair confusion case video limit supporter camille freely miss expert campaign compete publicly parameter obvious attention raise highly close yann lobbying classic emerge university order industry berkeley meta include chatgpt risk worried widely program diverge government commerce openness development idea increasingly lead completely proponent fellow great aim sort term medium lot concentrate substantial fall recommendation,0.82205,0.4088586030664395,10.945461323392358,0.4398930535006484,0,2023-12-05
ABC,Schools are sending more kids to the hospital,2023-12-05 00:05:00,ANNIE MA OF Associated Press and MEREDITH KOLODNER OF THE HECHINGER REPORT Associated Press,"SALISBURY, Md. -- Three times a week, on average, a police car pulls up to a school in Wicomico County on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. A student is brought out, handcuffed and placed inside for transport to a hospital emergency room for a psychiatric evaluation.Over the past eight years, the process has been used at least 750 times on students. Some are as young as 5 years old.The state law that allows for these removals, known as petitions for emergency evaluation, is meant to be limited to people with severe mental illness, who are endangering their own lives or safety or someone else’s. It’s the first step toward getting someone involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital.But advocates say schools across the country are sending children to the emergency room for psychiatric evaluations in response to behaviors prompted by bullying or frustration over assignments. The ER trips, they say, often follow months, and sometimes years, of their needs not being met.Black students are more frequently subjected to these removals than their peers, according to available data. Advocates point to students with disabilities also being removed at higher rates.“Schools focus on keeping kids out rather than on keeping kids in,” said Dan Stewart, managing attorney at the National Disability Rights Network. “I think that’s the fundamental crux of things.”Schools in Wicomico County agreed not to misuse emergency petitions as part of a 2017 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. But while the number of suspensions and expulsions declined, mandated trips to the emergency room ticked up.Last year, children were handcuffed and sent to the emergency room at least 117 times from Wicomico schools, about once per every 100 students, according to data obtained from public records requests to the Wicomico County Sheriff’s Office.At least 40% were 12 or younger. More than half were Black children, even though a little more than a third of Wicomico public school children are Black.In interviews, dozens of students, parents, educators, lawyers and advocates for students with disabilities in Wicomico County said a lack of resources and trained staff, combined with a punitive culture in some schools, are behind the misuse of emergency petitions.One Wicomico mom, who asked for anonymity because she feared retaliation from the school, recalled the terror she felt when her son’s school called and said they were going to have him assessed for a forced psychiatric hospitalization. When she arrived at the school, she said, her son was already in handcuffs. He was put in the back of a police car and taken to the hospital.“He said his wrists hurt from the handcuffs,” the mother said. “He was just really quiet, just sitting there, and he didn’t understand why he was in the hospital.”The practice isn’t just happening in Wicomico.Recent data shows New York City schools still call police to take children in emotional distress to the emergency room despite a 2014 legal settlement in which they agreed to stop the practice.A Kentucky school district was found to have used a psychiatric assessment on kids more than 1,000 times in a year. In Florida, thousands of school-aged children have been subjected to the Baker Act, the state’s involuntary commitment statute.In a settlement with the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights, the Stockton Unified School District in California agreed to protocols that require other interventions before referring students with disabilities for psychiatric evaluation.In Maryland, Wicomico uses emergency petitions more often per capita than almost every other Maryland district where data is available.Baltimore City, for example, last year had 271 emergency petitions from schools, compared with Wicomico’s at least 117, according to data obtained from law enforcement agencies through public records requests. But Baltimore’s student population is five times as large.Wicomico parents describe struggling to get support for their children when they fell behind on basics like reading and math in early grades. These gaps in learning can lead to frustration and behaviors challenging for teachers to manage.The Wicomico mother whose son was handcuffed said she fought for years with administrators to obtain accommodations for her child, who is autistic, an experience echoed by other parents. Her son, who also has ADHD, was several years behind in reading by the time he got to middle school. The mother said he was sent to the hospital after an outburst rooted in frustration, not mental illness.She recalled school officials telling her, “‘He doesn’t have special needs, he just has anger issues.’ They were trying to get him out of the school.”Her son had grown increasingly discouraged and agitated over an assignment he was unable to complete, she said. The situation escalated, she said, when the teacher argued with him. He knocked a laptop on his desk to the floor, and the school called for an emergency petition. After being taken to the hospital in handcuffs, he was examined and released.“After that, he went from angry to terrified,” she said. “Every time he saw the police, he would start panicking.”A spokeswoman from the Wicomico County Public Schools said emergency petitions “are used in the most extreme, emergency situations where the life and safety of the student or others are at risk.”“(Emergency petitions) are not used for disciplinary purposes and frequently do not result from a student’s behaviors,” Tracy Sahler said in an email. “In fact, a majority of EPs are related to when a student exhibits suicidal ideation or plans self-harm.”School officials did not respond to questions about why the rate of emergency petitions was so much higher in Wicomico than in other counties in Maryland. The Sheriff’s Department declined to share records that would show the reasons for the removals.By law, certain classroom removals must be recorded. Suspensions, expulsions and arrests are the most commonly documented indicators of racial disparities in discipline. Schools are required by law to publicly report the data, which often triggers oversight and investigations.But with the exceptions of Florida and New York City, most places do not routinely collect information on removals from school for psychiatric assessments.Without that data, there is no way to hold schools accountable, said Daniel Losen, senior director for the education team at the National Center for Youth Law.“The civil rights of children is at stake, because it’s more likely it’s going to be Black kids and kids with disabilities who are subjected to all kinds of biases that deny them an educational opportunity,” he said.Families who have experienced emergency petitions say educators who can communicate with their child are stretched thin, and measures that could de-escalate a situation are not always taken. The day her son was sent to the hospital, the mother recalled, the administrator who had consistently advocated for him was out of the building.In another instance, a middle schooler said the required accommodations for his learning and behavioral disabilities included taking a walk with a trusted educator when he became agitated. The day he was involuntarily sent to the hospital, that staff member was unavailable. He began yelling and spitting when an administrator blocked him from leaving on his own. He said that by the time police arrived, he was calm and sitting in the principal’s office. Still, he was handcuffed and taken to the hospital, where he was examined and released a few hours later.Because emergency petitions happen outside the standard discipline process, missed school days are not recorded as suspensions. For students with disabilities, that has special consequences – they are not supposed to be removed from class for more than 10 days without an evaluation of whether they are receiving the support they need.“If you use the discipline process, and you’re a student with a disability, your rights kick in,” said Selene Almazan, legal director for the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates.In many places around the country, the resources needed to support students with disabilities are scarce.On Maryland’s Eastern Shore, lawyers and advocates for families said the spectrum of alternatives for students is limited by both money and geography. Those can include private, out-of-district placements and specialized classrooms for specific needs like dyslexia, for example.In cases where children need targeted services unavailable in the local district, the district must allow them to be educated outside the school system — and pay for it.“You’re stuck between a rock and a hard place because you’re like, ‘This kid needs more services,’ but you can’t get the school to agree,” said Angela Ford, clinical director at Maple Shade Youth and Family Services, which serves children with emotional and behavioral disabilities in Wicomico.The 2017 settlement with the Justice Department required the Wicomico district to reduce the significant racial and disability-related disparities in suspensions, placements in alternative schools and other discipline measures.The district agreed not to use emergency petitions “where less intrusive interventions … can be implemented to address the behavioral concern” and not to use them “to discipline or punish or to address lack of compliance with directions.”But since the settlement, many parents, teachers and community leaders said the district has seemed more concerned with keeping suspension numbers down than providing support for teachers to help prevent disruptive behavior.“If we know how to handle and deal with behaviors, then we will have less EPs,” said Anthony Mann, who was an instructional aide at Wicomico County High School last year and is a Wicomico public school parent.Tatiyana Jackson, who has a son with a disability at Wicomico Middle School, agrees teachers need more training. “I don’t think they have a lot of patience or tolerance for children with differences. It’s like they give up on them.”Wicomico school officials said ongoing professional development for staff includes the appropriate use of emergency petitions.“Each school has a well-trained team that includes a social worker and school counselor, with the support of school psychologists,” said Sahler. “All supports that may be beneficial to assist the student are utilized. However, the safety of the student is paramount and the determining factor is ensuring that there is no unnecessary delay in obtaining aid for the student.”But Denise Gregorius, who taught in Wicomico schools for over a decade and left in 2019, questioned the feasibility of the discipline and behavior strategies taught during professional development.What the teachers really want, she said, is more support.After the settlement, which had a two-and-a-half year monitoring period, the number of suspensions and expulsions in Wicomico declined markedly – for Black and white students. But the number of emergency petitions, which don’t appear in state statistics, has ticked up.Other measures of exclusionary discipline remained high, including school arrests. In 2021-22, Wicomico had 210 school-based arrests – the second highest number in the state, while they were 15th in student enrollment. More than three-quarters of the children arrested were Black and 80% were students with disabilities.“Monitoring the numbers doesn’t bring you the solution,” said Losen, from the National Center for Youth Law. In many districts, “the problem is more than what they’re doing with discipline.”The Department of Justice declined to comment.Some Wicomico parents and educators point to an insular culture in the school district where problems are hidden rather than resolved.They are frustrated that there is no relationship with the county’s mobile crisis unit, which is often relied on in other counties to help de-escalate issues instead of calling the police.Jermichael Mitchell, a community organizer who is an alum and parent in Wicomico County Schools, said educators often do not know how to empathize and respond to the trauma and unmet needs that may lead to children’s behavior.“A Black kid that’s truly going through something, that truly needs support, is always looked at as a threat,” he said. “You don’t know how those kids have been taught to cry out for help. You don’t know the trauma that they’ve been through.”Studies have found Black and Latino children who have a teacher of the same race have fewer suspensions and higher test scores, but that diversity is lacking in Wicomico County. Wicomico schools have the largest gap between the number of students of color and teachers of color in the state.Wicomico school officials said they do not discriminate against any of their students.A Wicomico teenager described a years-long process of becoming alienated from school, with an emergency petition as the ultimate break. He said he was bullied in middle school over a series of months until one day he snapped and hit the student who had been taunting him.The school called the police. He told the officers not to touch him, and that he needed to calm down. Instead, the officers grabbed him and shoved him into the ground, he said. He was handcuffed and transported to the emergency room. But when he returned, he said the only thing that was different was how he felt about the adults in the building.“I got used to not trusting people, not talking to people at school,” he said. “Nothing else really changed.”_____This story about emergency petitions was produced by The Associated Press and The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education._____",13759,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/handcuffed-er-misbehavior-schools-sending-kids-hospital-105378299,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/54d546be-aa4c-4e09-b07b-a86239f5fca0/wirestory_b2ae828a735c50ba562757dfdc7393ca_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,share alienate unnecessary implement country emergency week math large organization law practice deal hospital culture arrive despite inequality frequently maple advocate commitment associate anger decline talk bias argue disparity agitate extreme intrusive remain ticked administrator almazan refer break quiet limited root mann receive data majority ideation thousand room shore official hard service obtain peer unable mother fundamental thin md racial inside meant response caput document return described score markedly daniel describe require eastern agree tracy school assist fell police leader hidden struggle left high punitive placement part purpose laptop paramount found ground angela race lawyer hold distress state mom justice follow fought told anonymity act accommodation news information show kind counselor worker fact complete measure middle dyslexia kid student put indicator half outburst result angry snap hit call civil maryland florida tolerance evaluation senior give interview concern district resource bring behavior retaliation center stewart transport echoed grabbed expulsion wrist california basic alternative council serf hour issue accountable money local disruptive grown geography endanger opportunity mitchell unmet month question monitoring walk request gap settlement determine reading knock brought strategy hechinger ensure parent place fear past misuse available protocol challenge discipline psychiatric year subject beneficial miss publicly aide family director trauma rate concerned educator special instead life suspension assignment increasingly instructional lead handle bully compliance young test desk spokeswoman send adult unit population exclusionary eps behavioral exhibit severe felt innovation report private teenager teacher kentucky rock social terrify assessment team mental sahler press learn taunt rely baltimore cry baker nonprofit adhd combine discourage prevent intervention touch exception jackson decade mobile commit routinely organizer number pull handcuffed back assess agency respond training period difference punish specialized factor wicomico experience schooler illness consistently point aid specific lack stretch support grade escalate class latino unavailable oversight commonly system frustration terror member spectrum trip national consequence force significant stockton educate relationship county hospitalization stop manage unified instance principal collect release situation target early network deny suicidal crux process experienced sheriff leave floor suppose white frustrate yell pay education alum crisis stuck handcuff safety disability independent removal start community happen communicate hurt shade reason ford related gregorius calm selene involuntary denise plan produce story focus office trust ongoing psychologist study time different public dozen solution discriminate officer stake insular color email train classroom trigger problem diversity compare losen recall anthony feasibility department kick car involuntarily black legal address step appropriate record agrees patience standard bullying educational staff reduce arrest examine enforcement york provide city accord prompt mandate disciplinary case autistic statistic salisbury series remove taught understand day begin professional child emotional utilized spit ultimate attorney enrollment include empathize shove development youth block average clinical lot threat delay petition,-0.99705,0.0872156406715604,11.040176919983915,0.3790769003907692,0,2023-12-05
ABC,The fourth GOP debate will be a key moment for the young NewsNation cable network,2023-12-05 00:03:00,DAVID BAUDER AP media writer,"NEW YORK -- By airing the fourth Republican presidential primary debate scheduled for Wednesday — again, minus Donald Trump — the young NewsNation television network will almost certainly reach the largest audience in its history.Yet with two of the three debate moderators associated with conservative media and not NewsNation, including podcast star Megyn Kelly, the event threatens to be at odds with the centrist image the network is trying to cultivate.“I think it's an amazing opportunity and allows us to have more people fully sample the network and see who we are and what we're doing,” said Cherie Grzech, NewsNation's senior vice president of news and politics.Her advice to those who have doubts about how NewsNation can pull it off: Just watch.The debate is to air from 8 to 10 p.m. ET and will also be shown on the CW network, which like NewsNation is owned by the Nexstar Media Group. The CW will show it live in the eastern half of the country, and tape-delayed out West.NewsNation took over for the old WGN America network in late 2020 and has tried to establish itself with personalities who made names for themselves elsewhere: Chris Cuomo from CNN, Dan Abrams of ABC News, Ashleigh Banfield from MSNBC and former Fox News host Leland Vittert.Ratings suggest it's still looking for an audience — and has a way to go. NewsNation averaged 99,000 viewers in prime time in November, compared to Fox News Channel's 1.73 million, MSNBC's 1.14 million, CNN's 540,000 and Newsmax's 207,000, the Nielsen company said.The network bills itself as an unbiased alternative to competitors with more hardened partisan images. Abrams told the Hollywood Reporter that NewsNation's sweet spot is the “marginalized moderate majority who don't want hyper-partisan outlets.”Critics, like the liberal media watchdog Media Matters, suggest NewsNation leans more right than down the middle. A Daily Beast writer who watched the network for a week this fall, Joe Berkowitz, had a similar view, writing that “left-leaning voices are heard on NewsNation rarely, briefly and cursorily — as if to tick a box.”The network's ranks include several Fox News alums, including Grzech and Chris Stirewalt, its politics editor. Former Fox executive Bill Shine is a consultant.Grzech suggested that those critics haven't watched NewsNation much. “I don't see that. and it isn't the experience I've had here at all,” she said.In awarding the rights to televise Wednesday's debate, the Republican National Committee chose the debate moderators. The one with NewsNation ties is Elizabeth Vargas, formerly of ABC News, who hosts an evening newscast on the network. Eliana Johnson of the conservative site Washington Free Beacon was also selected.The headliner, though, is Kelly. Working with Kelly is a throwback for Grzech; they did debate prep together when both were at Fox. Kelly's experience working debates during the 2016 Republican presidential nominating process shot her to fame through her feud with Trump.Kelly signed a big free agent contract with NBC News but that didn't work out, and she negotiated an exit when her 2018 suggestion that it was OK for white people to wear blackface on Halloween caused a furor.She's since remade herself as a podcast and radio star, much more publicly opinionated than before, and is taking a role as a debate moderator that has traditionally been filled by impartial journalists.It's not like Kelly hasn't done it before. But, in her new job, she hasn't been shy about offering opinions on the people who will be debating.She's criticized Ron DeSantis for taking on the Walt Disney Corp. in Florida and said of him during a debate in September on social media, “Seriously, Ron DeSantis, you do not need to smile the whole debate. Whoever told you that misled you.”Kelly called Nikki Haley's announcement of her presidential candidacy “cringy.” On X, formerly Twitter, she posted: “Is it just me, or has (Chris) Christie lost a little off his fastball?” She posted “you've got to be kidding me” in response to one of Vivek Ramaswamy's X messages in October.And during one of the debates on Fox, she posted, “I'm bored.”“I think there's an argument to be had about whether she's a journalist anymore,” said Tom Jones, senior media writer at the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank. “My concern if I was NewsNation is that Megyn Kelly is going to come in with her own agenda and turn this debate upside down.”Jones said he admired how Kelly has remade her career, “but I don't know if the job she does now necessarily qualifies her to be a moderator for a debate.”Kelly, through a representative, declined an interview request.It is a Republican debate, and there's an argument to be made that figures in the conservative media would be more attuned to what potential GOP primary voters want to hear about. But could that also mean avoiding legitimate topics because they might make a Republican audience uncomfortable? To that end, Grezch said that questions about Trump, the missing debater and leader in the polls, are legitimate.How NewsNation handles its moment in the spotlight becomes clear Wednesday night.___",5148,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/fourth-gop-debate-key-moment-young-newsnation-cable-105378302,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c41c665c-26de-4b2e-b53e-4c18b38bf1c1/wirestory_9e93b815985f5e47b91a682bc3617cdf_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,formerly country hear cnn company opinion social week poynter qualifies large make smile associate wear turn megyn decline audience poll agent briefly walt competitor chris rarely image debater admire sign tie live pull advice johnson role prep vice newscast headliner elizabeth free majority watch washington nominate message institute shy experience kelly suggestion candidacy million spot negotiate stirewalt republican reporter cuomo agenda lean executive response editor beast reach fully anymore writer liberal upside bill debate national abc leland eastern award twitter desantis christie critic heard group leader banfield prime tank wednesday september necessarily tom work contract nielsen traditionally fox network matter berkowitz process halloween jones white potential told ramaswamy news shine show blackface alum write shot avoid conservative host cherie middle moderator joe figure kid centrist half feud fame sample nikki chose remade grzech legitimate amaze uncomfortable threatens televise clear call florida watchdog former schedule disney senior time career beacon cw tick voter eliana x spotlight hollywood late similar ron nexstar interview concern throwback announcement rank view msnbc compare voice post moderate odds opinionated fourth representative harden alternative exit president site minus marginalize attune unbiased partisan opportunity america donald ashleigh viewer big gop topic argument sweet question event channel vargas establish york criticize haley fastball abrams mislead miss presidential vivek publicly podcast newsmax star suggest air television trump politics moment committee daily include newsnation impartial journalist wgn grezch cursorily radio handle nbc journalism job fill young average offering medium primary personality fall lose november doubt,0.26785,0.0,9.614057377049178,0.4275426341335432,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Miss Manners: Should I stop sending Christmas cards if people don’t reciprocate?,2023-12-05 00:00:00,Judith Martin,"Dear Miss Manners: Over the years, I’ve maintained a special fondness for the act of writing and addressing Christmas cards to about 50 friends (old and new) and family members. I find taking a moment to think of valued relationships, even if only once a year, to be heartwarming and restorative.However, in recent years, more and more recipients of my cards have let it be known that they no longer engage in the activity. This has raised concerns that, by sending cards to those who don’t do likewise, I may be implying that I expect them to reciprocate. (I don’t!)Should I take note of people from whom I don’t receive a card and stop sending mine to them?It is not surprising that this way of keeping in touch annually with people whom one might not often see has declined. So many people now make a constant effort to reach everyone they know — and anyone they don’t know — that they dismiss this practice as quaint.Besides, they may maintain that the requirement of writing something out by hand and perhaps even adding a personal comment — mass-produced cards with printed names do not count — is an imposition.So Miss Manners agrees that you should confine your list to those who will appreciate the charm. This group may include people who don’t send Christmas cards themselves but use some other personal way of keeping in occasional touch. And by that, Miss Manners means something more than sending you their selfies taken on vacation. But you should set your own standard.Dear Miss Manners: What is the correct acknowledgment for Christmas cards? I mean the ones where people create cards with family photos. Is acknowledgment required at all? Would a text suffice?“You all look adorable in your matching pajamas, and so does the dog,” along with your good wishes. And yes, if you don’t send cards, Miss Manners will allow you to dispatch the message otherwise.Dear Miss Manners: When dining in someone’s home, the food is often served buffet-style so each guest can fill their own dinner plate.My husband will bypass certain foods because he does not particularly like them. He is not allergic, nor does he find these foods revolting or otherwise distasteful. He just doesn’t enjoy them.In this situation, I believe one must sample every food the host has thoughtfully prepared — first, because menu items are chosen because they go well together, and second, because of the considerable time and effort that goes into preparing food.In my view, it is polite to enjoy the meal as the host intended and compliment accordingly. My husband, on the other hand, thinks there is no such politeness required. He feels he shouldn’t have to put something on his plate unless he likes it.Please help us resolve this difference of opinion.He wins.Dear Miss Manners: On wedding invitations, is there a difference between “the pleasure of your company” and “the honor of your presence”?Yes: The latter is used if the ceremony is held in a house of worship; the former if it is held elsewhere.New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Washington Post,Ask Amy: My friend is in a better place now. Can I end the friendship?,2023-12-05 00:00:00,Amy Dickinson,"Dear Amy: I made friends with “Bruce” at a yoga class about 10 years ago. We’d meet for classes and then grab dinner. I moved away about a year into the friendship, and we lost touch.Just before the pandemic, Bruce was visiting the city where I lived and looked me up. We grabbed dinner, and he told me he had no close friends (his previous friends had ghosted him) and that he had considered suicide. I told him to get in touch any time, and that he was welcome to visit. I also told him to seek help.He took me up on the offer and started visiting every two or three months (including on Christmas and for his birthday) — and stayed for two or three days each time. We didn’t have much to talk about. Bruce was fussy and demanding, and frankly, I hated the visits, but I felt responsible. He also complained nonstop about his family and co-workers. It sounded like he’d also complained to them about me.Now I’ve moved back to the city where Bruce still lives. He’s made more friends, is closer to his family, has a girlfriend, and seems well. When I meet him now, though, he still complains nonstop about everyone in his life, reporting petty slights and missteps — and I just nod and listen.How can I end this friendship? Do I owe it to him to remain in the friendship since he confided in me about his depression? I’m wondering whether just pulling away (being busy when he wants to meet) is kinder than telling him the reasons.Your advice?— Downward Facing FriendDownward: You seem to have been an extremely compassionate and patient friend to “Bruce” when he needed you — or seemed to need you. You seem also to have never placed any boundaries around your relationship with him.You took his mentioning the possibility of depression and suicide as a cry for help, and you did your very best to help him through a dark time in his life. However, you don’t report that you are a clinician or mental health professional; this is an extremely heavy burden for a friend to carry.You don’t say whether he ever received professional help, but Bruce may have used the opportunities to vent and temporarily relieve his own anxieties with you as a reason to avoid getting other help. Because of the combination of Bruce’s manipulations and your challenges creating boundaries, I do suggest a slow backing away. Yes — be busy.If he confronts or pushes you, congratulate him on creating a healthier and happier life. Encourage him to continue. You might do some work on your own to learn new ways to create and maintain healthy boundaries.Dear Amy: I have a common question, but now that it has come up in my own household, it feels unique to our family.Before having children, my wife and I agreed that I would be the stay-at-home parent and she would continue with her career.Fortunately, she has a fulfilling career that also pays enough to fully support our household.When we adopted our first child, I left my job and stayed home. It worked out well.Now we have two young children. My wife’s career has also intensified. She works hard and finds her career fulfilling.The issue is about what happens when she gets home.She’s great with the kids but has stated that basically all of the work related to the children and our home should fall onto me.The way I see it, her idea is that she should work 40 to 50 hours a week at her career, and I should work 168 hours a week at … everything else.What is the right balance?— Weary WivesWeary: In my opinion, the most balanced arrangement is that your job is to 100 percent maintain hearth and children during the hours when your wife is working outside the home.When your wife comes home, your workload there should decrease to 50 percent, and hers should increase to 50 percent.Dear Amy: “Taken Aback” wrote that her parents were considering opening their marriage, and she couldn’t figure out why her mother had told her this.If her parents are truly interested in polyamory, her mother might have been trying to prepare her for the possibility of other people becoming part of the family.— EE: I think of “open marriage” more as pursuing various partners and polyamory as more permanent family-bonding, but you could be right about this.",4184,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/12/05/ask-amy-end-friendship-negativity/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dinner felt report confide owe responsible complain opinion week dear mental sound maintain learn depression extremely make ee cry bruce healthier talk seek anxiety continue previous remain touch compassionate frankly live pull nonstop advice pursue back friend receive nod offer hard dark mother decrease healthy suicide support push class happier birthday confronts wife petty fully agree christmas relationship manipulation health kinder downward left intensified visit part work misstep arrangement hearth mention partner state move slow frienddownward told congratulate closer pay wivesweary write avoid prepare complains start figure kid reason yoga backing polyamory related combination girlfriend unique wonder temporarily time career vent marriage increase create household consider basically heavy find home meet permanent demand grabbed hour issue ago relieve opening possibility boundary slight opportunity open busy encourage month ghost question common adopt city parent place away percent challenge day year burden professional child suggest close fulfil family fussy stayed pandemic welcome include feel life aback idea patient workload weary balance job young great clinician grab interested amy fall lose friendship reporting,0.97885,0.0717017208413001,7.387109004739337,0.4668364598364599,0,2023-12-05
Washington Post,Carolyn Hax: Mom already under-saves but wants to give cash to the grandkids,2023-12-05 00:00:00,Carolyn Hax,"Adapted from an online discussion.Dear Carolyn: My mom, who is retired and on a fixed income, recently gave my kids (through me) a very large check “just because.” I know I should be grateful, but I’m not. My mom has been terrible with money her entire life. If she is able to live independently, there’s a slight chance she won’t outlive her savings. But if she needs a higher level of care, which I think she will in the coming months, she’ll run out of money very soon.She keeps asking if I’ve given the kids the money. I haven’t, because it’s a huge source of stress for me. I know grandparents like to spoil their kids. But this is well beyond typical grandparent spoiling.In the next year or so when her money runs out, I am going to need to make some tough decisions about our family’s money and how much we will contribute to her care. Decisions like: Do I pay for my kids’ college, my mom’s memory care or my own retirement? So I’d rather she keep this money for herself, and not give it to my kids to blow on Funko Pop figurines. And now she is really hurt that I’m not more excited about this gift. Am I the jerk here?— StressedStressed: Tough one. The short answer is no, you aren’t a jerk for being mindful of the fallout from your mother’s poor judgment. And no, you “should” not be grateful.But I think a practical answer would be more useful. Can you put this money into education-savings accounts for your kids? Then you can say yes to having given it to them, but you’d still have it for when things get hairy — which seems imminent no matter what she does with her loose cash now, unless you’re talking high-five-figure giveaways.Readers’ thoughts:· Buy your kids something inexpensive so they can say thank you to Grandma. Stash the rest away against that future you are dreading. It may not come, and then this can be a college/vocational training nest egg.· The gift may mean a delay of Medicaid eligibility. This is the sort of thing an elder lawyer consults on.Dear Carolyn: What to do if you like or love one of your three grandchildren more than the others? They are only 1 and 3 years old, so really not their fault, and I am embarrassed about my feelings.— GrandmaGrandma: It wouldn’t be their fault if they were 11 and 13, would it? Or 21 and 23?Anyway. You hold it in your heart as your secret, and embrace it as your duty to make sure none of the grandkids is ever the wiser. Certainly not because of anything you consciously do.Preferences are normal. Nothing to be embarrassed about. Just cultivate connections with all, and make it your guiding principle that each child deserves your best.Readers’ thoughts:· It might be helpful to frame it in your mind as, “I like this stage of childhood,” rather than, “I like this grandchild better.” Their personalities are going to change many times as they grow up, so you may at any given time like one or the other better.",2899,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/12/05/carolyn-hax-give-cash-grandkids/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,wiser contribute judgment elder source huge grandmagrandma stash large pop give time entire make talk future spoil inexpensive grow heart embrace live fix chance account stage fallout eligibility deserves carolyn training embarrass change love typical college loose grateful money consciously grandchild decision principle mother tough slight run month excite grandparent stress dread retirement stressedstressed normal jerk online duty terrible away cash secret funko independently mindful retire memory rest helpful year connection nest high grandma child recently practical outlive family matter guide level lawyer hairy hold income short figurine saving check mom life blow adapt mind pay answer gift sort frame grandkids imminent fault cultivate consults childhood personality buy delay kid poor put medicaid hurt,0.2401499999999999,0.1034839599862021,5.120758293838858,0.4936315338101052,0,2023-12-05
ABC,"More bodies found after surprise eruption of Indonesia's Mount Marapi, raising apparent toll to 23",2023-12-04 23:26:00,MARDI ROSA TANJUNG Associated Press,"BATU PALANO, Indonesia -- Rescuers searching the hazardous slopes of Indonesia's Mount Marapi volcano found more bodies among the climbers caught by a surprise eruption two days ago, raising the number of confirmed and presumed dead to 23.More than 50 climbers were rescued after the initial eruption Sunday, and 11 others were initially confirmed dead. Another eruption Monday spewed a new burst of hot ash as high as 800 meters (2,620 feet) into the air and temporarily halted search operations.The latest bodies were found not too far from the eruption site, estimated to be only a few meters (yards) away, said Edi Mardianto, the deputy police chief in West Sumatra province. The bodies of five climbers have been recovered, and 18 are presumed dead because they were so close to the eruption of hot gases and ash.“The rest we want to evacuate are 18 and we expect they are no longer alive. The team will evacuate and take them to the hospital tomorrow or today to be identified,” Mardianto said Tuesday.The rescuers are contending with bad weather and terrain constraints, as the scouring wind brings heat from the eruptions.A video released by West Sumatra’s Search and Rescue Agency showed rescuers evacuating an injured climber on a stretcher off the mountain and into a waiting ambulance to be taken to hospital.Marapi has stayed at the third highest of four alert levels since 2011, a level indicating above-normal volcanic activity, prohibiting climbers and villagers within 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) of the peak, according to Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation.Climbers were only allowed below the danger zone, and they had to register at two command posts or online. However, local officials acknowledged many people may have climbed higher than permitted and residents also could have been in the area, making the number of people stranded by the eruption impossible to confirm.Marapi spewed thick columns of ash as high as 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) in Sunday's eruption and hot ash clouds spread for several kilometers (miles). Nearby villages and towns were blanketed by tons of volcanic debris that blocked sunlight, and authorities recommending people wear masks and eyeglasses if possible to protect themselves from the ash.About 1,400 people live on Marapi’s slopes in Rubai and Gobah Cumantiang, the nearest villages about 5 to 6 kilometers (3.1 to 3.7 miles) from the peak.Marapi was known for having sudden eruptions that are difficult to detect because the source is shallow and near the peak, and its eruptions are not caused by deep movement of magma, which sets off tremors that register on seismic monitors.Marapi has been active since a January eruption that caused no casualties. It is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.___",2955,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/bodies-found-after-surprise-eruption-indonesias-mount-marapi-105377403,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/fb4f4df6-b69f-413a-8ba9-17797c55de08/wirestory_fe1ec3fff730eb19a4940e55e85300cb_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,today sunday alert movement kilometer source thick village meter ambulance alive initial temporarily team spew mount foot hospital longer confirm gas make expect wear shallow rubai late nearby heat rescuer marapi hazardous register center scour post number live sunlight mardianto volcano strand seismic geological upheaval mask detect eruption agency active site debris villager ago local evacuate permit recover pacific prone official slope climber prohibit ash town brings recommend province difficult tomorrow protect volcanology initially mile contend set edi possible online injured peak area january accord volcanic blanket chief wind halt mountain indonesia activity yard search away west magma wait disaster location caught video resident weather line police authority rest day due high acknowledge raise release stretcher air cloud close arc fire sumatra eyeglass casualty found batu terrain stayed surprise level climbed ring identify encircle body estimate constraint indicate column deep spread show sudden block gobah cumantiang fault palano tremor burst zone hot deputy rescue presume dead danger command monday impossible,-0.92275,0.1015228426395939,11.289735849056605,0.5675303030303029,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Former Harvard disinformation scholar says she was pushed out of her job after college faced pressure from Facebook,2023-12-04 23:00:00,Donie O'Sullivan,"A nationally recognized online disinformation researcher has accused Harvard University of shutting down the project she led to protect its relationship with mega-donor and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.The allegations, made by Dr. Joan Donovan, raise questions about the influence the tech giant might have over seemingly independent research. Facebook’s parent company Meta has long sought to defend itself against research that implicates it in harming society: from the proliferation of election disinformation to creating addictive habits in children. Details of the disclosure were first reported by The Washington Post.Beginning in 2018, Donovan worked for the Shorenstein Center at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, and ran its Technology and Social Change Research Project, where she led studies of media manipulation campaigns. But last year Harvard informed Donovan it was shutting the project down, Donovan claims.In a disclosure sent last week to Harvard leaders and US Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and made public on Monday, Donovan alleges that the University began restricting her research after the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative donated $500 million to fund a new university-wide center on artificial intelligence. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is the philanthropy run by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, who both attended Harvard.Harvard is strongly disputing Dr. Donovan’s claims. James Francis Smith, a spokesperson for the university said in a statement to CNN Monday, “allegations of unfair treatment and donor interference are false. The narrative is full of inaccuracies and baseless insinuations, particularly the suggestion that Harvard Kennedy School allowed Facebook to dictate its approach to research.”“By longstanding policy to uphold academic standards, all research projects at Harvard Kennedy School need to be led by faculty members. Joan Donovan was hired as a staff member (not a faculty member) to manage a media manipulation project. When the original faculty leader of the project left Harvard, the School tried for some time to identify another faculty member who had time and interest to lead the project. After that effort did not succeed, the project was given more than a year to wind down. Joan Donovan was not fired, and most members of the research team chose to remain at the School in new roles,” he said.He added that Harvard continues to research misinformation and social media’s role in it, pointing out Harvard hosts and made available to the public the Facebook documents leaked by former Facebook employee Frances Haugen in a separate whistleblower complaint in October 2021, known as the “Facebook Papers.” Harvard also runs an academic journal on misinformation.The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative said it had no involvement in Donovan’s departure from Harvard.“CZI … was unaware of that development before public reporting on it,” a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative spokesperson said in a statement.Meta declined to comment. CNN has also reached out to the US Department of Education. The Massachusetts Attorney General’s office said it had received the disclosure and was reviewing it.The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative donation came shortly after Haugen’s blockbuster complaint, the disclosure states. Following the release of the Facebook Papers, Donovan was involved in an effort to help archive the documents and make them publicly available to researchers, students, policymakers and journalists.“This is a shocking betrayal of Harvard’s academic integrity and the public interest,” Libby Liu, the CEO of Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal group that previously worked with the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.The disclosure, which was sent on Donovan’s behalf by Whistleblower Aid and is addressed to Harvard President Claudine Gay, Harvard General Counsel and Vice President Diane Lopez and Cardona, seeks an investigation into the Kennedy School’s activity and “all appropriate corrective action” to protect academic freedom.“We’ve seen in the past how Big Tobacco, Big Energy and Big Pharma have succeeded in influencing, undermining, and co-opting research to protect their lies, their profits and evade accountability. Now Meta, with the complicity of a powerful ally, is following the same playbook,” Liu said. “Whether Harvard acted at the company’s direction or took the initiative on their own to protect Meta’s interests, the outcome is the same: corporate interests are undermining research and academic freedom to the detriment of the public.”Donovan joined the Shorenstein Center in 2018. During Donovan’s time at Harvard, the center released research reports about online Covid-19 and other medical misinformation campaigns; Donovan published the book “Meme Wars” about how far-right actors use online memes to undermine American democracy; and Donovan testified before House and Senate subcommittees about online misinformation and how social media algorithms can shape societal discourse. Donovan has also frequently been cited as an expert in online information manipulation in news reports, including by CNN.In February, the student-led Harvard Crimson reported that the Kennedy School was ending Donovan’s Technology and Social Change Project and restricting Donovan from raising new funding or conducting additional hiring. At the time, the school pointed to a rule that required such projects to be led by faculty members, which Donovan was not.In August, Donovan announced that she would join Boston University’s College of Communication as an assistant professor, officially ending her affiliation with Harvard Kennedy School. She told the Crimson that she “had to leave” because she felt the Kennedy School “didn’t back me as a scholar.”This story has been updated with additional developments.",5818,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/tech/facebook-disinformation-whistleblower/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/191029113418-donie-osullivan.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,felt longstanding report liu august complicity tech interest haugen cnn company detail social week czi shortly team powerful unfair rule democracy make energy actor frequently decline chan shorenstein seek continue nonprofit founder alleges remain sought secretary claudine american shock misinformation role dispute vice back restrict archive receive february technology college washington involvement artificial suggestion donation succeed priscilla approach aid million general point investigation run medical complaint accountability protect paper freedom election accuse wife effort long shut document online france assistant john reach corporate member wind require activity relationship manipulation school giant initiative leader hire group employee lie faculty left insinuation manage release work join fire policy defend integrity algorithm intelligence full betrayal departure philanthropy leave state previously follow told testify act implicates baseless news information dictate subcommittee education statement crimson profit host independent leak disinformation inaccuracy monday academic student treatment attend habit blockbuster spokesperson chose fund addictive playbook societal october narrative donovan story announce former office james study outcome give time action boston book public influence create libby ally ceo nationally kennedy particularly center comment department lopez legal address president appropriate mark change policymakers inform donate affiliation additional standard add involve massachusetts meme big false allegation question staff facebook gay conduct zuckerberg communication pharma smith research parent funding journal diane past available separate harvard claim officially house miguel year original begin campaign expert corrective publish publicly child seemingly raise tobacco behalf harm ran university evade unaware attorney uphold researcher strongly identify meta proliferation include direction francis government shape discourse society development lead whistleblower project donor update medium counsel disclosure cardona interference senate undermine recognize professor detriment review reporting joan,0.6012500000000001,0.1546923341354417,12.800601202404804,0.2988169364881695,0,2023-12-04

ABC,Alicia Keys' semi-autobiographical stage musical 'Hell's Kitchen' moves to Broadway in spring,2023-12-04 22:10:00,MARK KENNEDY AP entertainment writer,"NEW YORK -- Broadway audiences will soon be hearing the hit songs of Alicia Keys — not far from where the multiple-Grammy-winner grew up.“Hell's Kitchen,” the semi-autobiographical musical by the singer-songwriter, is making the move uptown from off-Broadway to the Shubert Theatre this spring.“I loved going to the theater and I was inspired by it and the songwriting and the expression and the beauty and the way you could be transported,” she tells The Associated Press. “But I never really put it together that maybe one day I would be able to have a debut on Broadway.”Performances begin March 28 with an opening set for April 20. Tickets are on sale Dec. 11. No casting news was revealed but Maleah Joi Moon was the lead off-Broadway.The musical features Keys’ best-known hits: “Fallin’,” “No One,” “Girl on Fire,” “If I Ain’t Got You,” and, of course, “Empire State of Mind,” as well as four new songs.The coming-of-age story about a gifted teenager is by playwright Kristoffer Diaz, a Pulitzer Prize finalist for “The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity.” It is directed by Michael Greif, who also helmed “Dear Evan Hansen,” and has choreography by Camille A. Brown.“Hell’s Kitchen"" centers on 17-year-old Ali, who like Keys, is the daughter of a white mother and a Black father and is about growing up in a subsidized housing development just outside Times Square in the once-rough neighborhood called Hell's Kitchen. Keys is also the lead producer.Keys notes that her mother moved to New York City from Toledo, Ohio, and studied at New York University, eventually acting on stage, in independent films and TV projects. Keys also went into acting before music snatched her away. “Hell's Kitchen,” in a way, is a full-circle moment for the Keys' family.“Dreams come around for you — they might not come for you exactly when you thought it was going to come for you. But they do. They find their way,” she says.Reviews of the musical were kind, with The New Yorker calling it “frequently exhilarating” to Variety saying it is a “sparkling story paying homage to New York” and The Guardian calling it “surprisingly loose-limbed and rousing.”Keys says the show may undergo a few tweaks here and there to prepare for a larger stage, but the bones of the show are strong.“Surely pieces of it will continue to evolve and grow. That’s the beauty of of art,"" she says. ""What I know is intact is the spirit of it. The spirit of it is so pure and so good and it’s so infectious. It is about transformation. It really is about finding who you are.”It will join a glut of recent jukebox musicals on Broadway, a list that includes “A Beautiful Noise: The Neil Diamond Musical,” “& Juliet,” “MJ” and “Moulin Rouge!” One that used the songs of Britney Spears — “Once Upon a One More Time” — closed this fall.This isn't Keys' first flirtation with Broadway. In 2011, she was a co-producer of the Broadway play “Stick Fly,” for which she supplied some music.Keys will join such pop and rock luminaries as Elton John, Cyndi Lauper, Sting, Alanis Morissette, Dave Stewart, Edie Brickell, David Byrne and Fatboy Slim, Bono and The Edge with Broadway scores.___",3145,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/alicia-keys-semi-autobiographical-stage-musical-hells-kitchen-105376695,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a4a53185-7a1b-460e-a3a5-bcf8998bfa99/wirestory_dd968635e08cece242652747e2978045_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,fly cyndi edge teenager daughter rock transformation dear large piece press flirtation theater make slim song frequently subsidize associate audience expression continue prize fallin performance feature brickell fatboy bone bono sparkle pulitzer beautiful snatch finalist dream mother greif spirit songwriting evan surprisingly broadway set theatre dave john play entrance empire musical spear exhilarate moulin join fire alicia yorker father girl key kristoffer white neil state move choreography mind act square news elaborate direct pay show kind undergo debut hell uptown prepare sting ohio independent inspire supply list put rouge juliet lauper hit tweak call story pop toledo beauty study time joi hansen glut grow art britney chad tv find center alanis film stewart transport diaz eventually stage stick guardian homage jukebox black april love mj elton surely opening helm morissette maleah david evolve luminary diamond housing shubert york city reveal march hearing away intact day begin camille michael infectious moon pure neighborhood close music university moment variety kitchen include byrne playwright development cast lead note project course gift ticket edie noise recent,0.99245,0.190779014308426,6.652831325301204,0.4404040404040403,0,2023-12-04
ABC,Regulators begin hearings on how much customers should pay for Georgia nuclear reactors,2023-12-04 19:29:00,JEFF AMY Associated Press,"ATLANTA -- Georgia Power Co. is urging the state's utility regulators to approve a deal to pay for the company's new nuclear reactors as a few holdout opponents keep fighting to try to get the Public Service Commission to keep the utility from collecting any cost overruns for the two reactors at Plant Vogtle.Commissioners began hearings Monday on the proposed deal, which would add $8.95 a month to a typical residential customer's monthly bill, atop the $5.42 that Georgia Power is already collecting. The five elected commissioners, all Republicans, are scheduled to vote on the $7.56 billion proposal on Dec. 19.The increase would raise the current typical monthly residential bill of nearly $157 by almost 6%. The increase would begin in the month after Unit 4 begins commercial operation. Georgia Power says that will happen next spring.The largest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co., Georgia Power announced the deal in August, agreeing with commission staff and some consumer groups. Without the agreement, the company could face months of contentious hearings over how much blame the company should bear for billions in cost overruns at two new nuclear reactors southeast of Augusta.Vogtle’s Unit 3 and Unit 4 are the first new American reactors built from scratch in decades. Each reactor can power 500,000 homes and businesses without releasing any carbon. But even as government officials and some utilities are again looking to nuclear power to alleviate climate change, the cost of Vogtle could discourage utilities from pursuing nuclear power.The project’s overall cost, including financing, is currently $31 billion for Georgia Power and three other owners, Associated Press calculations show. Add in $3.7 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid the Vogtle owners to walk away from construction, and the total nears $35 billion. The reactors are seven years late and $17 billion over budget.Vogtle is projected to cost the company $10.2 billion to build, plus $3.5 billion in financing costs, Georgia Power Chief Financial Officer Aaron Abramovitz testified on Monday. He said the company believes it could have asked the commission to award it $8.83 billion of the construction cost, but instead agreed to seek $7.56 billion.“This strikes an appropriate balance among complex technical issues and provides for the recovery of reasonable and prudent costs for the project,” Abramovitz testified.Groups that reached the agreement with Georgia Power said in August that they believed it was the best deal they could get, saying there was a chance commissioners would have voted for a higher number because they are historically friendly to the utility.But the deal angered remaining opponents. Patty Durand, a Democrat who could challenge Republican Tim Echols, argued in pre-filed testimony that the deal gives away the store and does nothing to hold Georgia Power accountable for its failings. She also argues that the deal is unfairly denying customers a full accounting of management failures in Vogtle’s construction.“Where are the cost disallowances for the failures documented in staff reports?"" Durand asked in written testimony filed before the hearing. ""Where is the study on what went wrong? Where is the bill pay assistance that the largest rate increase in the history of the state should necessitate?”Durand argued that the company should only get the $6.1 billion in construction and financing costs for which it originally promised to build the reactors. And she said it that wasn’t possible, it should at least be the starting point for negotiations.“You don’t start with the worst possible outcome for yourself, which is your opponent’s position, and negotiate down,"" she said. ""That is not a win.”Finally, some opponents including Durand are also arguing that the vote shouldn't take place before elections are held to fill the seats now occupied by Commissioners Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson. Both were scheduled to stand for election in 2022, but balloting was postponed during a court case that sought to make Georgia voters chose commissioners by district. A federal appeals court rejected that move last month.",4159,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/regulators-begin-hearings-customers-pay-georgia-nuclear-reactors-105374183,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,believe durand report current august nears owner plant company balloting large complex deal press unfairly georgia reasonable make associate occupy seek argue accounting discourage regulator management atop build remain sought originally decade american chance number disallowances commercial pursue johnson construction appeal typical proposal scratch financing official paid service point negotiate southeast republican financial holdout election abramovitz overrun document reach contentious finally bill westinghouse agree award group approve carbon high necessitate collect release friendly deny full position hold currently state move total testify pay show postpone write billion reject strike start angered vote testimony bear monday happen power southern chose monthly cost patty vogtle announce schedule climate study outcome give tim history historically technical assistance public increase voter business late aaron officer district home opponent prudent agreement nuclear appropriate change issue consumer accountable argues failure add fitz calculation store held wrong atlanta month built commissioner echols staff walk urge possible file federal provide place chief seat hearing away case challenge recovery year begin original stand court residential customer raise promise rate blame include utility government instead commission alleviate fight democrat failing balance project reactor fill propose operation contractor unit elect,-0.95215,0.0,11.22864064602961,0.4532770890725436,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Festival’s rejection of menorah lighting leads to accusations of antisemitism,2023-12-04 19:18:00,Ellie Silverman,"A rabbi’s proposal to hold a menorah lighting at an upcoming Virginia art and music festival — and its subsequent rejection — has led to accusations of bigotry, alleged threats against the event’s founder, and people on Facebook, national Jewish groups and even Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) weighing in on the controversy.What started as a private conversation between Rabbi Mendy Heber of Chabad Williamsburg and event founder Shirley Vermillion about a potential candle-lighting ceremony has been shared with media outlets — prompting questions about antisemitism and highlighting how, thousands of miles away from the Israel-Gaza war, a Hanukkah menorah has become political.“Singling out the Jewish community by canceling this Hanukkah celebration is absurd and antisemitic,” Youngkin said on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday. “The event organizers should immediately reconsider their actions and move forward with the menorah lighting.”This dispute comes as Israel is expanding its ground operation against Hamas across the Gaza Strip, forcing many displaced civilians to flee again. As the war continues, U.S. federal officials say they have been responding to a rise in threats against Arab, Jewish and Muslim communities thousands of miles away from the conflict.Heber had hoped a menorah lighting this coming Sunday, the fourth night of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, during an arts and music festival in Williamsburg, Va., would be a chance to highlight the message of light amid darkness, without emphasizing religion.The festival occurs on the second Sunday of every month from March to December, with more than 150 artisans, musicians, street performers and food vendors.However, Heber’s proposal was ultimately rejected. Vermillion, the organizer, said in a statement to The Washington Post that the festival has never included religious events and told the Virginia Gazette that the organization has also denied past requests from Christian and other religious groups to perform.She also said in a private message to Heber — which a local Jewish group shared with The Post — that organizers were rejecting the proposal “unless we could get an Islamic group to participate at the same time. We are about Peace, Love & light... don’t want to make it seem we’re choosing a side — supporting the killing/bombing of thousands of men, women & children.”Heber replied: “This would not have anything to do with Israel! Nothing to do with Zionism. Everything to do with adding light in the world.”Ultimately, Vermillion proposed another option: “Our board members said they’d be ok with proceeding if you’d do it under a cease fire banner.”The fallout of their conversation has led to a controversy neither Heber or Vermillion initially anticipated and reflects how Americans are navigating difficult discussions about the Israel-Gaza war with friends, families and neighbors, and damaging relationships in the process.Vermillion, a dental hygienist, was not immediately available for a phone interview on Monday because she was seeing patients at work and then needed to speak with the police about “some threats that I need to document,” but she elaborated on the controversy in an email and texts to The Post.“In these volatile times, including one religious and cultural group and not the other sides would have been misconstrued all over (I unfortunately made the mistake of engaging in a conversation with Rabbi Mendy about it without getting the full opinion and guidance of the board),” Vermillion said in an email. “I don’t read or watch the news at all...too busy with festival organizing and life — wasn’t not FULLY aware of the atrocities happening until after the discussion had begun (and didn’t think thru how it could be twisted on us and then ironically this) and we quickly corrected to stay the course of UNIFYING, Cultural and religious NEUTRAL Live music, dance and street performers as we have for 14 yrs.”Heber said that Chabad has sold challah at the festival since May.“Our relationship with the Second Sunday festival has been wonderful, until now,” he said Monday in an interview with The Post. “We would have been perfectly fine with the response: ‘Rabbi, scheduling it’s not going to work,’ regardless of your reasoning. But to give me a reason that I need to take a political stance in order to move forward and confirm the details of the event is shocking and disturbing.”The United Jewish Community of the Virginia Peninsula issued a statement on Sunday calling the decision discriminatory and requesting that the organization reconsider holding a menorah lighting. Victoria LaCivita, a spokesperson for the Virginia Attorney General’s Office, said in an email that the agency’s antisemitism task force has been involved with local Jewish leaders regarding the incident.“Hanukkah is not political; it’s a peaceful religious holiday that has been celebrated and recognized for thousands of years,” Attorney General Jason Miyares said in a statement.Williamsburg Police Investigator Steve Roberts Jr. said he was not authorized to speak on the matter and referred questions to Nicole Trifone, a spokesperson for the city manager’s office. Trifone acknowledged in a statement Monday that the city knew of “messages that could be construed as threatening sent to the event and event organizer,” but added that they were not aware of any organized antisemitic activity.“This is a private matter in which the City of Williamsburg is not involved, and we have no role in curating the artists, vendors, or participants of 2nd Sundays,” Trifone said.Facebook users also have been commenting on the page of LoveLight Placemaking, the nonprofit organization behind the event. The commenters have criticized the group’s decision to refrain from holding a menorah lighting and the request that if such a ceremony did occur, it would need to be under a banner calling for a cease-fire. Commenters called the decision antisemitic.Vermillion rejects that characterization and said the street festival is being falsely accused of bigotry when organizers were not able to accommodate a menorah lighting for reasons relating to logistics as well as a desire to refrain from highlighting any specific religion. She said the organization supports the Jewish small businesses and musicians who participate in the festival.",6338,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/04/williamsburg-virginia-menorah-hanukkah-israel-gaza-war-festival/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,share sunday artist logistics formerly private authorize perfectly food strip opinion detail occur subsequent organization political jason vermillion proceed confirm mendy atrocity make musician december allege continue nonprofit ultimately woman hygienist regard founder american shock participant live organizer chance refer hanukkah role dispute mistake agency friend respond vendor watch volatile thousand washington message proposal official occurs cultural discussion banner user united accommodate general board neighbor specific speak difficult quickly support glenn cancel accuse youngkin stay participate document response accusation chabad read heber fully member damage reply weigh national knew twitter force relationship miyares group police leader controversy williamsburg trifone anticipate work antisemitism artisan fire ground matter deny peninsula full refrain islamic hold emphasize move potential holiday told guidance robert news elaborate statement placemaking ceremony rabbi reject twist celebration peace aware phone falsely menorah lovelight gaza start community relate dance monday happen gov spokesperson nicole reason civilian discriminatory desire fine amid sell festival call characterization night peaceful schedule virginia steve office religion give time action zionism x business darkness option light interview threaten side cease reflect art commenters email street comment hamas rejection post unify upcoming ironically stance page fourth performer fallout unfortunately celebrate love issue investigator arab choose local navigate single decision small add involve construe wonderful conversation busy manager month shirley question correct initially mile rise facebook event request immediately antisemitic neutral federal flee city challah absurd past prompt criticize available march highlight away religious hop victoria year begin misconstrue outlet acknowledge christian music family gazette attorney order reconsider organize include jewish life text bigotry dental lead r patient forward course task propose israel operation muslim medium threat expand engage displace recognize lacivita curating,0.94715,0.2366677185231934,11.28223972003499,0.3773972602739726,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Nicolas Cage wants to say ‘adios’ to movies and try out TV,2023-12-04 19:02:00,Alli Rosenbloom,"Nicolas Cage is a movie star with more than 100 film credits to his name, but the Oscar-winning actor may be ready to try something new.“I feel I’ve pretty much said what I’ve had to say with cinema,” Cage said in an interview with Uproxx published Monday. “I would say, ‘Adios.’ I did what I had to do with cinema and I want to move on now,” he later added.Currently starring in “Dream Scenario,” Cage has four more film projects he’s slated to appear in. Then, he said, he’s hopeful for a post-film career that will allow him to “switch formats and go into some other way of expressing my acting.”“I am very interested in immersion streaming with episodic television. I have seen things that can be done now with characters and the time they’re given to express themselves,” he said.Cage’s credits have allowed him to explore “the margins of film performance” in every genre, he said, but feels he may not have “anything else to learn in cinema.”Describing himself as a student, Cage is seeking more.“I might have something to learn in television,” he said.While a format switch is appealing to Cage, the 59-year-old also wishes to spend more quality time with his family, including his new baby daughter that he shares with wife Riko Shibata.“What’s important is my children,” Cage said. “I can find an episodic show to do that stays in one place where I don’t have to keep leaving, we can all be together.

Washington Post,First trailer for ‘Grand Theft Auto 6’ releases after leak,2023-12-04 18:52:00,Gene Park,"A decade of anticipation culminated Monday evening with the announcement of “Grand Theft Auto 6,” the sequel to a video game once called the most lucrative single entertainment media product ever.Series developer Rockstar Games released a highly anticipated first trailer for the game after it leaked on social media sites. The trailer was originally scheduled to show the morning of Dec. 5.In a minute-and-a-half trailer, developer Rockstar Games gave a glimpse into life in Vice City, the fictionalized version of Miami in a series that has lampooned the peculiarities of modern American civilization. A couple named Jason and Lucia share top billing as the protagonists of what appears to be a “started from the bottom” tale. The trailer showcases various details of Vice City life, from clubbing to crowded beaches, backed to Tom Petty’s 1989 track “Love is a Long Road.” The game is scheduled to release sometime in 2025.It’s been 10 years since “Grand Theft Auto 5” set sales records, as it earned $815.7 million in a single day, the highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours, according to Guinness World Records. In three days, it became the fastest video game to gross $1 billion.The trailer also shows how life has evolved in the last 10 years. In “GTA 5,” the game aimed its satire at Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. In 2023, “GTA 6” appears to acknowledge how live-streaming, Instagram Live, TikTok and public freakout videos flood the internet and pop culture. It seems to lean heavy into the “Florida Man” stereotype, the idea that residents of that state are prone to irrational and criminal public behavior. Southern hip-hop fashion and lifestyles also feature in prominence.“GTA 6” has been the subject of much attention in recent years, with preview images and videos of unfinished gameplay leaking to the public. Rumors have circulated for years that the game would revolve around two criminal protagonists, male and female, set in Vice City. A prankster in Germany became known for crashing live events and TV programs, including Europe’s biggest gaming convention Gamescom in August, demanding to see “Grand Theft Auto 6.”",2164,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,southern share august gross crash call couple male revolve detail social florida version pop schedule gta tiktok criminal glimpse jason modern freakout germany give culture beach protagonist public stereotype fashion announcement gamescom trailer tv civilization heavy rockstar originally generate behavior decade female irrational image american lucrative live feature unfinished lucia top demand vice back flood morning hour site love mark record billing developer prone culminate single preview revenue million big evolve rumor lampoon anticipation auto entertainment club facebook set prankster internet event theft zuckerberg miami long lean petty europe city accord lifestyle satire series fast video resident track year peculiarity day subject high sequel gameplay acknowledge attention release highly anticipate tom bottom earn circulate include product program state life idea world guinness show aim crowd showcase medium grand leak start game convention fictionalize instagram monday recent,-0.76545,0.0,9.468557457212713,0.3746115288220551,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Timothée Chalamet’s ‘Wonka’ is only semi-sweet,2023-12-04 17:19:00,Brian Lowry,"More a product of practical commerce than pure imagination, “Wonka” turns out to be a quirky, intermittently tasty confection, featuring Timothée Chalamet as the young inventor/magician/chocolatier in a super-caloric origin story. The star gives it his all, including plenty of not-bad/not-great singing, in a film that’s at its best when leveraging the abundant goodwill of the 1971 classic.Indeed, “Wonka” opens with quiet musical strains of “Pure Imagination,” and those catchy tunes from the Gene Wilder version eclipse the not-very-memorable new songs composed by Neil Hannon, which tend to rely on slightly groan-inducing lyrics, like Wonka singing to a young girl named Noodle (Calah Lane) that “some people don’t, and some people doodle.”Hewing toward Wilder (and wisely not Tim Burton’s darker 2005 take with Johnny Depp), Chalamet’s Willy Wonka steps off a boat from parts unknown with little more than a song in his heart, near-mystical chocolate-making skills and, as he sings, “a hatful of dreams.”Despite phones and old cars, the city where he disembarks has a Dickensian feel to it, including a boarding house run by an accomplished grifter played by Olivia Colman, one of the many members of English acting royalty who pop in, along with Jim Carter (“Downton Abbey”), Rowan Atkinson and Sally Hawkins, much like the Harry Potter series.As for villains, they consist of a trio of businessmen who head the chocolate cartel and see the fresh-faced Wonka and his divine gravity-defying treats as a threat to their enterprise. The de facto leader is named, appropriately, Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), and their corruption includes assistance from the local police chief (Keegan-Michael Key).Director Paul King oversaw the “Paddington” movies, which helps explain the rather inspired choice to feature Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa, who holds a grudge against Wonka for an unintended slight. While much has been made of Grant’s casting, the now-diminutive character doesn’t arrive until halfway through the movie and “the little orange man,” as he’s described, gives the whole enterprise a big shot of adrenalin every time he shows up.If Wilder’s Wonka was mischievously weird and a trifle mysterious, Chalamet’s take is more relentlessly upbeat, even in the face of crushing adversity, at one point channeling Blanche DuBois by saying that he has “relied on the kindness of strangers.”Still, “Wonka” only sporadically conjures cinematic magic, and most of those moments owe an oversized debt to tying directly into the earlier movie based on Roald Dahl’s story, as opposed to carving its own path for a new generation.First with “Dune” and now this, Chalamet has certainly become a key player in Warner Bros.’s efforts to breathe new life into venerable franchises, and this role arguably suits him better than the former.Although mostly appropriate for a younger audience, the irony is “Wonka” will probably play best among those who feel the strongest connections to a movie that premiered more than 50 years ago. Chalk that up to a movie that delivers some playfully clever elements but that, in terms of standing on its own, never entirely finds its sweet spot.“Wonka” premieres December 15 in US theaters and December 6 in a several international territories. It’s being released by Warner Bros., like CNN, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery, and rated PG.",3370,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/entertainment/wonka-review-timothee-chalamet-prequel/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230727052021-01-hugh-grant-oompa-loompa.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lyric discovery owe entirely cnn joseph playfully conjures arrive unintended despite probably rely make theater song turn slightly oppose audience tend earlier december warner olivia origin appropriately breathe heart dickensian goodwill tie feature role quiet chocolate hatful chalamet depp clever timothée sings potter downton base treat point weird run slugworth sally colman debt adrenalin effort corruption leverage dune paddington described play member hawkins mischievously catchy played rat trio leader police musical connection halfway gene part territory release wilder premiere noodle hold element girl dahl paterson key neil calah path mysterious burton premier wisely act oversized show kindness shot movie accomplish hannon phone magic plenty inspire king dubois carve darker enterprise version story pop give tim consist time character wonka explain assistance imagination businessmen grifter directly international rowan find head villain film strong divine confection adversity car lane orange johnny step appropriate boarding paul pg local ago crush compose relentlessly slight choice open big player suit sweet intermittently strain arguably skill irony boat channel atkinson franchise abundant hew tasty city venerable facto chief house grudge year stand unknown blanche bros star english sporadically pure eclipse practical willy upbeat oversaw disembarks carter moment royalty harry grant cinematic chalk cartel include hugh product feel commerce trifle life cast roald delivers young term sing unit threat quirky,0.967,0.5341246290801187,9.63246913580247,0.4847284533648168,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Sheryl Sandberg on Hamas attack: Rape should never be used as an act of war,2023-12-04 16:49:00,Catherine Thorbecke,"Sheryl Sandberg, a longtime advocate for women and girls’ rights, spoke out against Hamas’ use of sexual violence as a war tactic, saying at the United Nations Monday: “Rape should never be used as an act of war.”“Silence is complicity,” Sandberg said. “And in the face of terror, we cannot be quiet. That is why we are all here today to speak about unspeakable acts.”Sandberg, the former chief operating officer of Facebook (now Meta) and founder of the nonprofit group Lean In, spoke at an assembly hosted by Israel at the United Nation’s headquarters in New York on Monday“For over a decade, I’ve been urging women to lean in,” Sandberg said. “Now I call on everyone to speak out. And if the world isn’t listening to us, we’re just gonna have to speak louder.”“Anyone who has a mother, a sister, a daughter a wife, or a friend should join us to unite against rape,” she added. “This goes beyond politics. If we can’t agree that rape is wrong, then we have accepted the unacceptable. Then the question will be not what is happening in the Middle East but what is happening to our humanity?”Sandberg introduced Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, who took the stage to blast the silence from women’s advocacy groups on the issue. “When I saw the list of women’s rights organizations who have said nothing, I nearly choked,” Gillibrand said. “Where is the solidarity for women in this country and in this world to stand up for our mothers, our sisters and our daughters?”Senator Gillibrand called on the UN to denounce Hamas as a terrorist organization. The rest of her statement was made inaudible over the cheers and standing ovation from the room.Gillibrand slammed the “horrific acts” committed by Hamas on October 7 as “truly indescribable.” Several speakers reiterated that some human rights groups such as UN Women were too slow to condemn the rape and sexual violence.“We unequivocally condemn the brutal attacks by Hamas on Israel on 7 October,” the group said in a statement on Dec. 1. “We are alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks. This is why we have called for all accounts of gender-based violence to be duly investigated and prosecuted, with the rights of the victim at the core.”In the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attacks, Israeli police are interrogating suspects and compiling evidence, including video, forensics and witness testimony, to investigate accusations of rape during the attacks. Witnesses to the aftermath of the attacks say women and girls were sexually assaulted, tortured and killed.Hamas on Monday doubled down on its denial that its militants committed rape during the Oct. 7 attacks in a statement on Telegram. “We strongly reject and denounce the coordination of some Western media outlets with the Zionist misleading campaigns that promote unfounded lies and allegations aimed at demonizing the Palestinian resistance, the latest of which is the allegation that resistance members committed ‘sexual violence’ during the Battle of Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7th,” Hamas’ political office said in a statement on Telegram.Organizers of Monday’s meeting refuted that by showing mounting evidence that rape occurred during the attacks on Oct. 7, including graphic video footage of bodies, videos of Hamas fighters admitting under interrogation that rape occurred and testimony from Israeli police officers and witnesses to the attack and its aftermath. Speakers who prepared bodies for burial described evidence that militants gang raped some victims, purposely shot or mutilated victims in genital regions and murdered victims with cruelty such as multiple gunshots wounds.“A survivor from the Nova rave party testified, ‘Everything was an apocalypse of corpses, girls without any clothes on, without tops, without underwear, people cut in half, butchered, some where beheaded,” said Yael Reichert, a chief superintendent with the Israeli national police who is helping lead the investigation into sexual offenses committed on Oct. 7.Moreover, there seemed to be “a systematic genital mutilation of a group of victims,” said Shari G. Mendes, who worked in an Israeli military reserve unit to prepare deceased female soldiers for burial after the attacks. She said she witnessed the body of one young woman arrived “with no legs, they had been cut off.”Mendes said she “saw several severed heads. One with a large kitchen knife still embedded in the neck.”Simchat Greyman, a volunteer for ZAKA Search and Rescue, which recovered bodies from Southern Israel near Gaza after October 7th, testified to seeing a murdered woman with “nails and different objects in her female organs.” He also recalled a body they found that was so brutalized they “couldn’t even identify if it was a man or women.”Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also shared a video message at the event, calling on the global community to respond to “weaponized sexual violence where ever it happens with absolute condemnation.”“There can be no justifications and no excuses,” Clinton said. “Rape as a weapon of war is a crime against humanity.”“Organizations, governments and individuals who are committed to a better future for women and girls have a responsibility to condemn all violence against women,” Clinton implored. “It is outrageous that some who claim to stand for justice are closing their eyes and in their hearts to the victims of Hamas.”State Department spokesman Matt Miller said Monday that one of the reasons Hamas does not want to release women being held hostage seems to be because “they don’t want those women to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in custody.”Miller added later, however, that he could not “speak with a definitive assessment” that Hamas was keeping women as hostages to avoid their speaking publicly about what they’ve endured. He said that Hamas had agreed to release women and children hostages, but then “refused to release them” and “came up with excuses why” that Miller said he did not believe were credible.In an op-ed published by CNN last month, Sandberg called on the global community to put aside political differences and speak out.“We have come so far in believing survivors of rape and assault in so many situations, yet this time, many are ignoring the stories that these bodies tell us about how these women spent the last moments of their lives,” Sandberg wrote.“The silence on these war crimes is deafening,” Sandberg added. “It’s time to see beyond historical arguments about the past and political arguments about the future to denounce this now.”In an interview with the Times of London published on Sunday, Police Commander Shelly Harush, who is leading Israel’s investigation into sexual violence and crimes, said, “It’s clear now that sexual crimes were part of the planning and the purpose was to terrify and humiliate people.”Harush added that they have collected thousands of statements, photographs and video clips, including evidence of “girls whose pelvises were broken they had been raped so much.”",7077,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/tech/sheryl-sandberg-un-israel-hamas/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230111170931-catherine-thorbecke.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,denial today believe share sunday senator closing historical clothes shari rave complicity planning country daughter cnn occur survivor terrify assessment large organization political rape cut mutilation violence arrive refuse make atrocity mutilate advocate alarmed sandberg talk nonprofit woman western founder unequivocally heart secretary longtime decade accepted region pelvis commit global account london quiet flood decease friend respond individual military sheryl thousand telegram spokesman difference message multiple palestinian definitive mother united solidarity sexually unfounded investigation speak wake offense implore sister wife lean accusation excuse described terror coordination member purposely eye assembly national agree operating party cruelty greyman group gillibrand police rest lie burial prosecute part inaudible collect release situation work purpose nail join brutal interrogate commander found crime footage girl gang clinton leg state numerous slow justice world rap testify act fighter mendes systematic show sever battle shot statement avoid speaker reject prepare host choked admit meeting gaza community middle testimony monday list happen put blast behead half assault unacceptable southern reason yael october clip reserve weapon spoke clear call east photograph sexual story former mount office terrorist zaka time different late future object interview officer tactic zionist knife ignore nation head female denounce hamas volunteer recall department stage slam top absolute spent humiliate corps justification deafen issue victim suspect double recover harush matt shelly condemn hostage endure unite add promote held aftermath wrong israeli outrageous argument reiterate month allegation brutalize question facebook event urge genital resistance introduce york human reichert listen superintendent past chief cheer search claim ovation headquarters mislead video stand campaign silence humanity outlet weaponize publicly publish child gunshot gon attack refute broken embed politics moment murder soldier strongly identify meta kitchen unspeakable simchat body include advocacy graphic government life miller duly underwear lead witness demonize hillary democrat prepared young militant aim forensics israel evidence interrogation medium investigate nova butcher compile torture unit responsibility apocalypse rescue horrific kirsten,-0.9983,0.2119542178889359,9.317270726338958,0.3932053216144125,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Jonathan Majors’s assault trial begins as jurors hear opening statements,2023-12-04 16:35:00,Herb Scribner,"NEW YORK — Opening statements began Monday in the trial of Jonathan Majors, who is accused of assaulting an ex-girlfriend in an incident that derailed the actor’s budding career.During opening remarks, prosecutors alleged Majors put his ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari through years of abuse that ended with the alleged assault. The defense described Jabbari as a woman afraid of losing her relationship and willing to unfairly frame Majors for violent acts in revenge.Majors is facing charges of misdemeanor assault and harassment, which stem from a dispute he had with Jabbari in March. According to prosecutors, Majors and Jabbari had an argument when they were riding home in a chauffeured car. During the dispute, Jabbari attempted to snatch Majors’s phone after he received a flirty text. Prosecutors say Majors fractured Jabbari’s finger while taking it off his phone and twisting her arm. Majors allegedly struck Jabbari’s ear and threw her back into the car when she attempted to follow him out of it.Majors pleaded not guilty, and his attorneys say that he was the victim in the incident. The trial, which was postponed on a number of occasions, began on Nov. 29 with jury selection. He faces one year in prison if convicted.Jabbari was arrested and released in October by the New York police based on charges of misdemeanor assault and criminal mischief, which stem from the fight with Majors. The Manhattan district attorney’s office declined to pursue the charges because they didn’t hold “prosecutorial merit.”Donning a long black peacoat, large sunglasses and a black beret, Majors walked into the courtroom on Monday flanked by his mother and his girlfriend, actress Meagan Good. Throughout opening statements, Majors, sitting between his attorneys, looked down, avoiding eye contact, his head slightly cocked to one side, listening to the remarks and occasionally jotting down notes in a notepad.The district attorney’s office described Jabbari as the victim of ongoing domestic violence over the course of a tumultuous two-year relationship, including emotional, verbal and physical abuse.“Domestic violence, a pattern of behavior that betrays an intimate partner’s trust and has historically taken place in shadows, it can take many forms: a deep stare, a derogatory comment, throwing things at a wall, withholding affection, and physical abuse,” Assistant District Attorney Michael Perez told jurors.Perez said Jabbari suffered under the abuse of Majors for asking to see the text message on his phone. She said Jabbari’s actions on the night of the alleged incident resembled those of a domestic abuse victim.Perez described Majors as a demanding boyfriend, expecting Jabbari to take a subservient role in his fame, saying Majors told her that she needed “to live up to the standard of Loretta Scott King and Michelle Obama, Barack Obama’s wife, and she needed to make sacrifices for him because defendant said ‘I am a great man, a great man,’” citing previous correspondence between the couple.Priya Chaudhry, Majors’ defense attorney, in opening arguments said Jabari was unstable and an aggressor who was looking to exact revenge on the actor’s career. In the moments after the altercation, Major texted Jabbari, according to Chaudhry, breaking off the relationship and in turn causing Jabbari to frame Majors as an abuser.“Majors and Jabbari were in a relationship with ups and downs, arguments about her drinking, his traveling, her jealousy,” Chaudhry said.Witness testimonies were expected to follow the opening statements on Monday.",3557,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2023/12/04/jonathan-majors-assault-trial-opening-statements/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZYXZ26YHUMTPDIZHRQYCHMBXQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZYXZ26YHUMTPDIZHRQYCHMBXQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZYXZ26YHUMTPDIZHRQYCHMBXQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZYXZ26YHUMTPDIZHRQYCHMBXQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZYXZ26YHUMTPDIZHRQYCHMBXQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZYXZ26YHUMTPDIZHRQYCHMBXQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,harassment incident verbal loretta october stem girlfriend jealousy rid aggressor night subservient betrays large criminal derail boyfriend office unfairly ongoing trust exact career violence historically action make actor contact expect turn slightly decline violent allege woman side altercation occasionally previous district chaudhry home head behavior revenge comment courtroom cocked number live derogatory pursue role demand break jonathan dispute threw back michelle charge car black receive intimate scott victim meagan message snatch domestic opening abuse wall finger mother defendant texted standard grace ear trial base throw jotting peacoat guilty selection argument sacrifice shadow ups tumultuous walk prosecutor accuse jabari arrest remark wife jury long york described assistant accord listen eye place major flirty march relationship prison police perez year begin mischief misdemeanor withholding fracture physical michael resemble arm release emotional drinking actress manhattan allegedly form attorney moment budding occasion hold prosecutorial obama include partner affection text struck defense follow fight told chauffeur act plead deep note correspondence attempt sunglass postpone course stare great unstable frame statement beret jabbari avoid pattern suffer twist flank phone travel king testimony barack monday lose put assault afraid fame,-0.9955,0.084340736575766,10.933477588871714,0.3727012651431255,0,2023-12-04
NPR,Disinformation researcher says Harvard pushed her out to protect Meta,2023-12-04 16:24:00,Shannon Bond,"In a legal filing sent to the U.S. Department of Education and the Massachusetts attorney general's office, Joan Donovan accused the university of violating her free speech rights and the school's own commitment to academic freedom ""in order to protect the interests of high-value donors with obvious and direct ties to Meta/Facebook."" Donovan alleged the pressure campaign came as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable organization established by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, that was pledging $500 million to fund a new university-wide center on artificial intelligence at Harvard. ""There are a handful of tried-and-true means to coerce someone or some entity to do something they would not otherwise do, and influence through financial compensation is at or near the top of the list,"" Donovan's attorneys wrote in the filing. ""Objectively, $500 million is certainly significant financial influence."" Donovan had worked at the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center since 2018, serving as research director and leading its Technology and Social Change Research Project, which studied media manipulation campaigns. She was a prominent expert on social media and online disinformation, testifying before Congress, raising millions of dollars in grant funding, and being frequently cited by news media, including NPR. Donovan alleged a project she was involved in to publish thousands of internal Facebook documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen was the trigger that led Harvard to shut down her work last year and ultimately eliminate her role. In August, Donovan was hired as an assistant professor at Boston University. The filing asks for a formal investigation by federal education officials into whether Harvard was ""inappropriately influenced by Meta"" and whether it was misleading donors and misappropriating money given to fund Donovan's work, among other things. Donovan is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit organization that also represented Haugen in her complaint against Facebook. Harvard disputed Donovan's claims. Her ""allegations of unfair treatment and donor interference are false,"" Kennedy School spokesperson James Smith said in a statement. ""The narrative is full of inaccuracies and baseless insinuations, particularly the suggestion that Harvard Kennedy School allowed Facebook to dictate its approach to research."" A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative said in a statement: ""CZI had no involvement in Dr. Donovan's departure from Harvard and was unaware of that development before public reporting on it."" Latanya Sweeney, a Harvard professor who worked with Donovan on the Facebook documents project, known as FBarchive, also denied Donovan's accusations in a response shared with NPR by Smith. ""The number and nature of inaccuracies and falsehoods in the document are so abundant and self-serving as to be horribly disappointing,"" Sweeney said. ""Meta exerted no influence over FBarchive or any of our/my work. Just a few weeks ahead of the public launch, we offered Meta the chance to review the archive for security and privacy concerns and suggest redactions, which we independently elected to accept or reject."" Smith said Harvard Kennedy School's ""longstanding policy"" requires all research projects to be led by faculty members, and Donovan was staff, not faculty. ""When the original faculty leader of the project left Harvard, the School tried for some time to identify another faculty member who had time and interest to lead the project. After that effort did not succeed, the project was given more than a year to wind down. Joan Donovan was not fired, and most members of the research team chose to remain at the School in new roles,"" Smith said. He added that Harvard continues to research misinformation and social media. Meta declined to comment.",3872,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1217086770/disinformation-researcher-says-harvard-pushed-her-out-to-protect-meta,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/12/04/gettyimages-1232559764-61cba2d948daf3a6fa04c21688456138c230b519-s1100-c50.jpg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,share longstanding falsehood august interest haugen social week czi team organization unfair frequently coerce commitment decline chan shorenstein allege nonprofit continue ultimately founder remain tie chance number misinformation role dispute archive technology free thousand offer involvement sweeney security official violate artificial fbarchive suggestion succeed priscilla approach aid million general investigation complaint represent protect financial freedom accuse wife shut effort document online accusation response france assistant member misappropriate wind require manipulation objectively significant formal school initiative independently hire leader faculty left insinuation work fire policy deny intelligence full departure accept filing internal pressure testify baseless news npr direct dictate inappropriately education write statement reject leak disinformation inaccuracy list launch academic treatment spokesperson chose fund asks narrative donovan office james study give time boston public influence privacy concern kennedy trigger particularly center comment ahead department top legal mark change money latanya horribly add involve massachusetts charitable serve false exert allegation staff facebook zuckerberg federal eliminate smith establish research abundant funding prominent harvard claim mislead handful nature year original dollar campaign expert publish obvious suggest congress raise director entity university attorney order unaware grant identify meta include development lead whistleblower project donor compensation redaction medium pledge interference speech professor review reporting elect joan disappoint,0.79315,0.0,11.765714285714282,0.3926083754208753,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,"At Fortas and Washington Concert Opera, fine pairs and doomed couples",2023-12-04 16:05:00,Michael Andor Brodeur,"At the Kennedy Center on Friday night, violinist Jennifer Koh gave her first performance on the Terrace Theater stage as artistic director of the Fortas Chamber Music Series, which this season has hosted violinists Augustin Hadelich and Maxim Vengerov, a farewell from the Emerson String Quartet and a recital from bass-baritone Bryn Terfel. Still, if you’re a Fortas faithful, Friday’s program may have triggered déjà vu.Joined by former mentor Jaime Laredo, Koh and about two dozen players from the Juilliard Orchestra revisited a program titled “Two x Four” — a celebration of four classical and contemporary concertos for two violins, first presented by Fortas in 2013 with an orchestra of musicians from the Curtis Institute.Repeating a program from 10 years ago nearly verbatim may seem like a strange way to signal a fresh start, but with her stewardship of Fortas, Koh aimed to pay tribute to pianist Joseph “Yossi” Kalichstein, the longtime Fortas artistic director who died in 2022 — and whose trio with Laredo and cellist Sharon Robinson The Washington Post once dubbed “the greatest piano trio on the face of the Earth.”Apart from a swapped-out closer (instead of Tchaikovsky’s Serenade for Strings in C, we finished with Mozart’s delightful Sinfonia Concertante in E-flat), Friday’s menu was precisely the same. Yet this reprise felt more like a refresh — a welcome reminder of the unique pleasures of the double concerto.In Bach’s Concerto for Two Violins, Strings and Continuo in D minor (BWV 1043), Koh and Laredo seemed to tell a story about their former dynamic as student/teacher at Curtis: Koh’s lines were bright, lively and piquant; Laredo’s rustic and leathery. Trading lines and smiles, they played the hell out of it. At one point, Koh even kicked off her heels.Violinists Gabrielle Després and Coco Mi were led by conductor Sasha Scolnik-Brower in “Seasons Lost,” an entrancing (and slightly despondent) homage to Vivaldi by Juilliard dean and birthday boy David Serkin Ludwig. The two violinists beautifully etched a winter of stark stillness; a gusty, indecisive spring; a summer of slumping glissandos and whirring bugs; and a pouncing autumn, crisp and scrubby.Violinist Hina Khuong-Huu joined Koh for Anna Clyne’s evocative “Prince of Clouds,” which sends streaky contrails of violin skyward over lowing bass and stretches of percussive pizzicato before coming in for an impossibly soft landing. Matthew Hakkarainen and Maya Kilburn offered a strikingly human reading of Philip Glass’s “Echorus,” weaving its mechanistic repetitions into a cozy blanket.Koh and Laredo reunited onstage for Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante in E-flat, which showcased each musician’s singular voice: Laredo, in particular, loves to finish his grainy lines with folksy serifs. The whole evening felt less like a study of a form than a celebration of a friendship. I’ll look forward to “Two x Four: Part Three.”The following evening at Lisner Auditorium, Washington Concert Opera opened its 37th season with the area debut of “Ermione,” a nearly forgotten Grecian romp that purports to be a tragedy, despite a clear outbreak of satisfied smiles at its conclusion.In his program notes, WCO co-founder Peter Russell pointed out that the 1819 premiere of “Ermione” was received by audiences at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples as a “bewildering hot mess” — and those folks were not wrong. Based on Jean Racine’s 1667 play “Andromaque,” this convoluted post-Trojan War tragedy is constructed upon an actively collapsing quadrangle of unrequited love, with the confusion and occasional fury of its characters racing through Rossini’s instantly recognizable and conspicuously rollicking score.But the unruly tangle of the plot paired with the undeniable tastiness of Rossini’s music make “Ermione” an ideal candidate for a concert opera presentation. Spared the added dimension of a staging, and supported with Antony Walker’s sure-footed conducting, Rossini’s rich and restless score really popped, which is no mean feat at the Lisner, a venue that eats sound. The woodwinds were especially fine and brimming with character.Soprano Angela Meade is herself a seasoned Ermione, who has sung the role in Lyon, Moscow, Paris and the very house in Naples where the opera premiered. On Saturday, there was only a trace in Meade’s voice of the respiratory infection she was reportedly fighting off — and her subdued powers may have worked to her advantage in the hall. Torn between fragile grace and murderous rage — sometimes in the same aria — the role of Ermione requires enough control to seem properly out of control, and enough humor to lend her crackpot tendencies some tenderness. Meade met the challenge fearlessly, if not flawlessly.Mezzo-soprano Ginger Costa-Jackson was sensational as the newly widowed Andromaca, her show-opening aria (“Mia delizia”) an early showstopper delivered with striking clarity. She brought an electric presence to her podium whenever she stepped onstage. (I heard more than one audience member comment on the piercing eye contact she dealt across the auditorium.)The show’s two tenors made fine foils: David Portillo delivered an exceptionally peevish Pirro, his powerful voice nimble and gleaming, especially his Act I aria (“Balena il man del figlio”) and his Act II duet with the reluctant Andromaca (“Ombra del caro sposo!”). Lawrence Brownlee was a captivating Oreste, his voice a skillfully flicked blade that cut through the rest of cast, reinforcing Oreste’s outsider status. The pacing of his duet with Pilade (“Reggia abborrita!”) struck me as a touch a too tick-tocky, but Brownlee’s decoration softened its sharper edges.Bass-baritone Matthew Scollin as Fenicio and tenor Matthew Hill made magnificent work of Fenicio and Pilade’s Act II duet, and soprano Erin Ridge offered an endearing, sympathetic Cleone that made me wish she had more to say/sing. And in ensemble, the entire cast sounded smartly balanced and cohesive — even as their respective relationships downgraded into ecstatic mass confusion.Each singer brought just enough characterization to spark a scintilla of semi-staged drama, but it was Rossini’s music that brought the biggest surprises and carried the night.",6228,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2023/12/04/review-fortas-washington-concert-opera-ermione/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,glass felt mess artistic present glissando pair aria quadrangle construct tragedy advantage crackpot joseph reunite endear lyon cellist maya piquant violin sound ecstatic title powerful terfel sends cut ermione theater despite trace make entire sposo contact smile concerto musician jennifer slightly audience fearlessly winter curtis control pace pirro deliver touch naples ideal cleone longtime hall racine performance tangle unrequited carlo gusty concertante recognizable emerson humor antony signal torn déjà meade role menu nimble wco feat murderous hadelich receive onstage fury lisner newly washington rich offer figlio sharon gabrielle singer especially autumn grace captivate verbatim conductor paris base point popped indecisive ridge stretch support drama reportedly continuo rustic quartet soprano spar birthday weave strikingly reinforce scintilla recital particular stark area streaky orchestra play score entrance member eye koh status pierce require string romp played opera serif relationship ludwig boy heard folk bryn andromaque trio tendency rest juilliard rossini impossibly abborrita land contrail decoration properly actively part delizia blade dean work folksy occasional balena tenderness cozy join eats premiere early form percussive violinist race plot angela surprise magnificent ombra subdue bwv farewell san etch convolute walker mechanistic showcased low woodwind follow dubbed premier classical act closer pay fortas fragile show candidate tchaikovsky debut strike reprise hell celebration grecian grainy host portillo bach hot start echorus forgotten mass carry chamber power pianist sensational pilade kalichstein kilburn coco reluctant sympathetic sasha stag brownlee dimension fine yossi clear unique dealt scollin unruly characterization night flick story widowed former spring study give repetition brimming beautifully character minor skyward x soft dozen bass showstopper spark soften mentor contemporary clarity andromaca finish sung cohesive kennedy trigger prince center voice ginger comment oreste post faithful teatro jean stage kick hill auditorium laredo maxim podium caro peevish stewardship sinfonia downgrade fenicio homage satisfied purport bug step despondent love concert friday bewildering vivaldi double tribute ago mozart bright vengerov tenor pounce conspicuously lend smartly strange refresh add tastiness summer leathery david robinson open big sharper player wrong trading respective singular lawrence hakkarainen infection conduct restless skillfully fresh serenade undeniable reading revisit brought human delightful jaime philip confusion challenge reggia line house ensemble series reminder wish year russell friendship precisely duet instantly moscow piano cloud foil augustin music director slump hina season rollick respiratory welcome outsider anna erin collapse program instead presentation presence struck cast crisp fight lead gleam pleasure clyne outbreak note venue balance forward serkin evocative great aim exceptionally dynamic pizzicato rage lively terrace stillness whir saturday electric lose matthew,0.9945,0.2890173410404624,10.414545454545454,0.5159389221889222,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Two Smithsonian shows spotlight the topical video art of John Akomfrah,2023-12-04 15:32:00,not specified,"John Akomfrah dreams of finding a passage north, undiscovered and unspoiled.The motif appears over and over in the artist’s sweeping video installations, two of which are on view on the National Mall: His camera lingers on an isolated individual, tracing the person’s gaze over a lonely wintry landscape. It’s a visual cue, the Rückenfigur (German for backward-facing figure), that Akomfrah has borrowed from artists of the romanticist movement time and time again.One specific reference is woven through many of the British Ghanaian filmmaker’s works: “Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog,” the essential painting by Caspar David Friedrich, from around 1817. It depicts a ginger-haired gentleman in a lush green overcoat, clutching a walking stick and peering out from a rocky promontory. Misty rolling hills trail off in the distance. This painting points to true north on the romantic’s compass: To explore the self means to seek the sublime.Akomfrah’s cinematic installations summon the same rich interior relationship with nature. It’s more than a vibe: Akomfrah is working to reconcile 19th-century romantic aesthetics with 21st-century collectivist problems. For a project indebted to history and theory, Akomfrah’s works are nothing less than mesmerizing.“Purple” is Akomfrah’s most immense video installation to date. Comprising six screens, the 2017 piece occupies an entire minor arc of the ring-shaped Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Throughout the film — or films, since watching “Purple” requires a viewer to take in all six screens simultaneously — Akomfrah pairs contemporary footage from voyages to remote locales with historical clips from factories, mines and other industrial settings. The message is as simple as it is urgent: The Anthropocene era is putting the natural sublime at risk.Curated by Marina Isgro, the roughly hour-long work is subdivided into five movements, which proceed like a symphony. Visual themes surface and repeat over the course of the piece: an overhead view of the bow of a ship, for example, as it makes a rapid clip across the water. (The actual soundtrack is a soothing ambient score by British composers Tandis Jenhudson and David Julyan.) Footage shot in Alaska and Greenland (among other sites) finds one solitary figure after another, dressed in a sturdy white jacket, surveying the immensity of these Arctic reaches.Akomfrah puts down a few explicit literary markers. One of many cryptic titles that flash across the screens reads, “O earth what changes hast thou seen!,” a line from a sprawling 1850 poem, “In Memoriam,” by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. But for the most part, the artist tells his story through atmosphere. Utility pylons stand as a metaphor for the reach of industry across the landscape. Nuclear cooling towers mirror the majesty of Arctic mountain ranges. Sled dogs evoke both the resilience of Indigenous communities and the larger-than-life explorers of the 19th century, while scenes of poisoned landscapes reveal the eventual corruption of the heroic narrative.For an indictment of climate change and colonialism, Akomfrah’s message is nuanced. Among the historical clips of industrial laborers dredging up resources or Alaska energy officials divvying up the territory are scenes of workers singing beautiful, indiscernible laments. This is a stolidly pro-labor film. Yet the medium — the sensational totality of Akomfrah’s crisp editing, gorgeous photography and enveloping presentation — cuts against the grain of critique. Even at its rawest moments, “Purple” is almost suspiciously beautiful.“Five Murmurations,” a 2021 work by Akomfrah on view at the National Museum of African Art, takes on another steep social provocation. Curated by Karen E. Milbourne, this hour-long, three-channel video represents the artist’s summary of a tumultuous 18-month period stretching from late 2019 to early 2021, encapsulating the twin traumas of the coronavirus pandemic and police brutality.Akomfrah begins, naturally, with a painting from Western art history, this time Hieronymus Bosch’s “The Conjurer” (circa 1502). A relatively mild work by Bosch — the smutty poet laureate of Pandemonium — the painting shows a magician who enthralls a crowd with a shell game while a cutpurse relieves an onlooker of his wallet. It’s something of a non sequitur for “Five Murmurations,” which also features Andrea Mantegna’s “The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ” (1480s), an utterly physical quattrocento painting that speaks pointedly to the police killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Mantegna sought to show the physical violence of the crucifixion by painting Christ’s body, dead on a slab, the stigmata of his feet confronting the viewer: a reminder that Jesus was a man killed by the state.While it would seem like old hat for the 8-billion-odd people who survived covid-19, Akomfrah returns to those early weeks of the pandemic and captures a vivid sensation of that unsettling time. It’s a simple sequence: Amid narrow shots of maps and charts, the visual artifacts of the pandemic as it unfolded, the artist inserts scenes of people cooking meals at home. It’s a faithful yet evocative gloss of those days of uncertainty and isolation, when it seemed like the only thing to do was to hit refresh on various counters that only grew more alarming as the danger drew nearer. Akomfrah finds an essential metaphor for that harrowing blur of data and despair in murmurations of birds, patterns of movement too chaotic to trace.With his absorbing cinematics, Akomfrah is something of a conjurer himself. Not a con artist, but a spellbinding storyteller who is able to suggest a political ideal without being (too) explicit. There is a danger to an immersive video installation such as “Purple,” which takes a format so arresting, so alluring, that it threatens to obscure any message an artist might hope to convey.

Washington Post,Top Tucker Carlson producer accused of sexually assaulting Fox staffer,2023-12-04 15:20:00,Will Sommer,"A former Fox News employee has sued the network and a top producer for former prime-time star Tucker Carlson, alleging that the senior staffer sexually assaulted and harassed him after promising to help advance his career.In the lawsuit filed in New York State Court, Andrew Delancey claims that Justin Wells repeatedly grabbed his genitals at Wells’s apartment shortly after Delancey was hired in 2008, and that superiors dissuaded him from filing complaints.A brief version of the suit — claiming assault and battery on the part of Wells, and negligence and sexual harassment on the part of Fox — was originally filed late last month, just ahead of a deadline for claims under the New York Adult Survivors Act, which temporarily lifted the statute of limitations for civil complaints from sexual assault victims. The full complaint was filed Monday.“Wells utilized his status at Fox to prey on Mr. Delancey,” the complaint reads.Wells, who was working for a show hosted by Greta Van Susteren at the time, later became the senior executive producer for Carlson’s show and was fired alongside him in April. Wells now works as a top producer on a video series Carlson now presents on the social media network X.Harmeet Dhillon, an attorney for Wells, called the suit “meritless” and said her client ""denies the allegations unequivocally and will contest them vigorously.”A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.The complaint alleges that Wells first contacted Delancey in 2007 through a Facebook group for Fox employees when Delancey was still working for a local Fox station in Florida, writing in the message that Delancey had “caught [his] eye” and encouraging him to take a job at the company’s New York City operations. Delancey eventually took a job at Fox News Edge, a Fox division that deals with local affiliates.Delancey alleges that Wells lavished an unusual amount of attention on him after he arrived, giving him personally monogrammed pencils and notebooks with Fox branding and promising to help him “learn the ropes” at the cable-news giant. When Delancey complained that he couldn’t afford to live in New York on an entry-level salary, he claims that Wells helped him secure an interview at another network.Less than a month after Delancey started at Fox, Wells invited him to meet other Fox colleagues at a gay bar, according to the lawsuit. Wells allegedly insisted that the pair first drink at Wells’s apartment, where Delancey claims Wells “easily overpowered” him, forcing him onto his bed and grabbing his genitals and causing what Delancey describes as “severe pain,” even as Delancey yelled out “no.”“Out of nowhere, Wells aggressively pushed Mr. Delancey onto his bed where he violently forced his tongue into Mr. Delancey’s mouth,” the complaint states.Delancey convinced Wells that they needed to go meet their co-workers, according to the lawsuit, but Wells again allegedly groped him in a stairwell against his consent.Later, Delancey claims that Wells turned on him. The interview Wells helped set up for Delancey at another company never resulted in a job, and according to Delancey’s claim, Wells “menacingly” told him that he “wasn’t thinking straight.”Delancey’s lawsuit also alleges that Fox deprived the staffer of a way to complain, claiming that his supervisor there made him swear not to complain about anything he experienced at Fox to human resources.Delancey first went public with many of his details about the assault in a 2017 Facebook post, according to the lawsuit, although he didn’t name Wells. Delancey alleges that Wells saw the Facebook post and messaged him to ask who had committed the assault, with what Delancey speculates was “a guilty conscience.”“Mr. Delancey will no longer be intimidated by Mr. Wells or Fox,” Delancey’s lawyer, Alfredo J. Pelicci, said in a statement to The Washington Post. “Our firm is committed to holding Justin Wells and Fox accountable for their unlawful and abhorrent actions.”Fox has filed a motion to move the case to federal court, noting that Delancey no longer lives in New York.",4098,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2023/12/04/fox-news-sexual-harassment-tucker-carlson-producer-justin-wells/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,harassment severe convince edge present pair swear firm company complain detail social survivor shortly client deal division battery learn pelicci arrive make contact turn amount overpower speculates allege stairwell alleges unequivocally originally harass commit live justin promising bed respond alfredo washington message mouth carlson intimidate susteren staffer sexually guilty complaint push menacingly set denies meritless executive afford eye status andrew branding superior force dissuade tongue giant employee hire group lift part deprive repeatedly work delancey fox fire unusual network allegedly full lawyer statute hold experienced filing state mr move told act yell news contest show lawsuit write statement genitals aggressively host supervisor start bar violently dhillon assault describes spokesperson result alongside call civil drink salary florida sexual version advance temporarily former tucker senior station longer time give public groped late interview colleague post ahead meet eventually lavish top grabbed april victim monogrammed accountable local apartment pain rope insist prey secure greta suit abhorrent encourage month allegation facebook request gay file federal york human city accord negligence claim case series pencil caught video court attention star utilized motion attorney easily personally life deadline producer note job unlawful grab operation medium adult invite notebook limitation,-0.98005,0.1464128843338213,10.19681462140992,0.4244854202401371,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Hoobastank has ‘The Reason’ to celebrate,2023-12-04 15:09:00,Lisa Respers France,"When Hoobastank vocalist Doug Robb thinks about “The Reason” turning 20, he feels old.“It all depends on what specific moment I think about,” Robb told CNN. “Sometimes it feels like it was a blink of an eye, but sometimes it feels like it’s another lifetime ago.”The band is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the album with a special show at The Echo in Los Angeles this month.Both the album (the band’s second) and the hit single of the same title remains beloved by fans two decades later.As a matter of fact, the single “The Reason” is so popular that the music video for the tune has more than 1 billion streams on YouTube and the song is poised to hit that same number on Spotify.Robb said he and his fellow band members never anticipated such popularity.“I don’t think anybody did, to be honest with you, because when we were done recording the songs that we thought were going to be on the album, obviously it was one of them,” he said. “But it was, in our eyes, the kind of the token mellower or softer song that we had put on a previous album and we had always done even in stuff prior to our record deal.”Now both an official oldie and earworm, Robb laughed at the many theories about the song’s inspiration.“I used to get asked all the time ‘Who’s it about?’ because everybody would think it’s about a specific person that I’m talking to,” he said. “But lyrically it was written by piecing together a bunch of old lyrics that I had not used and other stream-of-conscious-type writings. And so after 20 years of being asked that question and thinking about it, the song is really about me, I guess.”There’s been a recent resurgence in the song due in part to its inclusion as part of the soundtrack of Netflix limited series, “Beef.”It’s also popular on TikTok, which Robb said he’s on so he can know what his teenage children are into these days.And how do his kids feel about their old man being a rock star?“They don’t care at all,” he said, laughing. “They think I’m an idiot, which is partly true. They don’t see me that way. My daughter specifically, she’s 13, so she doesn’t want anything to do with it.”Cue Robb singing the opening line from “The Reason.”“I’m not a perfect person,” the lyrics goes.Fortunately, fans of Hoobastank feel the opposite about their music.",2287,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/entertainment/hoobastank-reason-20th-anniversary/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220413113637-03-lisa-france-headshots.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,oldie lyric reason softer hit beloved daughter cnn poise idiot rock popular tiktok piece title bunch cue time song turn angeles perfect talk netflix anniversary echo previous decade laugh number theory earworm limited celebrate stuff record robb token single official opening remains vocalist album specific specifically doug question honest inclusion band member eye series line prior video stream year due mellower youtube soundtrack child star part anticipate music depends partly matter moment lifetime writing resurgence special blink feel told teenage fellow show kind write billion sing fact hoobastank lyrically opposite person recent kid put,0.9812,0.1311762133799737,5.234474708171206,0.3782212885154062,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,‘Fallen Leaves’: The master of deadpan romance casts his spell again,2023-12-04 14:54:00,Ann Hornaday,"Ansa works in a Helsinki supermarket, collecting expired food and cadging the odd casserole for her dinner. Holappa is a laborer, working on scrap metal yards and construction sites. As they drift through their days, these two solitary, anonymous souls couldn’t be more banal. Or more captivating. In “Fallen Leaves,” the latest straight-faced serio-comedy from writer-director Aki Kaurismäki, Ansa and Holappa have all the makings of the kind of dispassionate, highly stylized, quietly operatic love stories only the Finnish master of deadpan romance can make.Fans of Kaurismäki will instantly recognize his house style: Ansa, portrayed in a sweetly laconic performance by Alma Pöysti, might seem to live a drab existence, commuting from market to her cramped apartment in a bored daze. But her home is alive with vibrant color, the reds and greens popping with the pulpy extravagance of Douglas Sirk. Holappa, played by Jussi Vatanen in a turn that channels Jimmy Stewart by way of Jim Jarmusch, ameliorates his ennui by steadily drinking, which is why he and Ansa fetch up at the same karaoke club one night and embark on a journey of crossed signals, blown chances and fateful near misses.With its deliberate pacing and the actors’ purposefully uninflected delivery, “Fallen Leaves” finds Kaurismäki at his most theatrically mannered; he has always had a gift for finding great faces, and he has discovered two quirkily charismatic doozies here. (The supporting cast is just as watchable, functioning as a gorgeously eccentric Greek chorus and background tableau.) With his painterly compositions, precise framing, velvety lighting and richly saturated color palette, Kaurismäki builds a world that’s simultaneously quotidian and suffused with enchantment (the story’s fairy-tale elements are heightened by a soundtrack dominated by achingly pretty pop songs and classical pieces).There are moments when “Fallen Leaves” threatens to fall prey to self-conscious absurdism for its own sake: When Holappa takes Ansa to see Jarmusch’s “The Dead Don’t Die” — after which two fellow audience members invoke Bresson and Godard — one senses Kaurismäki straining too hard for hipster cred. But as long as his impassive but compassionate camera is trained on Ansa and Holappa, “Fallen Leaves” casts an irresistible spell, one that’s as playful as it is full of longing and pathos. Even at his most muted and mordantly droll, Kaurismäki is a humanist at his core; he might test how much our hearts can take, but we can rest assured he won’t break them.",2545,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/12/04/fallen-leaves-movie-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dinner green sweetly food threatens uninflected simultaneously alive night composition story pop greek piece humanist pulpy vibrant kaurismäki mute drift actor song stylize dispassionate turn audience late light color pace dominate train build find heart compassionate home market style douglas cadge casserole performance saturate stewart mannered live chance embark blown signal break cramped purposefully sens alma supermarket laborer construction solitary metal site love master delivery theatrically apartment tableau quotidian camera invoke hard pretty irresistible jussi captivate deadpan watchable jarmusch prey bresson sake quirkily drab extravagance odd support bore enchantment precise club cred longing core assure strain making long charismatic existence channel mordantly member cross yard played gorgeously jimmy house doozies fateful chorus palette rest day soul instantly spell soundtrack vatanen hipster commute red deliberate collect drinking eccentric ennui highly droll work godard suffuse richly daze moment ameliorates full leaf expire element portrayed journey banal achingly world romance cast classical scrap background karaoke fellow kind operatic absurdism test finnish gift great impassive steadily painterly frame helsinki heighten playful velvety anonymous pöysti fetch sirk laconic dead ansa recognize fall pathos quietly holappa discover function,0.99065,0.0,10.097130801687763,0.55975,0,2023-12-04
Chicago Tribune,McGonigal’s in downtown Barrington ‘not generating nearly enough business’ to stay afloat and will close month-end,2023-12-04 14:15:00,not specified,"Along with the current year drawing to a close at the end of the month, the owners of a popular pub in Barrington announced Monday that the restaurant and popular town gathering spot will also shut its doors — for good.A message on Facebook states that, “...it comes with an extremely heavy heart to report that McGonigal’s Pub will be closing for business at the end of this month.” The social media post is signed by owner Bryan McGonigal.McGonigal’s Pub opened its doors in March 2010. It is scheduled to close Dec. 31, according to the social media post. Financial hardship “for quite some time” is cited as the reason for shutting down. McGonigal stated in the Facebook post that a “significant amount of family money” has been unsuccessfully poured into what he described as a financially overwhelmed business.He stated that “for quite some time the Pub hasn’t been generating nearly enough business to retain viability. Over the years we’ve worked hard and tried virtually everything we could to guide it in the right direction ... to keep it going.”McGonigal declined to further discuss the announcement of closing, with Pioneer Press referred back to the social media post.“I completely understand that this is a tough one to swallow for our loyal patrons, the McGonigal family and our extended family – our fantastic, dedicated, staff,” the social media post states. “There are a lot of memories to share, people to thank and some heartfelt reflection from our nearly fourteen years in the big old brick bank building at 105 S. Cook Street, right in the heart of downtown Barrington.”The restaurateur and bar owner stated in the post that more information is to come. In the meantime, though, he said the doors of McGonigal’s are open for business for a few more weeks.“We definitely plan on going out in a positive fashion!” he said.",1844,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/barrington/ct-bcr-mcgonigals-pub-closing-year-end-tl-1207-20231204-mttgnresijhatmirlyfghkoyby-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/LfOO2letgGRIoBknbuNbvvlfkaE=/377x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/KSZRK6TSE5BLZOSIJBMFZGUHQI.jpg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,extremely direction hardship town meantime reason staff fantastic draw financial march schedule time swallow monday described tough memory decline fourteen patron viability discus extend dedicate family bank current bryan downtown restaurateur announcement refer big year state amount hard popular lot building pub back heart heavy accord month report money overwhelmed owner definitely announce virtually pioneer mcgonigal information street close significant positive facebook reflection open financially social barrington guide restaurant closing gathering unsuccessfully press plan message medium bar heartfelt understand loyal post shut cook generate brick fashion business sign retain work spot completely share,0.964,0.0,8.595678670360108,0.4392428751803752,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,"‘Poor Things’: Bawdy and boundary-pushing, but also revelatory",2023-12-04 14:02:00,Ann Hornaday,"Emma Stone goes for bawdy, boundary-pushing broke in “Poor Things,” a funny, unsettling, ugly, fantastically constructed cabinet of cinematic wonders. Adapted from Alasdair Gray’s novel by Tony McNamara (“The Great”) and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (who collaborated with McNamara and Stone on the antically anachronistic “The Favourite”), this time-traveling picaresque about a woman’s striding awkwardly — then fearlessly — into the modern age is that rarity among movies: a tale that begins as an off-putting exercise in fetish, only to blossom into something that’s not just shocking for its own sake, but genuinely revelatory and meaningful.Stone plays Bella, who for mysterious reasons seems to be a child trapped in a grown person’s body. In the opening sequences of “Poor Things,” filmed in chiaroscuro black-and-white, Bella is living with her surrogate father, Godwin Baxter, who has invented her, a la Frankenstein, as a case study in brain transplants. A doll-like automaton who can barely form words and plays piano with her feet, Bella is a blank slate reminiscent of Helen Keller; the dubious miracle worker here is Godwin, played by Willem Dafoe with a monomaniacal gleam in his eye and a crazy quilt of scars across his face. Bella calls Dafoe’s character “God,” a bit on the nose for someone who initially seems to be so creepily controlling that he might as well have “Toxic Man” tattooed on his stitched-up forehead. But nothing is as it seems in “Poor Things,” especially when it becomes clear that Bella won’t stay a wide-eyed naif for long.In fact, she’s learning at a canter-like pace, especially when it comes to her body’s most primal urges. It turns out that Bella enjoys physical pleasure, an impulse that sends her on a journey halfway across the world: Lisbon, an Oz-like garden of earthy delights she visits with an amoral popinjay named Duncan Wedderburn (played with hilarious bumptiousness by Mark Ruffalo); Alexandria, where Bella encounters poverty, injustice and perfidy for the first time; and Paris, where she finds sexual self-discovery and financial autonomy in a whorehouse run by an eccentric madam named Swiney (the fabulous Kathryn Hunter, last seen deploying her incantatory powers in Joel Coen’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth”).The aesthetic roots of “Poor Things” extend from Charles Dickens and Mary Shelley to George Bernard Shaw and Erica Jong; from Vivienne Westwood to Jules Verne; and from Terry Gilliam to Jean-Pierre Jeunet. As Bella comes into her own, the film blooms into a fanciful riot of color, textures and points of view; Lanthimos likes to use canted camera angles and concave frames, giving the entire enterprise the feeling of a voyeuristic, barely controlled whirligig. Visually, “Poor Things” is an unalloyed treat: Even spectators who might cringe at the gouged eyes and spatchcocked cadavers in God’s lab (not to mention a disquieting scene involving Bella and an errant apple) will delight in its deliciously exaggerated costumes and decor. Retro-futurist Victoriana and storybook whimsy abound, from Bella’s gothic-chic wardrobe to God’s Moreauvian menagerie of animal experiments gone awry.Because McNamara wrote the script, “Poor Things” brims with his signature polished, sophisticated humor; because Lanthimos directed, it’s full of envelope-pushing zaniness and self-amusement, especially when it comes to Bella’s increasingly uninhibited sexual appetites. This is where “Poor Things” enters ambiguous territory. As thoroughly committed as Stone is to the bit, there are moments when viewers might wonder for whose benefit she’s baring it all so bravely. As real ideas begin to overtake Bella’s hedonistic instinct, the idea of her finding agency through hyper-sexualization admittedly feels freeing, but also undeniably gratifying for the men looking through the lens.This is Hollywood, after all, so “Poor Things” demands to have its kinky cake and feminist allegory, too. The film’s central contradiction is that the more outlandish the story becomes, the more grounded it is in women’s seemingly eternal struggles around power, selfhood and constricting social norms. As Bella careers into a new century, her journey morphs into a fable about the getting of wisdom — along with pleasure, empathy and joy. With a little sex, of course (op. cit.: Hollywood). Actually, with a whole lot of it. But, when “Poor Things” is firing on all its subversive steampunk cylinders, also with much more.",4465,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/12/04/poor-things-movie-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,monomaniacal keller living amoral delight menagerie awkwardly terry construct earthy tragedy costume trap social jong rarity modern central learn sends wedderburn toxic entire deliciously turn barely signature coen surrogate chiaroscuro woman riot control pace hunter baring alasdair god naif commit macbeth shock humor yorgos instinct vivienne cake whorehouse admittedly hilarious root wardrobe swiney agency verne free age blossom reminiscent camera especially anachronistic sophisticated tony voyeuristic paris creepily sake treat funny point stride hedonistic run ugly nose helen financial duncan stay whirligig cadaver play zaniness eye scar played miracle wisdom steampunk blank brim struggle erica halfway visit transplant territory broke morphs fire form ground father unalloyed full mention frankenstein westwood word victoriana cylinder journey gray mysterious world encounter direct jules bloom fantastically worker write joel frame selfhood movie incantatory fact decor lisbon uninhibited poor quilt power person lanthimos enterprise slate bumptiousness emma joy george reason charles aesthetic century fanciful moreauvian revelatory angle clear call bit madam wonder sexual story feminist foot favourite visually picaresque study give poverty career time benefit character injustice kathryn crazy apple hollywood appetite spatchcock whimsy stone impulse collaborate color overtake view find bernard enjoys film dafoe bravely brain bella experiment demand extend sequence fable deploy contradiction popinjay real constrict mark forehead shelley exaggerated godwin abound grown opening ruffalo alexandria automaton cabinet dubious script involve cringe dickens viewer fetish bawdy mcnamara subversive initially outlandish urge polished storybook empathy primal case allegory lab begin kinky physical child seemingly eccentric gilliam piano unsettle norm gratify jeunet moment antically cinematic sex body willem feel garden spectator undeniably baxter eternal idea adapt increasingly gleam disquiet pleasure perfidy shaw course great mary fabulous lot gouge animal genuinely exercise texture scene enters tattooed autonomy invent errant ambiguous fearlessly concave,0.9826,0.2687569988801792,9.36200700116686,0.5760859197299876,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Look of the Week: Selena Gomez reminds us of the elegance of elbow gloves,2023-12-04 14:00:00,not specified,"At the 2023 Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles last night, not one, but three celebrities arrived in a decidedly retro accessory: Evening gloves. Both Selena Gomez, dressed in Valentino, and Cara Delevigne (wearing Del Core) stepped out in classic black opera gloves, while Jared Leto’s red leather pair — although presumably not elbow-length — peaked out from under his white Givenchy poplin shirt.First popularized in the 16th century, the opera glove (usually categorized as being between 19 and 23 inches in length) has long been a dependable garment to elevate and exaggerate any ensemble.Traditionally made of soft kid leather and lined with silk, gloves were once a carefully considered status symbol — and the more embellished the better. Queen Elizabeth I reportedly wore a pair stitched with two inches of gold fringe. Part of the historical allure, too, was that gloves preserved the modesty of the wearer (a key virtue of the 1500s, especially for women) acting as a physical barrier to touch.The noble and ladylike connotations of elbow-length gloves only persisted over the millennium. In fact, during Hollywood’s Golden Age, they were a vital part of Marilyn Monroe’s seductive charm. While performing the iconic musical number “Diamonds are a Girl’s Best Friend” from the 1953 film “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” Monroe matches her strapless, hot pink satin gown with a pair of opera gloves — festooned with dazzling bracelets, much like Gomez’s Gala look.It was a powerful example of sartorial subversion: seeing Monroe, a contemporary “sex bomb,” in the chaste and maidenly accessory (not to mention teamed with the bustier dress) winked at fashion history and its repressive attitudes towards sex.Today, the item is experiencing a renaissance — appearing on the arms of Bella Hadid, Anne Hathaway, Olivia Rodrigo, Zoë Kravitz, Emma D’Arcy, Mia Goth and more. Though they are still donned by royalty (just last week the Duchess of Cambridge wore a pair of white elbow gloves by Paula Rowan to a state dinner at Buckingham Palace) the versatility of the evening glove makes it a surprisingly playful piece.For its latest Fall-Winter 2023 campaign, Versace dressed down a pair of black croc-effect leather elbow gloves with blue denim jeans. Similarly, at the 2022 Met Gala actor Kodi Smit-McPhee arrived in a firetruck red pair of Bottega Veneta leather opera gloves scrunched under the sleeve of a white pinstripe shirt and jeans.

Washington Post,6 days national parks are free to visit in 2024,2023-12-04 13:48:00,Natalie B. Compton,"To help with your 2024 travel planning, the National Park Service has announced its annual list of free entrance days. The six days are split between seasons and offered as a way of giving Americans cost-friendly vacation options. Normally, entering one the 63 national parks in the U.S. costs between $10 to $35.“If an entrance fee is a barrier to anybody visiting, we want to be able to take that away on certain days throughout the year to encourage people to go and visit a park maybe they’ve never been to before,” said National Park Service spokesperson Kathy Kupper.In 2024, the entrance fee-free dates will take place on what Kupper calls days of celebration and commemoration, from national holidays to park-specific ones. Here’s the list:Visitors on fee-free days will still have to pay for services and amenities such as camping reservations, boat launches and special tours. If you can’t make it on these particular dates, there are still more than 300 national park sites — including national monuments, historical places, seashores and trails — that are always free to visit.“The majority of national parks are free to enter every day,” Kupper said. “Currently, there’s 109 of the 400-plus that have an entrance fee.”For inspiration on which parks to visit, download The Washington Post’s podcast “Field Trip” on your favorite podcast app. The show follows host Lillian Cunningham to five iconic parks from New Mexico’s White Sands to Alaska’s Gates of the Arctic, digging into their histories and challenges. You can also read By The Way travel guides, written by locals, for Yosemite, Glacier and Everglades.Kupper said parks near major metros — like Shenandoah National Park near D.C., or Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California — tend to get the biggest spike in traffic on fee-free days. “It’s an incentive to the populations nearby to choose that day to go and visit a nearby park,” she said.Harder-to-reach, bucket-list parks like Glacier National Park in Montana or Big Bend National Park in Texas don’t see the same influx because they’re less likely to get the jump-in-the-car-and-go visitor.“When you’re planning a large-scale trip like that, the entrance fees are so minimal,” Kupper said. “For instance, Yellowstone is $35 for the week for everybody in your vehicle. So it’s not enough to make you say, ‘Let’s fly across the country and go to Yellowstone because we’d save the $35 entrance fee.’”To avoid some of the crazier crowds that can plague the country’s most popular parks — particularly in the busy summer months — consider seeing some of these still-spectacular alternatives.Instead of Yellowstone National Park, for example, you can head to Bison Range nature reserve near Missoula, Mont., where you’ll see most of the same wildlife with the exception of wolves and grizzly bears. Or instead of Zion National Park, try Capitol Reef National Park, one of the country’s newer parks that has striking geologic wonders and a fraction of the visitors.If you’re going with a baby, we have a beginner’s guide for you. Start by planning your trip with adjusted expectations, like beginning your days gently and accepting that you’ll likely cover less ground.Whether you’re going with a family or not, be sure to do your homework well before your trip.

CNN,Director of Nicaragua’s Miss Universe franchise charged with plotting to overthrow the government,2023-12-04 13:43:00,Abel Alvarado,"Nicaraguan police have charged the director of the local Miss Universe franchise with conspiracy, treason, money laundering and spreading fake news as part of a plot to overthrow the government, weeks after the Central American nation’s first victory in the pageant.Karen Celebertti and two others have been accused of participating in “terrorist actions of a failed coup attempt” in 2018, when Nicaraguans protested against President Daniel Ortega’s attempted reforms to the country’s social security system.Police said Celebertti had used “innocent beauty contests” to turn the “competitions into political traps and ambushes, financed by foreign agents.”They said they have “telephone and technological memories” to be used as evidence against her.Celebertti did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The shock move came after Sheynnis Palacios won the global pageant on November 18, becoming the first Nicaraguan to do so.On November 23, Celebertti and her daughter were refused entry into Nicaragua and returned to Mexico, from where they had departed. They were not told why they were refused entry, a source close to the matter told CNN.Celebertti was in Mexico and Miami for Miss Universe-related activities after the pageant.CNN has reached out to the Miss Universe for comment on the charges. The organization said they may be able to provide a comment “later.”The day before Celebertti was denied entry, Rosario Murillo, the country’s Vice President and the wife of Ortega, referred cryptically to the country’s “new victories.”Without referring to the pageant or Celebertti by name, Murillo said in Nicaragua “snakes have no space, they have no place.”“To the vain, crazy and evil, stop taking advantage of so much beauty, joy and talent in Nicaragua. Stop manipulating the well-deserved triumphs of a pretty girl to hide your insignificance and inability,” she added.",1891,https://www.cnn.com/style/nicaragua-miss-universe-conspiracy-charges/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204072352-01-miss-universe-competition-2023.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,innocent joy sheynnis treason source advantage country daughter trap social week organization hide terrorist beauty central political inability refuse action competition turn coup crazy nation universe comment american shock global celebertti depart rosario refer fail insignificance vice charge fake nicaragua president respond money local conspiracy security pretty telephone snake add nicaraguan vain laundering immediately request accuse technological evil participate miami wife mexico return franchise provide reach daniel activity entry finance police memory stop day overthrow miss victory part triumph reform close director matter deny plot pageant manipulate girl cryptically government murillo move space told news spread attempt contest palacios talent evidence ambush ortega protest november foreign,-0.96425,0.3172924378635642,11.493958944281523,0.4018037518037518,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Robert Downey Jr. won’t be returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Tony Stark,2023-12-04 13:43:00,Lisa Respers France,"Marvel fans shouldn’t be checking for Robert Downey Jr. to reprise his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man in the Marvel universe.Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige revealed in an interview with Vanity Fair that despite reports otherwise, there are no plans to resurrect the character after Downey Jr.’s last appearance in 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame.”“We are going to keep that moment and not touch that moment again,” Feige said. “We all worked very hard for many years to get to that, and we would never want to magically undo it in any way.”Downey Jr. was hesitant to even do reshoots for “Endgame,” according to the film’s co-director Joe Russo.“We’d already said tearful goodbyes on the last day of shooting. Everybody had moved on emotionally,” Russo told publication. “We promised him it would be the last time we made him do it — ever.”His brother Anthony Russo, who co-directed “Endgame,” added, “That was a difficult thing for him to do, to come back to pick up that line.”“When he (Downey Jr.) did come back, we were shooting on a stage directly opposite where he auditioned for Tony Stark,” Anthony Russo said. “So his last line as Tony Stark was shot literally a couple hundred feet from his original audition that got him the role.”According to Feige, he had to advocate for Downey Jr. to win the role of Stark in the Marvel franchise because of his past struggles with substance abuse that led to him serving 15 months in prison.“It purely came down to the Marvel board being nervous at putting all of their chips in their future films on somebody who famously had those legal troubles in the past,” Feige said. “I wasn’t very good—and I’m still not great—at taking no for an answer. But I also don’t pound my chest to try to get my way. I try to figure out ways to make it as clear to other people why we should head in a direction. And that’s when the idea of a screen test came up.”Downey Jr.’s wife, producer Susan Downey, said her husband has turned down roles similar to Stark over the years. And in 2018, Downey Jr. told the Vanity Fair writer Anthony Breznican that despite attempts to compare him to the character, he’s his own man.“I ain’t him, I’ll tell you that flat out,” Downey Jr. said at the time.",2221,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/entertainment/robert-downey-jr-iron-man-marvel/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220413113637-03-lisa-france-headshots.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,literally report chest kevin purely clear plan couple marvel foot time fair despite character make husband advocate turn directly future similar interview susan touch head compare film tearful anthony nervous stage chip role substance back legal president undo trouble hard abuse downey flat tony studio add board serve difficult month feige famously vanity wife stark franchise resurrect publication accord writer past reveal breznican line brother day year original struggle shoot work promise russo moment endgame screen direction hundred check audition move goodbye idea told appearance robert avenger lead producer attempt pick reshoots hesitant answer pound test shot reprise opposite joe figure emotionally put magically win,0.1173,0.2701485817199459,5.66332648870636,0.4399101307189543,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Monkey business with the B-52s at the Miami art shows,2023-12-04 13:43:00,Alexandra Peers,"Spread over a dozen islands off the east coast of central Florida, there’s a huge, but little-known animal sanctuary. Open to the public two days a year, it is the roaming home to 266 chimpanzees rescued from medical research, pet cages and Hollywood productions. It’s also home to dozens of paintings. Not of the animals, but by them, in collaboration with, even more unexpectedly, members of art pop group the B-52s.“Save the Chimps!” explains Kate Pierson, longtime singer with the 80’s-era band, is her passion project, and her devotion to animal welfare goes way back. “In 1988, I got up on the stage at the Animal Rights Music Festival at the Washington Monument holding the hand of a big chimp. It was surreal. I felt a connection.”Pierson, emblematic for her bright red, rocket-ship hairdo, rose to fame with a quartet of performers best known for the song “LoveShack” and a cult-like fan following. The B-52s broke out of the Athens, Georgia, music scene in the late 1970s and went on to become “the quintessential party band,” according to “Rolling Stone.”They discovered Save the Chimps after Dan Mathews, a director of the sanctuary, went backstage after a concert last year and invited Pierson to see it. The sanctuary “is acres and acres,” said Pierson, and a lush, grassy home to its great apes. “Some of them climb, some of them like lolling around in hammocks — then there are the chimps that want to paint.”Now, to raise money for the sanctuary, the joint works created by the B-52s (who prime the primates’ canvases in the colors of the band’s album covers) and the chimp artists (who do the rest) go on sale December 6 at the Spectrum Art Fair in Miami Beach. A couple dozen of the abstract collaborations will be offered, priced between $1,000 to $5,000. All proceeds go to the charity.The fair takes place during Art Basel Miami Beach and Miami Art week, blockbuster art and culture events that draw hundreds of thousand people to the beachside city every December from all over the world.It’s nearly impossible to get attention to your event during the packed week: Corporate sponsors, luxury retailers and publicists trying to get on the radar of the monied, global clientele in attendance have organized custom balloon rides, staged burlesque queen Dita Von Teese riding a giant lipstick and chartered yachts with DJ sets from Drake. But this event is in a league of its own.“We had to come up with something really unique to get people’s attention,” Dan Mathews of Save the Chimps told CNN of the simian showcase.At first, giving Save the Chimps a free booth at the fair seemed like a feel-good stunt, according to Eric Smith, owner of the Spectrum fair. Then he watched a video of Vanilla, a chimp who had spent decades in a cage, seeing the sky for the first time at the sanctuary — and going nuts with joy. It “grabbed my heartstrings,” said Smith, who owns five other art fairs around the country.Smith declined to address the artistic value of the chimps’ paintings, but notes, “Kate attracts people who might not see an art fair.”Now 75, Pierson is, like her fellow septagenarians Cher and Dolly Parton, having a bit of a renaissance. Her band just finished up a residency at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, and attended a dinner at the White House in October. And although the band has done a “Farewell Tour,” don’t believe it — they’re doing another set of shows at the Venetian in April 2024.“We never expected to last, to have long careers,” Pierson told CNN. It’s kind of crazy that we are still going… we haven’t been the hardest working band in showbusiness.”Now they’re not just hard-working though, she notes — they’re multi-tasking their music and art with “Dan (Mathews) tossing the canvases at us and we’re putting paint on them” before they are brought to the chimps to weigh in.So far, they’ve raised $55,000 from sales of the works, at exhibitions in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Las Vegas, according to Mathews.Like humans who pick up different hobbies, only about one in 10 chimps at the sanctuary enjoy painting, explains Mathews, but those that do are serious about it. Forty-something chimp Cheetah is perhaps the most impassioned creative; he mixes his paint studiously, stirring with a paintbrush until he’s reached the desired shade.The chimpanzee painters have different styles — some splash paint, other use their hands, feet or brushes. As they paint, they are thoughtful, although other chimps often make fun of them, Mathews noted.But artists have always suffered critics.",4530,https://www.cnn.com/style/b52s-save-the-chimps-art-miami-show/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/kate-pierson.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,dinner believe artist felt radar artistic draw tour owner huge monied cnn couple nut week splash santa central georgia culture paintbrush beach burlesque make song fair expect decline december parton emblematic sponsor resort save longtime style decade hardest global back price brush cheetah proceeds free watch venetian thousand washington offer singer devotion collaboration stir medical studiously abstract quartet set clientele vega miami hobby long queen mexico corporate reach band member spectrum weigh party critic giant group rest athens prime hand retailer publicist red work broke painting hammock roam attendance league hold booth hundred farewell explains white follow told grassy balloon show pierson kind paint basel joint cover charter put discover attend blockbuster fame fe joy beachside cage stag october desire primate festival unique east bit rid florida pop stunt foot ape enjoy give passion career time different eric luxury vanilla public create dozen hollywood late crazy fun dolly color hairdo art painter exhibition roll finish ride home island chimp stage grabbed spent mix performer packed value mathews address april unexpectedly creative concert lush money sky bright renaissance septagenarians heartstrings quintessential loveshack simian album surreal cher open custom big sanctuary rise event teese toss smith research brought human production city accord place welfare yacht house video backstage year day attracts attention raise loll canvas music director drake residency organize note impassioned spread project fellow pick great monument thoughtful suffer dj animal invite lipstick kate acre climb rescue scene dita coast chimpanzee impossible,0.99735,0.1324503311258278,7.286695278969955,0.5404085497835497,0,2023-12-04
NPR,Rizz is Oxford's word of the year for 2023. Do you have it?,2023-12-04 13:17:00,Bill Chappell,"Sorry, Swifties. The word of the year for 2023 is ""rizz,"" according to the publishers of the Oxford English Dictionary. Rizz beat out Swiftie, situationship and de-influencing to claim word of the year honors. The competition celebrates recently created words or expressions that symbolize a period of time, while also ""having potential as a term of lasting cultural significance or providing a snapshot of social history,"" the Oxford University Press said as it announced the winner. If you're asking what ""rizz"" means, you're not alone — particularly if you're a generation or so older than Gen Z. But don't feel too left out: There's even a chance that you have rizz without actually knowing what rizz is. And like seemingly everything these days, it can also be a verb. ""Rizz is a colloquial word, defined as style, charm, or attractiveness; the ability to attract a romantic or sexual partner,"" according to the Oxford University Press. As for the word's etymology, OUP says it's believed to have been taken from the middle of ""charisma,"" much like ""fridge"" derives from refrigerator. (But that point is in dispute — see below.) People who have become linked with the term range from actor Tom Holland to sports reporter Shams Charania. ""I have no rizz whatsover,"" Holland said over the summer, sparking an online debate over the man who is famously dating Zendaya. Rizz spread like wildfire on TikTok and other platforms after influencer Kai Cenat began using the term on Twitch, where more than 8 million followers watch Cenat livestream himself playing video games, talking with celebrities, pranking his friends and just hanging out. Cenat also talks about how to approach women — and that's where rizz comes in. ""Rizz started with me and a few of my friends from back home,"" said the 21-year-old, who grew up in the Bronx, during an interview on the No Jumper podcast. Giving what he called ""the official definition,"" Cenat described a scenario in which a woman goes from being uninterested to being intrigued. Describing the situation, he added, one might say, ""Oh yeah, I rizzed her up. I got mad rizz."" Of course, it's natural for a term related to charm and mystique to resist explanation. Cenat recently said that to him, the word isn't short for anything. ""Rizz meant 'game,' "" he said on the Complex video show 360 with Speedy Morman. ""People say it's short for charisma. But like, not to me."" Oxford language experts selected rizz from a pool of eight words, weighing their cultural and linguistic heft with more than 32,000 votes from the public on social media and the Oxford Languages website. ""Rizz is a term that has boomed on social media,"" Oxford Languages President Casper Grathwohl said in a news release, ""and speaks to how language that enjoys intense popularity and currency within particular social communities — and even in some cases lose their popularity and become passé — can bleed into the mainstream."" The word beat out other timely finalists such as prompt (in the sense of guiding an AI query), and Swiftie (a Taylor Swift fan, in a massive year for the pop star). The contenders hint at our zeitgeist. While the word of 2022, ""goblin mode,"" described self-indulgence, this year's top terms center on dealing with others, from situationship (an undefined romantic relationship) to parasocial (""a crush that you have on a person that literally does not even know that you exist"" or has no clue of the attraction's intensity, as NPR's Life Kit explains). The OUP says rizz hints at the growing impact Gen Z will have on society. For his part, Cenat, an adept in the ways of the online world, acknowledges that ""rizz"" has taken on a life of its own since he popularized it. ""It went crazy internationally,"" he said earlier this year. ""Everybody's saying it now. It's just in people's vocabulary, and that's what it is."" Anyone who might be aged out/creeped out by the ""rizz"" phenomenon could entertain an alternative theory that's equally unfounded and compelling: What if the term reflects the enduring appeal of Stockard Channing's turn as Betty ""Rizz"" Rizzo, the independent and sexually clued-in icon from the 1970s film Grease? Consider this famous nighttime exchange with John Travolta's Danny Zuko in the film: Danny: ""You're looking good, Rizz."" Rizzo: ""Eat your heart out."" That, as they say, is rizz.",4347,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216950808/rizz-oxford-word-of-the-year-swiftie,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/08/07/gettyimages-1592937131_sq-96a3f84db48fe562ee7dd12cf179d6b2648aa70a-s100-c15.jpg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,zendaya believe ability hang link taylor gen prank social date romantic complex deal press derives actor influencer definition turn earlier verb talk travolta expression uninterested woman heart style livestream chance mystique dispute whatsover back select range website period friend boom appeal icon grease watch speedy age parasocial scenario cultural official finalist query zeitgeist holland language massive sexually define approach point million celebrity unfounded goblin heft mainstream entertain reporter undefined charania meant online compelling particular described john play weigh describe explanation debate phenomenon relationship swifties colloquial popularize left sport winner speaks recently kai part release tom situation rizzed internationally follower grathwohl word partner linguistic explains potential world fridge etymology twitch news npr show timely attract snapshot platform famous independent danny publisher start game community middle vote person literally related charm oxford call sexual announce pop tiktok passé exchange give situationship time history competition sorry public create channing popularity consider spark crazy bleed impact swiftie interview attraction reflect grow nighttime cenat kit eat particularly intrigue enjoys home center film theory top refrigerator intensity jumper alternative exist president dictionary bronx charisma generation crush equally endure add summer intense attractiveness casper famously currency vocabulary provide rizz accord prompt morman claim case beat video honor day year begin stockard expert contender podcast seemingly english star zuko swift acknowledges guide university short feel rizzo adept betty life resist pool society oup spread symbolize celebrates course wildfire natural significance term medium clue mad hint sham lose,0.9945,0.20703933747412,6.889500554938952,0.4095454545454545,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Will fashion ever be truly diverse?,2023-12-04 13:15:00,Rachel Tashjian,"In fashion, who is at a show — or on the runway, appearing in magazines or designing at a brand — is often just as important as who isn’t.More recently, that question has become less an incentive for catty gossip and more urgently a question of equity: why is the fashion world still so thin, White, ableist and cisgender, especially when so many of its followers and consumers are not? (A popular meme shows the headshots of the creative directors at several leading luxury brands, all of whom are White with closely cropped brown hair.) While size inclusivity and body diversity have become buzzwords, the feeling persists that models outside of the stereotypical beauty ideal must adhere to yet another set of standards.And for those who may see style as essential to the protection of their identity and comfort — for whom its power for exploration and self-presentation are part of their identity as trans, queer or disabled — what’s aspirational to one consumer can feel like a message that they simply have no place in the world of self-expression and clothes, even as fashion brands roll out products at a breakneck pace and insist that “everyone” should buy them.A major new initiative at one of the country’s leading fashion schools hopes to challenge these inequities. Parsons School of Design, the New York City-based college that has produced designers such as Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs, will launch a program for designers who identify as disabled, in conjunction with Irish writer and disability activist Sinéad Burke’s consultancy Tilting the Lens.Called the Parsons Disabled Fashion Student Program, it has a fund of more than $500,000 to recruit and mentor three incoming students across several of its fashion programs, including providing support for tuition as well as living and access costs.A group of advisers, mentors and supporters is packed with boldface names and luxury brands — mentors include model Aaron Rose Philip, who has worked with Moschino, Collina Strada and Versace, as well as Fondation Chanel’s head of finance Rachel Iseman. The Ford Foundation will support research on disabled students’ experience in fashion school, which will help shape the program and be made available to other institutions, and H&M will provide funding for the scholarship.Applications are due in March — they will be reviewed by the admissions committee for the degree program for which the student is applying as well as the program’s own selection committee, made up of disabled Parsons faculty and some advisory members — and the first three students will matriculate in the fall.For the program’s founders, this isn’t just an opportunity to make fashion more accessible but to change the way that future generations think about the function of fashion.“Fashion inherently is a practice that affirms our bodies, connects us to land and the natural environment, establishes relationships to communities, and of course is a cultural, artistic and economic field. It’s all of that,” says Ben Barry, dean of fashion at Parsons, who identifies as disabled and has been working to develop this program for three years. “I think within a colonized western context, fashion has been taken up as a form of hierarchy. A form of separating people, policing people, and creating division rather than connection.” (Take, for example, the feeling of insecurity and foolishness almost any of us, even the most fanatically fashion-forward, feel looking at a runway show.)Even fashion houses’ efforts at diversifying can fall victim to this desire for hierarchy and separation, which Burke, the founder and CEO of Tilting the Lens, hopes this program will help address. Burke is a 33-year-old Irish writer and disability activist who is widely followed for pushing for diversity and inclusion from the front row of luxury fashion shows. She has appeared on the cover of British Vogue twice, in September 2019 and this May, and was the first little person to attend the Met Gala, in 2019. She regularly attends shows such as Gucci and Burberry, and her consultancy, which she founded in 2020, has worked with brands including Starbucks, Ralph Lauren and Netflix. In many ways, she is the ultimate insider, but she also felt like she was one person being tasked with representing many.“No effort as important as equity, inclusion, accessibility, and even, shall we say, sustainability, should be reliant on one individual,” says Burke, “and shouldn’t be as malleable as, if that person leaves, there is not enough robustness within the organization that it isn’t maintained. ”Philip, who is among the program’s mentors, is a 22-year-old trans model born with cerebral palsy who has appeared on the runway for brands including Moschino and Collina Strada. She was admitted to Parsons as a teenager but couldn’t afford the tuition. “I feel like sometimes things happen in life where if you’re not able to do something for yourself, you’re able to do it for your community at large,” Philip says.She has also felt frustrated that opportunities for her, such as walking a Moschino runway show or posing with Donatella Versace, don’t lead to more opportunities for those like her. “I have my disability, I have my transness, I’m a black woman. But none of these things stop me from being able to work and do my talent the way that I am meant to because of other people’s inability to accommodate me physically.” Designers acknowledge “what it takes for me to give on the level that my White counterparts give on, my able-bodied counterparts give on,” Philip says, but often “these bigger fashion houses, that have power and leverage and money and resources, they’re so unwilling to not be ableist.”But the program also represents, frankly, a bold commitment — the ambition of which, Barry and Burke hope, will be a way of combating the tokenism seeming inherent to our era in fashion, when an initiative introduced by a creative director may be unceremoniously canceled as soon as another creative director or business leader arrives.“I knew I needed to combat any type of token or performative gesture,” says Barry, who is 40. “While I occupy this role as dean, I see my body as a vessel to create institutional change.”The school itself may require adjustments for students in the program, and Barry, who joined Parsons in July 2021, said that the program is one effort he’s made among many to diversify the school, including hiring 10 new full-time faculty members who come from “communities that have been structurally marginalized.”But Burke and Barry aren’t just thinking about the school itself: Outside of the campus, fashion houses are often in locations that are not readily accessible, especially in European fashion capitals like Paris or Milan, with its cobblestone streets and older buildings which often only have stairs.“If we think about how somebody who is a wheelchair user, somebody who is blind or low vision, somebody who’s neurodivergent, for example, may work in an atelier in Rome, in Paris, in Milan, in London — due to the infrastructure of those cities, it could be incredibly challenging, and that is without bias and mind-set,” says Burke. “So some of that work [is] to connect with these brands even from an educational and awareness perspective.”Rebecca Cokley, who works as the Ford Foundation’s first U.S. Disability Rights Program Officer, which is providing funding for the Parsons’s initiative’s research, thinks of how often what are seen as accommodations for a few lead to progress for many. “I always remind people, captions exist because disabled people demanded [them],” as do curb cuts and four-wheeled suitcases, says Conley, who is a little person. “The amount of technology and tools and apps that exist because we were segregated from something … We did that for you.”“This is very much a piece of that,” she says. “What does it mean to have disabled people regularly at Parsons? It means that non-disabled people are going to expect to see disabled people at Parsons. And then when they enter the industry, they’re going to wonder why there aren’t disabled people there. And so they’re going to be more open to having disabled people apply for internships. They’re going to be more open to thinking about how we adjust what fashion looks like, or the stitching we use or, what kind of clasps we use. It is so phenomenal to be in a role where, I tell people, I don’t get to innovate yet; I’m just trying to make things right at this point. But at the same time, understanding that the outside world does see this as innovation.”",8572,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2023/12/04/parsons-disabled-program/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,july living felt innovation tokenism model clothes artistic regularly conjunction teenager size campus tilt cerebral country type cokley attends insider burberry boldface large organization piece practice maintain division consultancy cut inability runway make tuition barry expect simply commitment occupy amount admission fashion atelier moschino bias clasp capital woman protection pace western founder adhere institutional vogue disabled ideal style burke catty frankly incentive lens gossip london role tasked magazine rebecca individual technology college chanel infrastructure comfort iseman message incoming cultural experience user unwilling especially thin paris transness accommodate tool inherently hope point accessible represent support push apps cancel set exploration meant effort hair leverage afford breakneck hierarchy vision member writer segregate aspirational major require knew relationship school conley initiative group police leader hire stop faculty land due connects september recently incredibly part tom dean work sinéad join reliant building form found follower gucci pose degree leaf vessel field frustrate white essential advisory low world follow develop fondation accommodation milan show kind talent neurodivergent enter curb diversify important gala foundation innovate disability parson admit buy community cover institution launch student happen power attend person lauren fund ford performative desire foolishness phenomenal produce suitcase wonder rome popular beauty sustainability ralph counterpart affirms give time context luxury create ceo malleable business future mentor netflix aaron robustness versace front access cobblestone connect officer readily roll resource street head diversity establishes insecurity queer activist palsy demand internship rachel black packed recruit exist address wheelchair change creative victim consumer economic money token stereotypical jacob generation inclusivity blind progress identity insist opportunity meme persists big open selection ableist educational question rise walk british equity starbucks introduce unceremoniously inclusion research york provide strada cropped city closely place funding awareness available march separate philip stitch inherent headshot challenge house location finance accessibility understand year supporter apply identifies remind acknowledge matriculate bold adjust director row donatella structurally ultimate committee level industry identify design body include fanatically product widely feel brand program shape life caption lead combat gesture irish urgently european course collina designer natural brown born trans colonize inequity adviser separation marc buzzword fall ambition cisgender function review environment adjustment,0.99185,0.0699953336444237,8.670231729055256,0.4333732233498586,0,2023-12-04
NPR,Longtime 'Fresh Air' contributor Dave Davies signs off (sort of),2023-12-04 12:45:00,Terry Gross,"After 22 years of interviews, longtime Fresh Air contributor and fill-in host Dave Davies is cutting back on his workload. For years Davies has contributed at least one interview a week to Fresh Air, and oftentimes more — especially when the topics concern sports, investigative journalism or history. Davies is always thinking about the experience of the listener. ""If ... something isn't clear because the guest is using shorthand for something or it's just not quite working, you have to intervene in some way to make sure the audience stays with it,"" he says. ""The audience is always in your mind."" A native of Lubbock, Texas, Davies grew up in Corpus Christi and moved to Philadelphia in 1975, where he initially worked as a taxi driver and a welder. In 1982, he found his way to the WHYY newsroom, covering local politics and government. He left in 1986 for stints at KYW Newsradio and the Philadelphia Daily News, but returned to public radio doing free-lance gigs, including Fresh Air interviews, beginning in 2001. Though Davies occasionally hears a Philly accent creep into his speech, you're unlikely to find a trace of Texas in his voice — either on-air or in real life. Dave Davies stands outside of the Fresh Air studio in Philadelphia with a collection of press passes from over the years. Molly Seavy-Nesper/WHYY hide caption Dave Davies stands outside of the Fresh Air studio in Philadelphia with a collection of press passes from over the years. ""I remember in junior high and high school being aware that the people on television, like the newscasters, spoke this standard English,"" Davies says. ""And I kind of I just decided to do that."" Davies is not signing off completely from WHYY. You'll still hear him interviewing guests on Fresh Air -- just less frequently. And, of course, he'll continue to bring his A-game to the listeners. ""The one thing that I've done from the beginning is to really prepare very, very thoroughly for every interview because there's a standard here, right?"" he says.

CNN,Now you can visit a real-life ‘Hobbit Hole’ in New Zealand,2023-12-04 12:41:00,Francesca Street,"The sweeping landscapes of New Zealand are, for many “Lord of the Rings” fans, inextricably linked to the fictional land of Middle‑earth.And while the home of the Hobbits was the product of author J.R.R. Tolkien’s imagination – and therefore sadly off limits to tourists – the Hobbiton Movie Set provides a pretty good substitute.Once a sheep farm southwest of the town of Matamata in the Waikato region, in 1998 a visit from “Lord of the Rings” director Peter Jackson put this unassuming location firmly on the movie map. The farm – located about two hours south of Auckland on the North Island – became the backdrop to the three original “Lord of the Rings” movies, as well as the subsequent Hobbit trilogy.The Hobbit sets – mostly facades built into landscaped hillsides – have operated as a tourist attraction in some capacity since 2002, but until recently most of the Hobbit Holes have been out of bounds to visitors.Now, two fully decorated Hobbit Holes have opened to the public for the first time. Expect interiors expertly recreated by the skilled illustrators and designers who worked on the movies, evoking the cozy, welcoming spirit of a hobbit’s home.In a statement, director Peter Jackson said Hobbiton remains his favorite “Lord of the Rings” movie location, and expressed his delight at the fact the Hobbit Holes are now open to visitors.“There’s a sense of curiosity when you’re at Hobbiton and desire to venture beyond the door, but of course it’s remained closed, until now,” he said. “The team have done a fantastic job bringing the experience to life. It looks like it’s been lifted straight out of the pages of […] Tolkien’s book.”Exploring the Hobbit Holes is now included as part of the Hobbiton tour experience. Travelers will be invited to explore one of two holes, which are described as each having a “slightly different footprint” but both “designed to provide our visitors with an identical experience.”Each hole features what Hobbiton calls a “labyrinth of fully themed rooms” – entry hall, bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, dining room, pantry and parlor. The level of authentic detail should delight “Lord of the Rings” fans, who are invited to linger and explore each space – although taller guests may have to crouch a little.The Hobbiton movie set tour costs $120 NZ (around $74 USD) for adults and $60 NZ (around $37 USD) for children aged 17 and under.If you’re planning a LOTR-themed New Zealand pilgrimage, there are plenty of other destinations to visit once you’ve ticked off Hobbiton. The New Zealand tourism board proudly states that filming took place in over 150 locations across the country’s North and South Islands.Highlights include Tongariro Alpine Crossing on the North Island – a big day trek that takes in Mount Ngauruhoe (which doubled up as Mount Doom). Travelers can also enjoy skiing on the North Island on Mount Ruapehu, which also stood in for Mount Doom and parts of Mordor.UK-based “Lord of the Rings” fan Conor McNish-Lane, now in his early 30s, told CNN Travel he looks back fondly on a trip to New Zealand taken when he was a teenager.“I loved seeing how much the country embraced what many around the globe consider to be the greatest movie trilogy in film history,” he said.McNish-Lane enjoyed spotting locations recognizable from the “Lord of the Rings.” A particular highlight was a day spent at Mount Sunday, near the Rangitata River in Hakatere Conservation Park in southern New Zealand, which doubled up as the Home of Edoras.“It was an incredible walk in a very remote location around the Home of Edoras - Rohan’s capital city - where in the movies, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf meet with King Théoden,” recalled McNish-Lane.“There were no actual structures on Mount Sunday left as they were temporary builds at the time for the movies but there was a plaque to acknowledge what had taken place and you could just really feel and sense the incredible atmosphere and why they chose the location.”From Mount Sunday, hikers can also admire Dry Creek Quarry, the site used as Helm’s Deep.“For any LOTR fans out there, they’ll know that the people of Rohan take a long and treacherous walk to Helm’s Deep which sets the stage for the final epic battle of the second movie, ‘The Two Towers,’” said McNish-Lane.“What fans may not know is that you can easily see the site of Helm’s Deep - which was also a temporary structure built on the side of a nearby mountain in the valley - from Mount Sunday, as they’re actually quite close.”McNish-Lane didn’t make it to Hobbiton on his previous trip, but the news that the site’s expanded and the Hobbit Holes have opened up has him daydreaming about future adventures.“I live in London and I’m 32 now so it’s been a long time since I was in NZ,” he said. “Of all the movie sets in the world, reading about Hobbiton makes me want to hop on a plane and take that long journey back to Middle-earth.”CNN’s Thomas Page contributed to this article",4953,https://www.cnn.com/travel/hobbiton-movie-location-opens-hobbit-holes-new-zealand/index.html,https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/hobbiton-bagshot-teasers-sjp-1.jpg?c=16x9,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,contribute sunday favorite linger delight rohan guest tolkien tour link planning dry country cnn quarry daydream detail subsequent creek traveler conor team tourist hiker valley make operate expect fantastic slightly capital express aragorn recreate previous river build remain ticked embrace alpine trek tower hall jackson waikato region park admire live recognizable feature london backdrop expertly back legolas nz age room experience crouch sweep remains ngauruhoe venture tongariro theme spirit spot board identical set authentic long south particular described fully tourism trip mountain cross doom interior lotr pilgrimage article left land locate visit recently lift part work incredible cozy early ring state journey space world told atmosphere news battle statement movie lord remote treacherous fact skilled travel plenty sheep firmly capacity final king southwest fondly taller put parlor southern chose labyrinth visitor fictional globe desire cost bedroom call straight sadly mount enjoy time history different imagination public stood evoke consider future pantry nearby side attraction trilogy explore hole bring actual home island gandalf film recall destination meet stage north page spent plane hour love site inextricably double gimli illustrator helm pretty hobbit town open big curiosity built proudly edoras hillside walk rangitata reading provide city place entry highlight landscape location bound hop limit decorate day original unassuming child acknowledge bathroom close director easily level epic welcome kitchen zealand design include product feel footprint plaque auckland life thomas temporary deep author skiing job course hakatere great structure designer farm ruapehu map usd adult invite expand hobbiton matamata facade conservation théoden,0.9951,0.1817080557238037,8.070950950950948,0.4487086247086245,0,2023-12-04

CNN,Will Smith talks about the ‘monster’ of fame and what’s next for him in Hollywood,2023-12-04 12:41:00,Marianne Garvey,"Will Smith is reflecting on the dangers of fame.Smith spoke at the Red Sea International Film Festival in Saudi Arabia on Saturday, where he described fame as “a unique monster” that he’s tried to be “careful” around.He continued: “You can’t get excited when everybody is saying good things about you, because the more you take when people are saying good things about you, the more hurt you’re gonna be when people are saying bad things about you.”Smith added that his mission going forward is to be “clear about who I am and what I am attempting to do in the world.”“I can’t need others to applaud for me to stay focused on my mission. I have always wanted to put good into the world,” he said. “I have always wanted to make people smile. I have always been devoted to the process of joy and inspiration.”The Oscar winner said that he has been “humbled” after he slapped comedian Chris Rock on stage at the 2022 Academy Awards, adding he now feels “deeply inspired to perfect my light.”“And that’s what this next phase of my life is going to be, perfecting and shining my light as brightly as I can, on as many people as I can,” he said.",1139,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/entertainment/will-smith-oscars-fame/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220406114659-marianne-garvey.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,continued excite joy stay festival oscar academy spoke unique clear smith rock described focus saudi slap arabia award deeply make smile perfect international light winner red reflect gon mission devote chris monster film phase stage process shin feel brightly life world forward comedian attempt humble add inspire danger saturday careful applaud put fame hurt,0.9901,0.5267778753292361,5.309291338582678,0.5238095238095238,0,2023-12-04
CNN,‘The Gilded Age’ is the least dramatic drama on TV — and that’s why fans love it,2023-12-04 12:41:00,Scottie Andrew,"“The Gilded Age” is, according to those who watch and discuss it, “the best show on television,” “high camp,” “the most experimental show on TV” or “objectively not good.”No matter where they fall on the spectrum of appreciation, though, many a “Gilded Age” viewer wouldn’t dare miss an episode. (“The Gilded Age” airs on HBO, which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.)When “The Gilded Age” premiered, critics and viewers didn’t quite know what to make of it. It shared critical DNA with “Downton Abbey,” namely the involvement of series creator Julian Fellowes, but, some reviews noted, lacked the previous show’s dramatic heft and reliable writing.Though it starred prestige drama veterans Carrie Coon and Christine Baranski and Broadway stars like Audra McDonald, Donna Murphy and Kelli O’Hara, many critics agreed that the series felt far less substantial than its predecessor: The New York Times called its first season a “dime-store ‘Downton.’”But in its second, and, as CNN critic Brian Lowry noted, possibly final season, many viewers have tuned into its very specific, soapy wavelength where even the highest stakes don’t feel that serious. The eloquent insults Baranski’s Agnes van Rhijn hurls at everyone in her orbit, the show’s flimsy commitment to historical accuracy, the delightful mundanity of its drama — all are charming to those who have accepted that “Downton,” this is not.There’s the season-premiere reveal that the niece of old-money matriarch Agnes is teaching watercolor painting to children, a ghastly profession that would shame their family should it become public. There’s the sudden wedding between Cynthia Nixon’s spinster-no-more and a priest, during which her widowed sister makes a late, show-stopping entrance. And there’s the reappearance of a conniving lady’s maid — who last season attempted to seduce nouveau riche tycoon George Russell — now married to an old millionaire and conspiring to spoil a soup.It’s seemingly inconsequential stuff that wouldn’t even crack the B-story of another drama in its time slot. But that’s how its fans like it.“You don’t need a fungi that makes people zombies or an army of undead approaching middle age kingdoms to make a show compelling, and this show proves that,” said Nirupam Dhakal, a writer and filmmaker and prolific TikTok chronicler of “Gilded Age” goings-on. “Sometimes all you need is Christine Baranski crossing the street furiously to keep us on the edge of our seats.”Though it took some time, it seems “The Gilded Age” has finally found its ideal audience — those who find comfort and pleasure in its snowglobe of a series, where soup and street-crossings can be as consequential as an ill-fated automobile ride.Many “Gilded Age” viewers tuned in because they were fans of Fellowes’ “Downton Abbey,” a respected PBS hit depicting the upstairs-downstairs affairs in the massive home of a British aristocratic family. But many of those fans quickly realized that this show wasn’t straining to resemble “Downton Abbey” in anything other than genre.“It’s a little preposterous, but that’s what it’s supposed to be,” said Robert Khederian, a New York City real estate agent and Gilded Age architecture enthusiast who initially didn’t enjoy the show. “I can’t really describe it any other way than compulsively watchable and total frivolity.”Khederian has, on TikTok, poked gentle fun at the show for its various historical inaccuracies that initially distracted and irritated him and fellow history buffs. But once he leaned into its preoccupation with the seemingly unimportant squabbles between New York’s wealthiest families, it quickly became his most-anticipated series of the week.“Now we’re very aware of how, in so many words, silly the show is,” Khederian told CNN. “You have to sign onto the fact that it’s not going to be this kind of cultural or intellectual juggernaut. It’s the TV version of a beach read.”Khederian, a fan of both series, noted that both “Downton” and “The Gilded Age” feature storylines revolving around ruining a soup. But where one of “Downton’s” soup story felt genuinely suspenseful — a chauffeur plans to douse a military official at dinner with a “soup” containing cow dung — “Gilded Age’s” soup snafu is neatly averted, he said.Turner, the former lady’s maid and new member of the wealthy elite, conspires with her former coworkers to ruin the soup at a dinner her former employer Bertha Russell is hosting for a British duke. Before it makes its way anywhere near its intended target, kitchen staff realize the soup has been spoiled and fire those responsible. (Fellowes clearly has an affinity for his characters using soup as a weapon of sorts.)But “The Gilded Age’s” propensity for introducing an issue and quickly solving it is part of the delight of watching it, noted Rachel Shukert, showrunner of Netflix’s “The Babysitter’s Club” adaptation and a producer on “Glow” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” She wrote in November that the HBO series “takes everything we have been told constitutes “good storytelling” and gleefully does the exact opposite.“Watching it feels like freedom,” she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Like how kids play with dolls.”Fan participation started to pick up with the premiere of “The Gilded Age’s” second season. TikTok critics like Dhakal started encouraging their many followers to watch the show and dissect the sisterly relationship between Agnes and Ada or join the fan club of Aurora Fane, whom Dhakal called the “Lady Gaga of ‘The Gilded Age’” for her proximity to gay stars of the period, like Oscar Wilde, who makes a delightful surprise appearance on the second season.For the show’s often-light touch, the performances are uniformly committed, Dhakal told CNN. They praised an emotional scene between Denée Benton and Audra McDonald, who play mother and daughter, after Benton’s Peggy, a Black writer from an affluent family, decided to take on a journalism project in the South. (Peggy is often saddled with the series’ most weighty storylines.)Even if most of the series’ plots or lack thereof can feel thin, Fellowes knows how to build a lived-in world, said Dave Winchell, who co-hosts the podcast “Lords of Grantham” about “The Gilded Age,” “The Crown” and other historical dramas. Take Nathan Lane’s Ward McAllister, a Southern gentleman and social kingmaker who attempts to avoid detection while crossing the horse feces-laden street between mansions.“A hammy Southern gentleman airdropped into New York society might feel absolutely absurd in another show, but Julian has great control over how his characters interact with robber barons and socialites and opera singers to the point where you forget that McAllister sounds the way he sounds,” Winchell told CNN.There are plenty of “misfit toys” like McAllister on “The Gilded Age,” Winchell noted, each with their own curious story that don’t appear to figure into the wider world of the show (like house staffer Jack Trotter, consistently tinkering with an alarm clock in the background).

Spotify is not an exception to these realities,” Ek wrote in a letter to staff posted to the company’s website.Spotify’s changes aim to make the company more efficient, taking it back to its startup roots after a massive hiring and spending spree helped it gain tens of millions of subscribers — but didn’t make it consistently profitable.Ek said the firm had debated making smaller job cuts next year and in 2025. “Yet, considering the gap between our financial goal state and our current operational costs, I decided that a substantial action to right-size our costs was the best option to accomplish our objectives,” he added.“To be blunt, many smart, talented and hard-working people will be departing us.”Ek said one-on-one meetings with impacted staff would take place before the end of the day Tuesday. Employees will receive around five months of severance pay on average.Spotify (SPOT), which employs more than 9,000 people, laid off more than 500 employees in January, joining a slew of tech companies — including Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) — in slashing headcount as the global economy slowed. And in June, Spotify cut 200 employees from its podcasting unit.Major tech companies went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic to keep up with a surge in demand from households and businesses for services such as online shopping and videoconferencing. But since then, inflation and rising interest rates have weighed on consumer spending, squeezed the supply of debt and equity funding, and made it costlier, leading many of them to announce deep job cuts.While Spotify has enjoyed “robust growth” over the past year, the company has become “less efficient” and moved away from the “resourcefulness” that defined its early days as a tech start-up, Ek said.Too many people are dedicated to support work rather than focused on delivering for content creators and consumers, he added.Despite adding 6 million subscribers in the June-to-September period — 2 million more than the company had forecast — Spotify eked out a profit of just €32 million ($34.8 million) in that time. That was up from a loss of €228 million ($248 million) in the same period last year. The company has 226 million subscribers in total.“We still have a ways to go before we are both productive and efficient… we have to become relentlessly resourceful,” Ek said.“This is not a step back; it’s a strategic reorientation… A reduction of this size will make it necessary to change the way we work, and we will share much more about what this will mean in the days and weeks ahead.”",2859,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/tech/spotify-layoffs-third-round/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230612141828-hanna-ziady.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,startup share smart lay decide current cost size tech interest shopping firm company goal week reality announce focus enjoy robust cut msft time action make videoconferencing microsoft household ceo business consider impact option blunt capital shift deliver exception post ahead global depart amzn demand back expensive root content period step receive change consumer economic ten spotify slew tuesday severance service eked small relentlessly add massive define consistently million spot growth support financial month rise dedicate staff subscriber gap reduce equity loss debt objective online june strategy january daniel place weigh funding past squeeze debate dramatically away significant economy employee hire strategic day year operational resourcefulness headcount podcast inflation costlier creator work reduction join letter early slash rate pandemic spree include amazon state move slow spending lead deep pay job employ surge aim write efficient profit resourceful round accomplish forecast substantial productive meeting talented supply monday laid,0.9826,0.2098635886673662,9.52961467889908,0.4228422619047619,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Billie Eilish says she ‘didn’t realize people didn’t know’ about her sexuality,2023-12-04 11:40:00,Jack Guy,"Pop star Billie Eilish has confirmed that she accidentally came out in a recent interview with Variety magazine.Speaking on the red carpet at a Variety event in Los Angeles on Saturday, the 21-year-old Grammy award-winner said she didn’t want to make a big deal out of revealing her sexual preferences.Asked by the red carpet interviewer whether she intended to come out in the cover article, which was published in November, Eilish replied: “No, I didn’t. But I kind of thought, ‘Wasn’t it obvious?’”“I didn’t realize people didn’t know. I just don’t really believe in it. I’m just, like, ‘Why can’t we just exist?’ I’ve been doing this for a long time, and I just didn’t talk about it. Whoops,” she added.“But I saw the article, and I was like, ‘Oh, I guess I came out today.’ OK, cool. It’s exciting to me because I guess people didn’t know, but it’s cool that they know,” she said.“I am for the girls,” she added.In the Variety article, Eilish talked to journalist Katcy Stephan about how she relates to other women.“I’ve never really felt like I could relate to girls very well,” she said. “I love them so much. I love them as people. I’m attracted to them as people. I’m attracted to them for real.”“I have deep connections with women in my life, the friends in my life, the family in my life,” added Eilish. “I’m physically attracted to them. But I’m also so intimidated by them and their beauty and their presence.”Despite her previous comments, on Sunday Eilish criticized Variety for its red carpet interview in a post on Instagram.“Thanks variety for my award and for also outing me on a red carpet at 11 am instead of talking about anything else that matters,” she wrote. “I like boys and girls leave me alone about it please literally who cares.”",1759,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/entertainment/billie-eilish-sexuality-scli-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204093511-billie-eilish-variety-120223.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,literally believe sunday felt sexual accidentally pop deal stephan beauty time confirm despite make angeles talk interview woman previous comment post katcy whoop exist friend love guess intimidate realize carpet add relates big excite physically event long reply billie criticize reveal award boy article connection publish red obvious star family matter variety girl interviewer leave cool instead journalist life deep kind grammy write attract eilish cover relate saturday recent november intend,0.98,0.1705514496873223,3.73736211031175,0.3872252747252747,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Cardi B makes runway debut for Balenciaga,2023-12-04 11:40:00,not specified,"Cardi B is known for bringing runway looks to the red carpet, but on Saturday she made a surprise appearance on the catwalk itself.Modeling a bold floor-length blue coat and sparkling diamond jewelry, the rapper made her fashion show debut for Balenciaga as the label shut down a stretch of Los Angeles’ South Windsor Boulevard for a star-studded presentation.“Yesterday was a dream!” she wrote on Instagram on Sunday, addressing the Spanish brand and its creative director Demna Gvasalia. “I had too much fun storming your runway!” Earlier on X, formerly Twitter, she posted a shot of herself walking the catwalk alongside the pun, “On my way to chic fil A!”Cardi B was joined on the tree-lined outdoor runway by models including Liu Wen and Mariacarla Boscono, marking the first time the brand has ever held a show in LA.The rapper, whose second studio album is expected next year, has a reputation for both elegant haute couture and over-the-top fashion statements — such as the vintage oyster-inspired Mugler dress she wore to the Grammys in 2019. Vogue magazine’s editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has previously praised the 31-year-old’s style, identifying her burgundy Thom Browne gown as a standout look at that year’s Met Gala.Priced at $7,950, the faux-fur off-the-shoulder coat she modeled on Saturday is part of Balenciaga’s new pre-fall 2023 collection. Elsewhere, wide-ranging looks spanned baggy, layered “neo-grunge” ensembles and structural evening gowns. The show signaled a marked move toward activewear — with shorts, bra tops and leggings among the latest offerings — while a “jersey section” took inspiration from 2000s-style velour tracksuits, the label said.In its promotional notes, Balenciaga wrote that the collection “illustrates Demna’s interpretation of LA’s fashion codes through a cinematic, character-driven lens.”“Ideas apply to everyday activities like jogging, yoga and gym sessions, and then progress to Hollywood evening with step-and-repeat-ready, Cristóbal Balenciaga-inspired gowns,” the notes added. “In between, sections of updated grunge, upscaled daywear and signature tailoring take the spotlight.”The glitzy show comes just a year after public backlash over two hugely controversial ad campaigns threatened to engulf the Spanish label. Last November, Demna apologized for campaign images featuring young children cuddling teddy bears dressed in bondage gear. The following month, social media users found that props used in a shoot for the label’s Spring 2023 collection included papers printed with the 2008 Supreme Court ruling on child pornography. The fashion house distanced itself from the images and announced that it was suing the production company behind the shoot, though the lawsuit was later dropped.Balenciaga collaborator Kim Kardashian condemned the ads at the time, saying she was “re-evaluating” her relationship with the brand. She was, however, in attendance at Saturday’s show, where she posed for photographs alongside half-sister Kendall Jenner.Given the location, it was no surprise to see plenty of Hollywood stars on the front row. Salma Hayek, Zooey Deschanel and Eva Longoria were among those to attend, as was Nicole Kidman, who was named a Balenciaga brand ambassador the same day.Danish actor and model Brigitte Nielsen, a mainstay of 1980s fashion, meanwhile marked her return to the runway in an all-black ensemble featuring a pair of thigh-high platform boots. “I’m 60, and starting modeling again — who would have thought?” she later told Vogue of her comeback, adding that she “had to get used to the seven-inch platforms for a second.”",3614,https://www.cnn.com/style/cardi-b-balenciaga-runway-debut/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204072936-01-balenciaga-cardi-b-120223.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,sunday blue formerly model liu pair activewear coat company social code boscono kendall runway jersey marked interpretation make actor expect angeles earlier signature fashion reputation vogue demna salma gown browne style image glitzy signal feature controversial magazine backlash mugler sparkle illustrates structural deschanel user dream prop grunge carpet boulevard stretch cardi paper gym upscaled session shut ambassador south return everyday activity twitter relationship hugely outdoor red jogging part shoot bra join nielsen layer found attendance surprise baggy pose dress tracksuits move previously praise follow told show balenciaga gear chic write gvasalia shot statement lawsuit debut yesterday platform plenty start bear supreme attend print grammys section nicole yoga catwalk alongside photograph announce spring time inspiration label kidman public x thom hollywood late engulf fun front storm standout threaten ruling windsor bring zooey post fil haute top address jewelry elegant mark creative vintage couture bondage condemn progress b studio add rapper album held collection collaborator wen diamond distance month promotional brigitte walk mariacarla comeback longoria mainstay burgundy production cuddle kardashian apologize spanish ensemble house location year apply court campaign child star eva boot bold wore director row wintour cinematic identify anna include short brand tailor idea cristóbal appearance note pornography young teddy update offering velour medium span daywear legging hayek saturday instagram november,0.98535,0.0830105146651909,11.177798165137611,0.3356972502805835,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Tom Hanks once ‘worked for Cher’ as a hotel bellman in the ’70s,2023-12-04 11:40:00,Marianne Garvey,"Tom Hanks had an interaction with Cher long before he became an Oscar-winning actor.Hanks appeared on “The Graham Norton Show” alongside Cher, Julia Roberts and Timothée Chalamet, where he talked about his time working at a hotel in the 1970s.“I have worked for Cher. I was a bellman at the Oakland Hilton Hotel,” he said, surprising Cher. “You were with one of your rock-and-roll husbands, and we had your bag. And then word came down, ‘Hey, run this up to Cher’s room,’ so I did. I knocked on the door and I put it down and you came out and said, ‘Yeah, that’s it. Thanks, kid.’ And that was it.”He calculated that the encounter happened in 1975 or 1976.Hanks admitted he’s a fan of the singer, telling her that “Mamma Mia! 2” was “motion picture perfection.”Chalamet added his own thoughts on Cher, shouting out her Oscar-winning performance in “Moonstruck,” while Roberts called out her work in “Silkwood.”“I think we should all go to the theater and watch Cher’s movies right now,” Hanks added.See the full clip from the “The Graham Norton Show” here.",1056,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/entertainment/tom-hanks-cher-graham-norton-show/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220406114659-marianne-garvey.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hey clip long alongside knock call surprising calculate time theater hilton husband picture talk hank interaction tom work oakland performance motion moonstruck full word mamma chalamet encounter robert bellman watch show bag room movie julia norton timothée singer admit add shout cher graham happen put run,0.5700000000000001,0.0,4.83564853556485,0.4704365079365079,0,2023-12-04
CNN,These Italian designers are using fruit peel to make furniture,2023-12-04 11:39:00,Arya Jyothi,"Imagine a world where nothing ends up in landfill. Instead, everything can be reused, recycled and repurposed, creating products that never reach their “end of life.”According to a recent report by the Circle Economy Foundation, only 7.2% of all used materials are being cycled back into the economy to be reused and recycled without creating waste.Milan-based company Krill Design aims to change this by creating furniture products made from a patented plastic-like biomaterial named Rekrill, which it says is fully organic, biodegradable, and can be used over and over again.The company was founded in 2018 by three architects, two of whom had already set up a 3D-printing company. Using fruit peel, orange seeds and coffee ground waste collected from businesses in Italy, Krill products can be redistributed to the same businesses for use in their offices, instead of furniture made from common plastics. Krill’s designs include bookends, stools, clocks, bowls, and a lamp named Ohmie.“After three or four years, you have to change your furniture [anyway],” says Marco Di Maio, director of operations at Krill. “But if all that furniture was made using our materials, we would be able to recover them, crush them and print other furniture with the same material. If, by mistake, any of our material ends up in the ocean, it is biodegradable and doesn’t produce any microplastics.”Each product is made through a four-step process. First, the food waste is dried and crushed into a very fine powder. Then, the powder is compounded with a biodegradable plastic alternative known as polyhydroxybutyrat (PHB), with the fruit waste making the PHB more rigid, according to Krill. The compound is then turned into a filament and, using a spool, put into a 3D printer. The Ohmie lamp takes around three hours to print, but printing times can vary depending on the product.“There’s a lot of companies that do design, and we wanted to be different,” says Di Maio.Krill has collaborated with a number of well-known brands, including drinks company Sanpellegrino and hotel chain Four Seasons, and has also participated in a Co.ffee Era project with the municipality of Milan, which aims to reduce coffee waste produced in three of the city’s neighborhoods. Through these projects, Krill has designed wine coolers, trays, drink holders and organizers, each in the colors corresponding to the food waste they were made from, with orange peel creating bright orange products, and coffee grounds creating rich dark brown products.Because a lot of food waste would otherwise be incinerated or dumped in landfill, by reusing fruit peel and coffee grounds, every kilogram of Rekrill corresponds to one kilogram of carbon dioxide offset from the production of plastic, according to Di Maio.He adds that Rekrill is as sturdy as wood, and won’t begin to degrade unless it’s touched by water, bacteria or acidity. And because it is made from organic materials, when Rekrill breaks down it is safe for fish to eat and can also be used in a home compost.But despite its eco-friendly benefits, Di Maio acknowledges that Rekrill is expensive. “Our material costs probably six times more than common plastic,” he says. “It is a very difficult and expensive process, so we understand why many companies aren’t doing it, but we took a risk, and we’ve been successful.”Di Maio is hopeful that in a few years, as more consumers and businesses are forced to face the damage unsustainable plastics are doing to the planet, Rekrill will be much more widely used.While bioplastics currently represent less than 1% of the 390 million tons of plastic produced annually, it is a rapidly growing segment with applications across different sectors, including food packaging, textiles and electronics. A number of other companies are innovating in this area, including UK-based Polymateria, which claims to have created the “world’s first self-destructing plastic,” which can be broken down into a wax-like substance that can fully biodegrade in soil.Joe Iles, circular design lead at environmental charity Ellen MacArthur Foundation, who isn’t involved with Krill, says that when it comes to claims of bioplastics being home compostable, it’s important to note that without the right conditions, materials could take years to break down. A 2022 UK study found that 60% of products labeled as compostable plastics do not fully break down in home compost.Iles adds that novel bioplastic materials may not be suitable for all local recycling systems.Despite these potential concerns, he says it’s important to encourage and commend businesses that are trying to create a more circular economy. “We need people to experiment and experimenting could mean getting it a bit wrong sometimes, but we’re getting it increasingly right,” Iles says.Krill is currently experimenting with other food waste including eggshells, tomatoes, and grape leftovers from winemaking, as well as looking to make its production process more efficient, less expensive and more eco-friendly.Ultimately, the company plans to sell the Rekrill filament, so that people and businesses can create products using their own 3D-printer. It’s also looking to develop injection molding — injecting the molten compound of food waste and PHB into a mold instead of 3D-printing — which could cut costs and save time.“We really believe this is the material of the future,” says Di Maio. “Little by little, a step at a time.”",5442,https://www.cnn.com/style/krill-italian-designers-fruit-peel-furniture-scn-spc/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231123153816-01-krill.jpg?c=original&q=h_618,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,believe mold report architect chain food dry cycle company imagine cut injection probably despite depend make kilogram turn maio touch wood save annually organizer number break substance patent back expensive mistake molten cooler bioplastics rich biodegrade dark compostable uk electronics bacteria million difficult represent rigid material circle set eggshell participate peel area reach fully damage biodegradable bioplastic macarthur holder circular hopeful force economy suitable bowl offset correspond carbon sector wine charity collect incinerate found ground degrade process lamp currently safe world potential develop dumped milan furniture rapidly leftover rekrill polyhydroxybutyrat important foundation innovate dioxide corresponds redistribute put print stool winemaking acidity iles packaging sanpellegrino cost fine filament sell krill produce plan bit drink italy spool condition office study time different benefit label create plastic business future inject concern collaborate color grow vary clock eat unsustainable home powder compound experiment environmental alternative orange step change hour phb consumer local bright recover crush printer municipality add involve planet wrong seed organic recycle encourage tray ocean landfill reduce grape common production city accord fish claim waste understand water year begin biomaterial coffee segment broken tomato neighborhood repurposed director acknowledges season design ohmie include risk product widely brand instead textile increasingly lead marco note printing project aim polymateria brown operation efficient fruit sturdy lot application commend reuse bookend recent,0.7455499999999999,0.0551267916207276,9.859688109161793,0.4331809293765813,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,"‘Black TV’ celebrates Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx and other trailblazers",2023-12-04 10:38:00,not specified,"One measure of race relations in the United States has been who was allowed to frequent the living rooms of White Americans. To be Black and on TV, and on a first-name basis with White viewers — Julia, J.J., Cliff, Olivia, Annalise and Dre, to name just a few over the last half-century — was to be trusted. In her book “Black TV: Five Decades of Groundbreaking Television From Soul Train to Black-ish and Beyond,” Washington Post pop culture writer Bethonie Butler is less interested in narrating how Black TV changed America (which it did) than in telling stories that “center Black people and their experiences, without tethering those experiences to the white people in their midst.”“Black TV” arrives during what might be seen as a victory lap for Black storytellers. When “Insecure” creator Issa Rae was interviewed on the red carpet before the 2017 Emmys and said she was “rooting for everybody Black,” she might have been conjuring the success of Shonda Rhimes (“Scandal”), Donald Glover (“Atlanta”), Quinta Brunson (“Abbott Elementary”) and Kenya Barris (“Black-ish”). The fact that many of those award winners found their voices as writers and showrunners speaks to the goals of “Black TV,” which is at its best when it highlights the creators and producers, as opposed to actors, who brought some semblance of Black life to television.Butler logically begins with “Julia,” which launched in 1968 with Diahann Carroll in the title role. Before “Julia” — a story about a widowed nurse and mother — series like “Amos ‘n’ Andy” and “Beulah” either leaned on stereotypes or depicted Black characters solely as servants. Hal Kanter worked on “Amos,” so creating “Julia” might have been an act of penance, but he was not convinced that the upscale Carroll would connect with viewers. And thus began the timeless dance that Butler continually recounts, of White producers and network executives serving as arbiters for what they believed to be authentic Blackness.While Carroll’s fame as an actress of stage and film helped her get the role, in other cases breakthroughs depended on the support of working Black actors, comedians and writers. One of the heroes of “Black TV” is comedian Redd Foxx. Butler shares the story of Foxx’s 1965 appearance on “The Tonight Show” when Johnny Carson asked about the best comic — presumably Black comic — on the scene. Foxx’s generous shout-out to Flip Wilson propelled Wilson to A-list status and a highly rated variety show. Wilson, in turn, used his show as a springboard for the premiere of Foxx’s “Sanford and Son” in 1972.Foxx hired “Black famous” writers Richard Pryor and Paul Mooney to work on “Sanford and Son” (though only two of the four episodes that the duo wrote made it to air) and advocated for “Chitlin’ Circuit” veterans like Slappy White and LaWanda Page as the unforgettable Aunt Esther. As Butler writes, Foxx threatened to quit “after producers suggested Page would need to be replaced because she lacked television experience.”Pryor translated his newly minted mainstream appeal into a seminal moment when he hosted “Saturday Night Live” during its first season. Based on Pryor’s star turn, NBC approached him to do a weekly variety show. “The Richard Pryor Show,” which premiered in 1977, lasted only four episodes, in large part because of Pryor’s battles with network executives, but it had a lasting impact. Mooney served as a writer and cast member, along with a handful of then-unknowns like Tim Reid (“WKRP in Cincinnati”), Marsha Warfield (“Night Court”) and John Witherspoon, who became everyone’s favorite Black father for the next two generations. Butler notes that “the through lines from The Richard Pryor Show to In Living Color to Def Comedy Jam to Chappelle’s Show are plentiful.”The roster of actors who appeared on sitcoms like “Sanford and Son,” “Good Times” and “The Jeffersons” — the trio of Norman Lear-produced sitcoms that forever changed how race was discussed on television — speaks to the ethical practices of Black Hollywood, though Hollywood did not always give Black creators that same level of respect. Butler recalls that “Good Times” co-creator Eric Monte sued producers Lear and Bud Yorkin for “stealing his ideas for Good Times, as well as the characters of George and Louise Jefferson, and What’s Happening!!, the 1976 sitcom based on Monte’s Cooley High.” He reportedly received a $1 million settlement and a portion of residuals from “Good Times.”With the success in recent years of “Scandal,” “How to Get Away With Murder” and “Empire,” it is easy to forget the early struggles of Black dramatic actors. No one could have predicted that an eight-night miniseries about generations of enslaved Africans in the United States would represent one of the greatest assemblages of Black actors ever. The cast of “Roots” (1977) included future Academy Award winners Louis Gossett Jr. and Cicely Tyson and Tony winner Ben Vereen. Indeed, Gossett and Olivia Cole won Emmys for their supporting roles. Yet, as Butler notes, “Roots” “did not change the hiring landscape for Black actors as many had expected.”The success of “Roots” came as the popularity of the “Black sitcom” started to wane. The game changer was “The Cosby Show” in 1984. At the time Black characters had become tokens or, worse, fish-out-of-water types on series like “Gimme a Break,” “Facts of Life” and “Diff’rent Strokes.” In the wake of “The Cosby Show,” “Jeffersons” veterans Sherman Hemsley and Marla Gibbs were given second acts on “Amen” and “227,” respectively. Black family life sitcoms followed, including “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” and “Family Matters” (which ran an astounding 215 episodes), as well as shows launched on fledgling networks Fox, the WB and UPN, such as “Moesha” and “Living Single.”The powerful message throughout “Black TV” is that the figures with the biggest impact played a long game.

Reuters,"US officials to visit Taiwan to explain chip curbs, minister says",2023-12-04 09:43:00,not specified,"TAIPEI, Dec 4 (Reuters) - U.S. officials plan to visit Taiwan to explain to companies details of new curbs, primarily aimed at China, on advanced chip exports, the island's economy minister said on Monday.The Biden administration in October said it plans to halt shipments to China of more advanced artificial intelligence chips designed by Nvidia and others, as part of measures to try to stop Beijing from receiving U.S. technologies to strengthen its military.Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW), and many other semiconductor firms, has its own restrictions on what can go to China, which claims the democratically-governed island as its own territory.Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said some details of the extremely long new U.S. rules needed explanation.""We think that them (the U.S.) coming to Taiwan, to explain things to companies, getting a face-to-face understanding of the thinking of U.S. enforcement agencies, having on site communication on the details, is something Taiwan needs,"" she told reporters.Given the concentration of chip making in Taiwan it was ""advantageous"" for Taiwanese companies to hear the details of the new controls from the U.S. officials, Wang said.",1226,https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-officials-visit-taiwan-explain-chip-curbs-minister-says-2023-12-04/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/OJAV2HV5H5L7DIYP72EUVWTLHU.jpg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,economy measure tsmc control large taiwan communication site wang stop export company shipment design contract chipmaker artificial nvidia advantageous visit plan halt hear long taipei detail advanced minister restriction reuters explain taiwanese biden firm dec aim october home enforcement make administration official receive curb world rule semiconductor china intelligence extremely explanation told chip beijing island agency part concentration understand strengthen claim primarily technology,0.71805,0.0,12.06073394495413,0.6029720279720279,0,2023-12-04
NPR,Spotify to cut 17% of staff in the latest round of tech layoffs,2023-12-04 08:59:00,Emily Olson,"The music streaming giant Spotify has announced it's cutting 17% of its workforce in a dramatic move aimed at slashing costs. In a memo addressed to staff, CEO Daniel Ek said it was critical that the company ""rightsize"" its financial situation after hiring too many people in 2020 and 2021, when capital was cheaper. ""The Spotify of tomorrow must be defined by being relentlessly resourceful in the ways we operate, innovate, and tackle problems,"" Ek wrote. ""This kind of resourcefulness transcends the basic definition — it's about preparing for our next phase, where being lean is not just an option but a necessity."" The round of cuts — the third this year — equates to about 1,500 jobs, according to a CNBC source that said the Swedish company currently employs about 9,000 people across more than 40 global office locations. Across the tech industry, tens of thousands of positions have been cut in the last year as a pandemic-era boon continues to fade. According to the tech job tracker layoffs.fyi, more than 250,000 tech workers have been laid off since the start of the year. Still, the size of the Spotify cuts may feel ""surprisingly large"" for the moment, Ek wrote. The company posted $34 million in operating income during its third-quarter earnings call, its first quarterly profit since 2021. Lower personnel costs, driven by two smaller rounds of cuts, was one of the cost-saving factors. The company cut 6% of its workforce, about 600 employees, in January. It laid off another 2% of staff, roughly 200 roles, in June. At the same time, Spotify has raised prices on its subscription plans and has launched new expansions in audiobooks and podcasts. It set a goal to reach a billion users by 2023, and currently has over 570 million of them. That's a little less than double the number of listeners the platform attracted in 2020. As of 8:30 a.m., the company's shares were up about 5% in premarket trading. Departing employees will be offered approximately five months of severance pay plus healthcare coverage, vacation pay, immigration support and two months' worth of career-search assistance, according to Ek's statement.",2142,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216950219/spotify-layoffs-17-percent-tech,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/01/23/ap22230562450138_sq-94d48afe1e2ef7c7ce0873be9e57008455387934-s100-c15.jpg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,employ lean large healthcare spotify innovate profit round cost severance number coverage ceo quarterly global operate feel june goal statement tracker approximately swedish location share operating thousand ten aim write call equates expansion pay moment subscription relentlessly continue staff raise double worth daniel year platform income assistance option offer immigration move fade reach kind situation cnbc stream roughly transcends cut industry announce phase small worker low role company music boon driven critical currently hire trading job depart basic plan address support price giant rightsize set vacation january dramatic definition billion cheaper source million position month workforce start office laid podcasts earnings listener tech slash problem surprisingly time financial resourcefulness define tomorrow necessity launch audiobooks prepare personnel factor employee premarket resourceful user size accord tackle attract memo capital post,0.69225,0.1400560224089636,8.218277511961723,0.3965442603373638,0,2023-12-04
ABC,Spanish newspaper group files multimillion-euro suit against Meta over ad practices,2023-12-04 08:33:00,CIARÁN GILES Associated Press,"MADRID -- A Spanish association representing more than 80 newspapers has filed a lawsuit against Facebook parent Meta accusing it of unfair competition in online advertising by allegedly ignoring European Union rules on data protection.In a statement, the Information Media Association said it is demanding 550 million euros ($600 million) from the social media giant. The association represents dozens of newspapers including Spain’s principal dailies El País, El Mundo, ABC and La Vanguardia.The association accuses Meta of “systematic and massive non-compliance” with EU data protection regulations between May 2018, when they took force, and July 2023.It said Meta has repeatedly ignored the requirement that citizens give their consent to the use of their data for advertising profiling.The company declined to comment, saying it hadn't seen the legal papers.Meta’s Facebook and Instagram platforms have long used behavioral advertising to make money. The practice involves tracking individual online behavior such as web browsing habits, mouse clicks and app usage, then using that data to build profiles for targeting ads to users.But court rulings have eroded Meta's ability to justify its methods under the EU's data privacy regulations. In July, the EU's top court ruled the company can't force users in the 27-nation bloc to agree to personalized ads, saying users need to freely give their consent. Meta responded by offering ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram for European users for a monthly fee.The Spanish association said the use of personal data of users of Meta platforms, tracked without their consent, allowed the U.S. company to offer advertising space based on an “illegitimately obtained competitive advantage,” indirectly threatening the livelihood of Spanish media.It called on advertisers in the public and private sectors “to entrust their advertising campaigns to safe, reliable and responsible media, respectful of the rights of citizens and committed to promoting democratic quality in Spain.”“The time has come to put an end to the behavior of technology companies that can afford to pay million-dollar penalties to continue failing to comply with regulations, destroying the market in which we operate and making the illegitimately obtained income their own,” said Irene Lanzaco, director general of the association.The case was filed at Madrid's mercantile courts.___",2409,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/spanish-newspaper-association-files-multimillion-euro-suit-meta-105354760,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/0d6d4407-513e-40f8-b234-4a2081431986/wirestory_515bccf08cbcbf045be82144a42f7bee_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,responsible competition newspaper base lanzaco medium spain social quality lawsuit involves indirectly destroy advantage method target accuse freely campaign requirement behavior privacy offering operate statement public comment tracked consent browsing director allegedly citizen monthly put systematic obtain ability instagram demand repeatedly spanish top money mercantile individual protection ignore court july bloc facebook call app make pay madrid continue meta rule platform income regulation offer euro dozen association represent private behavioral union commit illegitimately technology usage personalize version case force advertising ruling profile sector data build safe país give space company online mundo european personal threaten livelihood massive long information giant respectful practice entrust million click afford web respond parent habit agree irene comply abc mouse advertiser market general time reliable principal decline competitive erode include justify unfair promote penalty legal accuses user fail daily track file democratic,0.20315,0.12453300124533,13.583012345679013,0.4022435897435897,0,2023-12-04

A genetics expert reveals the fascinating truth,2023-12-04 07:54:00,Erica Lamberg,"""The eyes are the window to the soul,"" notes a timeless quote.And while your eyes also bring the world your way, the origins of eye color are fascinating and even mysterious.To help lay out the details of this genetic marvel, Fox News Digital spoke to a genetics expert about the topic.Eye color refers to the color of your iris, which is the colored part of your eye that surrounds the pupil.KIDS' SLEEP PROBLEMS COULD BE INHERITED, NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTSYour pupil is the small black opening in the center, per the Cleveland Clinic.""Your eye color is like your fingerprint. Nobody else in the world has the exact same eye color as you do."" (iStock)""Your eye color is like your fingerprint. Nobody else in the world has the exact same eye color as you do,"" the Cleveland Clinic noted.Eye color depends on the amount, type and distribution of melanin, or pigment, in the iris of the eye, said Blair Stevens, a clinical genetic counselor and the director of prenatal genetic counseling services and an associate professor at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, to Fox News Digital.""Melanin production is determined by someone’s genetic information, which we inherit from our parents,"" Stevens said.BE WELL: TREAT AND PREVENT DRY EYE SYNDROME FROM EXTENDED SCREEN USEEye color is considered a ""polygenic"" trait, meaning several genes are involved.To that end, some genetic variants produce more melanin, which leads to a darker color, while other genetic variants produce less melanin, which leads to lighter colored eyes, Stevens said.Melanin production continues to develop after birth.""People often wonder why newborns’ eye color changes and that is because melanin production continues to develop after birth,"" she added.""Recessive"" traits are typically only expressed if someone inherits the recessive gene from both parents, Stevens said, whereas a ""dominant"" trait inherited from only one parent can mask a recessive trait from the other parent.""Brown eye color is thought to be dominant to blue eye color, similar to the mixing of paint."" (iStock)""Brown eye color is thought to be dominant to blue eye color, similar to the mixing of paint,"" she said.For example, if you have blue paint and mix in brown — the resulting color will appear more brown than blue.Although brown eye color is thought to be dominant to blue, Stevens emphasized that we have two copies of each gene — one from each parent — and multiple genes are involved in determining eye color.BE WELL: GET REGULAR EYE EXAMS TO PROTECT VISION AND CATCH WARNING SIGNS EARLY""This means there are many combinations of genes that children can inherit from their parents,"" she explained.""Imagine a water color palette that has some blue, green and brown paint options.""Eye color, hair color and skin color are all affected by melanin, or pigment, that our bodies produce, Stevens told Fox News Digital.""Our genes dictate the type, structure and amount of melanin,"" she said.Yes, siblings within families can have different eye colors, said one expert.

Washington Post,Do you have ‘rizz’? Oxford picks its word of the year from Gen Z slang.,2023-12-04 07:10:00,Annabelle Timsit,"Many of us got our groove back in 2023. After two long years of pandemic-induced isolation and disruption, we left the house. We went on dates. And — according to Oxford’s Word of the Year — we got rizz.“Rizz” is a slang term that refers to someone’s “ability to attract a romantic or sexual partner,” according to Oxford Languages, an arm of Oxford University Press, which picks the Word of the Year. It was selected by experts and a popular vote from a list of eight terms chosen to reflect humanity’s array of moods, interests and concerns this year — beating words like “Swiftie,” “beige flag” and “situationship” for the top slot. (Full definitions for those words below.)The victory for “rizz” — which Oxford said is believed to be short for “charisma” — could be because a word that encompasses swagger, game and style reflects people’s more “positive” outlook in 2023, Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, said in a phone interview. “That pandemic exhaustion is starting to give way to all the feelings that come after that,” he said.Whereas the 2022 Word of the Year — “goblin mode,” which Oxford defined as a “type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations” — was about keeping people away; “rizz” is more “about how you attract people,” Grathwohl said.The word “rizz” is believed to have emerged in 2022 out of online gaming communities, according to Oxford University Press. But it truly took off this year after actor Tom Holland used it in an interview with BuzzFeed to describe his alleged lack of romantic skill. “I have no rizz whatsoever. I have limited rizz,” Holland said in the June interview, a clip of which has since been viewed over 58 million times on X, formerly Twitter.The comment caused some eyebrow-raising among social media users, many of whom questioned the actor, who is in a relationship with actress and singer Zendaya. “Bro really said ‘i have limited rizz’ when he’s with zendaya,” joked one user.In the interview, Holland added, “I’m locked up. So I’m happy and in love. So I’ve got no need for rizz.”The word spread on social media and soon became mainstream, particularly among young people, according to Oxford University Press. It spawned puns — “irrizzistable” — and spinoff terms; people who prioritized style over substance in a romantic or sexual partner became known as wearing “rizz-colored glasses.” It even made its way into companies’ marketing lingo, such as dating app Tinder’s “rizz-first redesign.”“Rizz” was added to Oxford Languages’ eight-word shortlist for 2023 Word of the Year because of its popularity and origins in internet culture, according to a news release. These words were drawn from Oxford’s vast language corpus — a collection of large bodies of tagged, electronic text — that is regularly updated with new English words drawn from around the world. This year, the list included terms relating to pop culture, like “Swiftie,” the moniker for fans of Taylor Swift, and words relating to artificial intelligence and the climate.The eight words were paired in head-to-head matchups — “rizz” was up against “beige flag” — and the public was asked to choose its favorite word for each matchup. Language experts then analyzed usage data and “public commentary” to pick the winner. More than 30,000 people voted in the poll between Nov. 27 and 30, the organizers said.Last year was the first time the group held a public vote for Word of the Year, and the winner — “goblin mode” — was chosen entirely based on the results of that vote, it said at the time.The choice of “rizz” illustrates the growing influence of younger generations, particularly Gen Z, typically referring to people born between 1997 and 2012, on popular language, according to Oxford University Press. “From activism to dating and wider culture, as Gen Z comes to have more impact on society, differences in perspectives and lifestyle play out in language, too,” it said in its news release.Grathwohl said he wasn’t surprised when “rizz” beat out the competition. The word is “short, snappy, sparkly” and fun to pronounce because of its rolled Z, he said. It feels “playful” at a time when people want to “take a break” from sometimes-grim news cycles and “reflect on the year in a way that doesn’t feel heavy or burdensome,” he said.While “rizz” is a new word, the feelings it captures — those of attraction — are as old as time. They have been similarly expressed over the years by other words, such as “game,” which Oxford said was first popularized in the 1970s. This shows that while language might evolve, parts of human culture stay the same, Grathwohl said.“The pursuit of ‘rizz’ is an eternal one,” he said.",4766,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2023/12/04/rizz-meaning-oxford-word-of-year/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,clip competition isolation base concern lingo large medium social happy swiftie body zendaya arm entirely feel pop wider public comment influence marketing x human english illustrates ability origin held buzzfeed slovenly top heavy groove actress grow impact back analyze make slot mood unapologetically lack charisma sparkly whatsoever positive lazy organizer usage popular left casper give evolve cycle company difference relate prioritize popularity tom date young long express situationship swagger definition million singer start wear president grathwohl shortlist formerly capture born matchup disruption time tinder news world intelligence beating attraction mainstream lifestyle community greedy part vote skill eternal accord regularly expert spawn user rizz fun irrizzistable question word spread reject moniker burdensome allege spinoff array break similarly favorite gen release artificial stay full pronounce group expectation june romantic away refer view exhaustion behaviour sexual result believe vast society app language activism pair term internet text phone year partner roll substance interview drawn beige pursuit joked goblin playful collection add love chosen culture feeling slang data winner select describe corpus reflect press surprised flag encompasses typically limited online electronic particularly style poll norm tag pick swift short play list show pandemic popularize commentary outlook type generation perspective game holland actor choose victory define choice university house beat include lock humanity snappy emerge attract relationship update taylor oxford refers interest,0.99185,0.0629458665547629,7.049939393939393,0.4095500653192959,0,2023-12-04
NPR,Opening arguments begin in Jonathan Majors trial,2023-12-04 07:00:00,Neda Ulaby,"The trial has been delayed for months. On Thursday, a jury of three men and three women were selected, with two alternates. Majors, whose Hollywood stardom has dimmed since the incident in March, has been appearing in the Manhattan courtroom since the trial began, with a Bible in hand. His current girlfriend, actress Meagan Goode, has appeared with him. Jonathan Majors arrives at court for a jury selection on his domestic violence case, on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023, in New York. Yuki Iwamura/AP hide caption Jonathan Majors arrives at court for a jury selection on his domestic violence case, on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023, in New York. Majors' lawyer, Priya Chaudhury, has worked to discredit Majors' accuser, calling Jabbari ""a liar"" and asserting that in fact, she was the abuser. After Majors filed a cross complaint in June, Jabbari was arrested in October. The Manhattan district attorney's office ultimately declined to pursue the charges, saying the case lacked ""prosecutorial merit."" Judge Michael Gaffey announced on Thursday that the defense will be allowed to bring up Jabbari's arrest during the trial. It's a minor victory for Majors' team, as was the judge's decision to keep certain evidence in the case under seal. The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, will include testimony from Jabbari â€” and potentially other women with whom Majors has been involved, according to court filings. Majors had been one of Hollywood's most promising young leading men, earning comparisons to Denzel Washington. He had recently been cast as a wily supervillain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the studio had been slowly building up his character, Kang the Conqueror with appearances in the 2023 movie Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and season two of the Disney+ show Loki. Majors was arrested on March 25, 2023 when NYPD officers responded to a call and found Jabbari with cuts, bruises and a broken finger. She was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital. Majors has since suggested Jabbari attacked him because she was furious over texts he was receiving from another woman. He remains under a protective order to avoid contact with her. The fallout for the actor has been severe: He has been dropped by his management and publicist. He is no longer appearing in several high-profile ad campaigns, and a much buzzed-about film in which he stars, Magazine Dreams, has been removed from Disney's schedule for theatrical release. ""Jonathan Majors, the real victim in this shameful ordeal, has had his life, career, and reputation torn apart. Yet he remains unwavering in his determination to be absolved from this harrowing ordeal,"" the actor's lawyer wrote in a statement last August. Majors has pleaded not guilty.

Washington Post,Ousted propaganda scholar Joan Donovan accuses Harvard of bowing to Meta,2023-12-04 06:01:00,Joseph Menn,"A prominent disinformation scholar has accused Harvard University of dismissing her to curry favor with Facebook and its current and former executives in violation of her right to free speech.Joan Donovan claimed in a filing with the Education Department and the Massachusetts attorney general that her superiors soured on her as Harvard was getting a record $500 million pledge from Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg’s charitable arm.As research director of Harvard Kennedy School projects delving into mis- and disinformation on social media platforms, Donovan had raised millions in grants, testified before Congress and been a frequent commentator on television, often faulting internet companies for profiting from the spread of divisive falsehoods.Last year, the school’s dean told her that he was winding down her main project and that she should stop fundraising for it. This year, the school eliminated her position. The surprise dismissal alarmed fellow researchers elsewhere, who saw Donovan as a pioneer in an increasingly critical area of great sensitivity to the powerful and well-connected tech giants.Donovan has remained silent about what happened until now, filing a 248-page legal statement obtained by The Washington Post that traces her problems to her acquisition of a trove of explosive documents known as the Facebook Papers and championing their importance before an audience of Harvard donors that included Facebook’s former top communications executive.Harvard disputes Donovan’s core claims, telling The Post that she was a staff employee and that it had not been able to find a faculty sponsor to oversee her work, as university policy requires. It also denies that she was fired, saying she “was offered the chance to continue as a part-time adjunct lecturer, and she chose not to do so.”Donovan obtained the Facebook documents when they and the former Facebook employee who leaked them, Frances Haugen, were the subject of extensive news coverage in October 2021, with The Post writing that the documents showed Facebook “privately and meticulously tracked real-world harms exacerbated by its platforms, ignored warnings from its employees about the risks of their design decisions and exposed vulnerable communities around the world to a cocktail of dangerous content.”As the main attraction at a Zoom meeting for top Kennedy School donors on Oct. 29 that year, Donovan said the papers showed that Meta knew the harms it was causing. Former top Facebook communications executive Elliot Schrage asked repeated questions during the meeting and said she badly misunderstood the papers, Donovan wrote in a sworn declaration included in the filing.Ten days after the donors meeting, Kennedy School dean Doug Elmendorf, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, emailed Donovan with pointed questions about her research goals and methods, launching an increase in oversight that restricted her activities and led to her dismissal before the end of her contract, according to the declaration. Donovan wrote that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s $500 million gift for a new artificial intelligence institute at the university, announced Dec. 7 that year, had been in the works before the donor meeting.Leaders at the Kennedy School “were inappropriately influenced by Meta/Facebook,” Donovan claims in her declaration. “A significant conflict of interest arising from funding and personal relationships has created a pervasive culture at HKS of operating in the best interest of Facebook/Meta at the expense of academic freedom and Harvard’s own stated mission.”The filing raises questions about the potential conflict of interest created by Big Tech’s influence at research institutions that are called upon for their expertise on the industry.“The document’s allegations of unfair treatment and donor interference are false. The narrative is full of inaccuracies and baseless insinuations, particularly the suggestion that Harvard Kennedy School allowed Facebook to dictate its approach to research,” Kennedy School spokesperson Sofiya Cabalquinto said by email. “By policy and in practice, donors have no influence over this or other work.”Cabalquinto’s email added: “By long-standing policy to uphold academic standards, all research projects at Harvard Kennedy School need to be led by faculty members. Joan Donovan was hired as a staff member (not a faculty member) to manage a media manipulation project. When the original faculty leader of the project left Harvard, the School tried for some time to identify another faculty member who had time and interest to lead the project. After that effort did not succeed, the project was given more than a year to wind down. Joan Donovan was not fired, and most members of the research team chose to remain at the School in new roles.”Elmendorf declined to comment.At one point, Elmendorf told Donovan that she did not have academic freedom because she was staff rather than faculty, she recounts. Officials confirmed that position to The Post.But Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig said that stance should be limited to traditional staff work, not research papers, other publications and teaching.“When you’re doing what looks like academic work as one of the most prominent people in an academic field, the university ought to award that person the protections of academic freedom,” said Lessig, an expert on corruption who made inquiries to Harvard’s administration on Donovan’s behalf. “When she was presenting herself to the world, there was no asterisk at the bottom of her name saying, ‘As long as what she says is consistent with the interests of Harvard University.’”Donovan was recently hired for a tenure-track professorship at Boston University.The Donovan case comes at a time when researchers who focus on social media platforms find themselves under increasing attack. Trump adviser Stephen Miller’s legal foundation has sued academic and independent researchers, claiming that they conspired with government agencies to suppress speech, and Republican-led congressional committees have subpoenaed their records, adding to the pressure.In addition, Big Tech companies themselves have sponsored research, made grants to some colleges and universities, and doled out data to professors who agree to specific avenues of inquiry.The filing asks the federal Education Department’s civil rights division to investigate whether Harvard violated Donovan’s right to free speech and academic freedom. It asks Massachusetts’s charity regulators to examine whether the university deceived donors or misappropriated their funds by retaining millions that Donovan had raised for her research.A copy sent to Harvard’s new president, Claudine Gay, asks her to determine whether the Kennedy School had breached the university’s own policies.“All of the efforts taken to undermine Dr. Donovan came at great costs — to the donors who contributed millions of dollars to her work, and to the public more broadly who every day, all day long, are exposed to disinformation and misinformation,” Whistleblower Aid attorneys Andrew Bakaj and Kyle Gardiner wrote in the filing.“There are a handful of tried and true means to coerce someone or some entity to do something they would not otherwise do, and influence through financial compensation is at or near the top of the list,” the filing says. “Objectively, $500 million is certainly significant financial influence.”In addition to Donovan, Whistleblower Aid has represented Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower; former Twitter security chief Peiter Zatko; and anonymous whistleblowers from the intelligence community.In the documents, Donovan contends that Meta’s influence at Harvard goes beyond money and includes deep personal connections. Schrage, for one, earned degrees from Harvard College, the Kennedy School and Harvard’s law school.Zuckerberg and Facebook’s former longtime chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, were Harvard undergraduates, as was Zuckerberg’s wife, Priscilla Chan.Elmendorf served as Sandberg’s adviser for a club she started in college. They remained close, and Elmendorf attended Sandberg’s wedding in August 2022. Four days later, he told Donovan he was winding down her research team, she says in the complaint.Kennedy School officials said Elmendorf and Sandberg never discussed Donovan. Schrage and Sandberg declined to comment.Meta also declined to comment, while the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative said it contributed money because it cared about the science. “CZI had no involvement in Dr. Donovan’s departure from Harvard,” spokesperson Jeff MacGregor said.Donovan says in her complaint that Elmendorf emailed her after the October donors’ meeting and asked to discuss her Facebook work and “focus on a few key issues drawn from the questions raised by the Dean’s Council and my own limited reading of current events.”He wrote that he wanted to hear from her about “How you define the problem of misinformation for both analysis and possible responses (algorithm-adjusting or policymaking) when there is no independent arbiter of truth (in this country or others) and constitutional protections of speech (in some countries)?”Donovan said in the filing that Elmendorf’s use of the phrase “arbiters of truth” alarmed her because Facebook uses the same words to explain its reluctance to take actions against false content.She explained to Elmendorf that rather than making moral judgments about politics or proclaiming that a vaccine is good or bad, she looked for provable manipulation of platforms, as with fake accounts.“We do not generally speak about what is good or bad for a society, but rather what is true or false about a specific public event,” she emailed him.Donovan then alerted colleagues with whom she was starting to work on the Facebook Archive of leaked documents that she was drawing heat. Both suggested that they take the name of Donovan’s Technology and Social Change Research Project off the archive project’s website.“Let’s remove the explicit listing of TASC, minimally, or of all three groups, when the website updates later today,” Kennedy School professor Latanya Sweeney wrote in an email included in Donovan’s filing. “No reason to put a target on the project that allows FB to claim bias before we even do anything.”Donovan’s project remained listed on the page until this year, according to copies preserved by the internet archive.Sweeney said her role was twisted by the Donovan filing. “The number and nature of inaccuracies and falsehoods in the document are so abundant and self-serving as to be horribly disappointing,” she told The Post. “Meta exerted no influence over the Facebook Archive or any of our/my work.”Elmendorf met with Donovan again in August 2022 and told her that her project at the Kennedy School would end in the coming year, the filing says.Though Donovan’s contract was supposed to keep her on the job through the end of 2024, her superiors took away her ability to start new projects, raise money or organize large events, she alleges. They kept the money she had brought in, including more than $1 million from Craigslist founder Craig Newmark that he wanted specifically to go to her research project, according to documents quoted in the declaration. Newmark declined to comment.The Kennedy School said no money was misused. The Massachusetts attorney general’s office said it is reviewing the filing. The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.This September, Elmendorf said that the current academic year would be his last as dean and that he would continue to teach.The Facebook Archive finally went public in October. Far down a page devoted to the history of the site, it says that Sweeney’s Public Interest Tech Lab “received an anonymous drop of the internal Facebook documents” and that “Dr. Joan Donovan immediately recognized the valuable insight the documents provided.”",11937,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/04/joan-donovan-harvard-dismissal-complaint/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,washington pervasive doug professorship knew oversight sponsor restrict television explosive listing dr council bottom handful doled gay abundant adviser fellow claimed meeting change goal statement public comment director finally zoom put obtain ability manage alert false top standard sweeney charity elliot october call misappropriate spokesperson leader official focus subpoenaed foundation approach brought generally arise congressional key misuse grant warning suppress fundraise analysis trump twist undergraduate country interference close announce give funding reluctance role company trace contract cabalquinto stance reason connection newmark recognize long exert czi avenue congress million nature superior government today remain president present happen corruption mark retain insight champion miller problem whistleblower financial news sofiya federal intelligence work powerful asks attraction community surprise leak repeat agency charitable falsehood committee accord free speech reading increasingly copy preserve education politics stop college audience phrase design divisive artificial field coverage method inquiry accuse full recently peiter zuckerberg massachusetts fault constitutional group consistent quote uphold craigslist away behalf acquisition dismiss deceive badly security exacerbate breach fake division ignore fund claudine manipulation sensitivity write society review response degree baseless receive suggest internet elmendorf year latanya activity tasc represent bias gardiner provable importance page case discus compensation donor culture require attend longtime freedom proclaim limited job entity personal particularly prominent original cocktail organize zatko policy expose publication great disappoint scholar website september practice position list science speak traditional independent judgment draw lawrence dangerous define launch inaccuracy recount include craig insinuation legal former claim inappropriately relationship update suggestion confirm minimally request large medium earn budget social action vulnerable suppose big cost number initiative target privately examine lessig august complaint research subject tracked email influence explain potential money chose objectively current sour silent make event extensive kyle lead deep staff platform pioneer member aid priscilla law coerce truth founder broadly officer technology fire dictate heat pledge left policymaking colleague communication treatment investigate joan dismissal hire harm institution undermine haugen point dollar denies violate contribute dispute misunderstood stephen school day kennedy person record testify possible start drop office fb oversee specifically dean delve chan agree departure general administration time provide violation lab world arbiter increase attack unfair asterisk civil sworn conspire donovan wedding expert contends post hks commentator question spread word issue site executive profit regulator curry state project specific jeff department disinformation expertise allegation bakaj institute andrew expense sandberg club filing determine history operating protection facebook chief involvement alleges continue frequent raise meta narrative offer wife identify conflict drawn team area add meticulously trove sheryl data significant document wind immediately archive critical adjunct horribly chance decision hear faculty schrage boston risk devote declaration award researcher create favor show harvard respond find france tech explicit succeed valuable twitter misinformation decline university internal eliminate effort lecturer anonymous told professor employee remove serve academic core macgregor addition alarmed paper vaccine gift discuss attorney interest,0.762,0.1507916561950238,12.016365366317793,0.4140896714801826,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Can taking vitamin B12 boost energy? Here’s what the science says.,2023-12-04 06:00:00,"Trisha Pasricha, MD","Q: I’m tired often and heard that vitamin B12 can help with fatigue and boost energy levels. Should I be taking a supplement?A: There’s no proven benefit to taking vitamin B12 for fatigue unless you have a deficiency that causes anemia. Start by asking your doctor for a simple set of blood tests for vitamin B12 and related biomarkers. Adults above age 65 and vegans are particularly at risk of a deficiency.If you’re deficient in the vitamin, you should take a supplement.For everyone else looking for an energy boost, my advice as a rule of thumb in medicine is, where possible, less is more. Don’t take a supplement without a proven benefit. Instead, talk to your physician about other ways to help with energy levels, including making lifestyle changes or getting tested to rule out potential medical issues such as thyroid disease.Vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin that serves several important biological functions, including in metabolism and producing healthy blood cells. Here are the areas where we know supplementation can be beneficial:Other areas that many people look to B12 as a tonic — including muscle aches, arthritis, insomnia or generalized weakness (in the absence of anemia) — have little to no evidence behind them.The most frequent symptom of low B12 is a vague one: exhaustion. Cognitive changes, irritability and even paranoia have also been linked to cases of vitamin B12 deficiency. So has tongue swelling.Certain groups are at higher risk of being deficient and should talk to their doctor about getting screened:Vitamin B12 is naturally present in animal-based proteins, including meat, fish, eggs and dairy. (Fun fact: It’s especially high in clams or beef liver.)If you’re on a fully plant-based diet, you might still get an adequate amount of vitamin B12 from fortified foods, although not always. Some cereals and many brands of nondairy milk, for example Oatly or Silk soy milk, are fortified with B12. Nutritional yeast, a seasoning used in vegan recipes for its cheesy flavor, often is too.The recommended intake for vitamin B12 in adults is 2.4 mcg. Here’s how much vitamin B12 is found in some common foods:Some people prefer a vitamin B12 shot, which is typically given in the arm intramuscularly often at your health-care provider’s office or pharmacy. If you have a severe deficiency, doctors may recommend starting with the shot, but in general, high-dose oral vitamin B12 replenishes your system just as well as the shots.Many of my patients wonder what’s the harm in just taking a supplement and seeing what happens. Even high doses — over-the-counter pills typically contain 1,000 mcg — are generally considered safe, because our bodies absorb only a fraction of that. But a study published in 2020 in JAMA Network Open found that higher levels of vitamin B12 in the blood were associated with increased risk of death from all causes. Other studies have found a link between high levels of the vitamin and cardiovascular disease and increased risk of hip fracture.",3013,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/12/04/vitamin-b12-supplements-energy-fatigue/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,meat death tonic fun issue paranoia hip proven boost thumb diet body fully provider blood heard instead associate arm group adequate recipe change thyroid nutritional study tire oatly simple fish milk potential especially yeast vegan common evidence exhaustion metabolism naturally consider replenishes insomnia make clam frequent serf rule cardiovascular benefit publish muscle cheesy generally produce protein severe deficiency adult oral shot amount wonder absence high liver biological cell energy fraction area patient case cereal supplement deficient healthy safe vague give doctor open related brand low fracture advice anemia typically irritability egg dairy harm biomarkers particularly weakness link symptom beneficial risk set nondairy vitamin system network fact ache possible tongue start screen office medical season present cognitive beef mcg fortify essential medicine intake jama silk disease fatigue general function flavor age prefer arthritis test talk contain include important generalize food recommend level increase lifestyle physician intramuscularly pill absorb found supplementation pharmacy,0.45725,0.0,9.217162872154113,0.4706484295845998,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,"Modern meeting etiquette: Wear pants, beware of tech lag, chat sparingly",2023-12-04 06:00:00,Danielle Abril,"Eating in your kitchen on Zoom? Mumbling jokes in the conference room during a hybrid video call? In this new phase of hybrid work, the rules of acceptable meeting behavior can be tricky.For years, most office workers held their meetings in person, with the occasional phone conference call to include people working elsewhere. But all that changed during the pandemic, when most meetings went entirely virtual using video conferencing tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams.Now, our bad pandemic habits may be conveying messages we don’t mean to send.“We all did a lot of video calling, and that breeds contentment,” said Liz Wyse, author of the “Hybrid Working Guide” at Debrett’s, a British professional coaching company that specializes in etiquette. “Everyone’s standards have slipped.”So what are the modern expectations for meetings?We spoke to some etiquette experts to get the best tips for meetings in this new environment.Virtual meetings changed the way we think about dressing for meetings — in some cases it meant business on top and pajamas on bottom. But experts say no matter how enticing it may be for men to participate without pants, they shouldn’t do it.“You never know when you’re going to have to pop up [out of your seat],” said Diane Gottsman, the San Antonio-based owner of the professional etiquette training company the Protocol School of Texas. “We have to anticipate that something is going to happen even if it probably won’t.”Consider your overall appearance, said Julia Esteve Boyd, a Switzerland-based etiquette consultant. Your dress code may be a little more informal if you’re on a video call with colleagues, but with clients or executives, you may want to dress up.“You have to have the same level of formality that you would if it was a face-to-face meeting,” she said.In hybrid environments, there are often more distractions. Whether it is your roommate talking to you or email pings and side notifications, the chances of being interrupted are plentiful.It may be helpful to switch off your notifications and keep your eyes steady on the screen for important meetings, experts said. Other participants can see when your eyes wander. In more casual circumstances, like a catch-up between close colleagues, drafting an email during a meeting may be acceptable. Just let others know you’re taking care of a quick item on the side.It’s considered polite to mute yourself when you’re not speaking, especially if it’s a large meeting or if there’s noise in your background. But try to keep your camera on when you can, experts say. Turning it off may signal that you’re not paying attention.“When you’re working from a remote environment, remember you still have to be fully present and engaged,” said Esteve Boyd.All attendees, whether remote or in-person, should pay attention to their backgrounds.If you’re virtual, make sure your background is tidy and not distracting. A blank wall is fine, a work nook even better, Gottsman said. On formal video calls, you may not want to have your bed or dirty dishes behind you. And in some cases, such as in a busy coffee shop, you may have to blur the background, as people near you may not want to be seen in your meeting. Virtual backgrounds are also acceptable. Just make sure the image isn’t distracting with a lot of animation or flashing colors, said Esteve Boyd.In-person attendees should make sure that the background lighting isn’t too harsh; this can darken the image of the attendees in the room.If you regularly nail pick, swivel your chair, window watch, eye roll or slouch, you may unintentionally be broadcasting that you’re bored and unengaged.Body language and facial expressions become exceptionally important in hybrid meetings. Video conferencing tools not only enlarge the images of virtual attendees, but, in some cases, also give in-person attendees their own boxes on the screen, meaning every move and face you make becomes more obvious to others.“All these things are exaggerated on the screen,” Wyse said. “Be conscious of those things.”One of the benefits of hybrid meetings is that people can participate with their voices or via the chat. But not all chats are welcome, and an overactive chat can be distracting.“I would suggest using it sparingly,” Esteve Boyd said. “Sometimes I’m so busy reading the [chat] chain, I’m not listening to the speaker.”Meeting hosts can also disable the chat function if they find it too distracting, she added. And if your message in the chat is critical, you may also want to verbalize it, as in-person attendees may not catch the fleeting pop-up, Gottsman said.One of the most annoying things about hybrid meetings is that people often don’t feel included. Whether it’s interruptions because of video lag or funny things that happen in the room, isolating virtual attendees can happen often.“If something funny happens … make sure you say, ‘You may not have heard, but this is what was said,’” Esteve Boyd said. “It’s showing you are aware that they are still a part of the meeting.”Video delays can cause awkward interruptions from attendees accidentally talking over one another. It’s important that all attendees pause and make space for that delay so that everyone can chime in if they want to, Gottsman said. You also may have to make a hand gesture if you’re having trouble cutting in, Wyse added. Virtual participants can use the raise hand function. The problem may still occur from time to time, but the effort to include all attendees, especially those who are virtual, matters.“A successful meeting is one where everyone feels like they have space and permission to speak up,” Wyse said.Munching on-screen can be distracting and off-putting. So keep your snacks off-screen when you can.There are exceptions, such as lunch meetings, when everyone is eating or nibbling in a meeting because it’s the only chance they’ll get. But Gottsman said keep your camera on if possible.“I’d rather see you eating the sandwich, then have your camera off,” she said. “We really don’t know if you’re really there if it’s off.”But if you’re uncomfortable munching on camera, just let attendees know you’re turning off your camera to eat and flip it back on when you’re done, Esteve Boyd said.There may be times you’re dealing with extenuating circumstances and have to work from a noisy environment, leave early or join a meeting late. In those cases, it’s always best to tell attendees and the moderator up front, experts said.“Like all etiquette, it’s better to acknowledge,” Wyse said. “Explain that you’re in an odd situation.”A rule of thumb for meetings: Show up on time and end on time. This has become particularly important as many people now have back-to-back hybrid meetings, which can lead to video fatigue.There may be instances when you need to start the meeting a couple of minutes late, but always end on time, if not early, Gottsman said. Stay focused on the topic. If you have something to discuss at the end, unless it’s critical, follow up after the meeting.",7018,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/04/meeting-etiquette-hybrid-work/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,nibble awkward large anticipate extenuate thumb occasional blank bottom distraction meaning fully room enlarge business broadcasting listen entirely tidy feel change meeting pop email zoom author explain permission shop held especially acceptable standard top consider dress call back front overactive make obvious ping focus lead formal annoy attention window specializes video liz wander early rule draft host delay welcome code leave lag conferencing swivel cut funny colleague box close give side noisy image company conscious interrupt chime convey boyd school probably person spoke training start attendee office flash present debrett happen hybrid client accidentally problem eye time dirty blur join flip late talk work slouch lot level fleeting isolate hand chain mumble remember part couple guide pajama regularly expert expression engage reading pant modern contentment helpful exception odd conference executive circumstance kitchen fine coffee professional acknowledge notification stay heard sparingly tool behavior dish switch julia protocol successful expectation informal signal exceptionally bore voice breed turn interruption joke bed tip british language darken moderator disable microsoft pay message suggest raise phone environment year munch minute pause benefit san appearance virtual roll remote move item light diane facial add catch case watch discus texas occur aware deal background phase color worker space distract sandwich critical noise particularly chance coach steady chat gesture eat harsh pick matter lunch nail wyse etiquette verbalize casual consultant snack uncomfortable topic instance exaggerated participate show pandemic screen speak owner animation nook seat find habit entice follow function roommate chair gottsman mute wall unintentionally effort quick formality include important trouble polite participant busy camera meant,0.132,0.042747221430607,7.76449469964664,0.5590534792005379,0,2023-12-04
ABC,Spotify axes 17% of workforce in third round of layoffs this year,2023-12-04 05:48:00,The Associated Press,"LONDON -- Spotify says it's axing 17% of its global workforce, the music streaming service's third round of layoffs this year as it moves to slash costs while focusing on becoming profitable.In a message to employees posted on the company's blog Monday, CEO Daniel Ek said the jobs were being cut as part of a “strategic reorientation.” The post didn't specify how many employees would lose their jobs, but a spokesperson confirmed that it amounts to about 1,500 people.Spotify had used cheap financing to expand the business and “invested significantly” in employees, content and marketing in 2020 and 2021, the blog post said.But Ek indicated that the company was caught out as central banks started hiking interest rates last year, which can slow economic growth. Both are posing a challenge, he said.“We now find ourselves in a very different environment. And despite our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is still too big,” he said.Ek said the “leaner structure” of the company will ensure “Spotify’s continued profitability.”Stockholm-based Spotify posted a net loss of 462 million euros (about $500 million) for the nine months to September.The company announced in January that it was axing 6% of total staff.

Washington Post,What a teaspoon less of salt did for blood pressure in study,2023-12-04 05:30:00,not specified,"Reducing salt consumption by just one teaspoon a day could lower your blood pressure as much as hypertension medication, according to research presented at the American Heart Association’s recent Scientific Sessions and published in JAMA.The finding stems from a study of 213 adults, 50 to 75 years old, including people whose blood pressure was considered normal, as well as those with high blood pressure (hypertension), either treated or untreated.Researchers recorded the participants’ blood pressure after they had adhered, for one week, to a low-sodium diet — meals, snacks and beverages that included about one teaspoon less of table salt (2.3 grams of sodium) than their usual diet. That was compared with the participants’ blood pressure after they had consumed a high-sodium diet for a week. For nearly three-fourths of the participants, blood pressure was lower with the low-sodium diet.That diet resulted in, on average, a systolic blood pressure that was 8 mmHg (millimeters of mercury, the standard of measurement for blood pressure) lower than the systolic pressure recorded after a high-sodium diet, and 6 mmHg lower than after their usual diet.Systolic blood pressure — the top (or first) number in a blood pressure reading — represents the force produced by the heart when it beats, pushing blood through the arteries. The researchers wrote that their findings indicate that “clinically meaningful lowering of [blood pressure] through dietary sodium reduction can be achieved safely and rapidly within 1 week.”Having high blood pressure increases a person’s risk for heart disease, heart attack or stroke but also raises the likelihood of developing a range of health problems, including kidney disease, visual problems, sexual dysfunction and peripheral artery disease. Nearly half of U.S. adults — about 120 million people — have hypertension or are taking medication for it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",1956,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/12/04/salt-lower-blood-pressure/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OOS26JIMV5GT5JJKJOCWNEZQIQ.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OOS26JIMV5GT5JJKJOCWNEZQIQ.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OOS26JIMV5GT5JJKJOCWNEZQIQ.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OOS26JIMV5GT5JJKJOCWNEZQIQ.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OOS26JIMV5GT5JJKJOCWNEZQIQ.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OOS26JIMV5GT5JJKJOCWNEZQIQ.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,reading adhere reduce measurement control center diet average teaspoon blood beverage number dietary likelihood health research prevention standard top consider sexual result american lower millimeter write peripheral safely push raise year pressure publish half association sodium meaningful produce adult study represent indicate high recent hypertension force compare visual usual stem reduction consumption systolic low salt table session scientific normal week mercury develop risk kidney researcher snack day million medication person record mmhg consume rapidly dysfunction present find finding clinically heart disease problem treat stroke artery gram beat include increase attack participant range accord meal achieve,-0.74905,0.0,11.977971014492752,0.3289999999999999,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Inside Chopard’s new ‘anti-hotel’ for the ultra wealthy,2023-12-04 05:29:00,not specified,"Luxury jewelry and watch maker Chopard has quietly opened an “anti-hotel” in the heart of Paris, a new development in a growing category of hospitality in the French capital.Much about the brand’s first-ever hotel project — starting with its name, 1 Place Vendôme, and the property’s unusual lack of fanfare and self-promotion — seem atypical at first.Ahead of its official opening Nov 15, there was no usual barrage of social media posts from influencers in bathrobes, pretending to wake naturally in one of the luxurious 15 rooms and suites, cafe crèmes and croissant breakfasts placed aesthetically on unmade, rumpled beds.Nor do the hotel’s social media pages clamor for attention. At the time of writing, its Instagram page has one post and a little over 250 followers.The hotel itself, which occupies the floors above the existing Chopard boutique in the ritzy Place Vendôme square, is likewise easy to miss with a conspicuous lack of branded signage to announce its presence.It’s the kind of discretion that falls in line with one of the most aspirational lifestyles of today: Quiet luxury. But it also embodies one of the bigger marketing trends in the luxury world, the stealth launch.“We’re living in an age where, when you launch your products, it’s done with a big marketing campaign and a big event. It’s all kind of ceremonial,” said Karl-Fritz Scheufele in an interview with CNN. Karl-Fritz is the third generation of the Scheufele family — owners of Chopard since 1963 — and hotel spokesperson. “We wanted to do things differently… In a very targeted way.”That meant liaising directly with high-end travel agencies, being selective about their PR channels, and only opening the property to staying guests and VIP Chopard clients (meaning there’s no dropping in just for a drink at the bar).“There is a growing clientele that seeks exclusivity and privacy,” added project advisor Didier Le Calvez, a hospitality veteran whose portfolio includes upmarket hotels such as the Four Seasons George V and Le Bristol in Paris, and The Plaza and The Pierre in New York. “We wanted to create a semi-private hotel, like a really beautiful family residence.”It’s an experience that would be familiar, perhaps comforting even, for the world’s ultra-rich. After passing through the main blue doors and opening a wrought iron gate, emblazoned discreetly with a cursive “C” for Chopard, guests enter a high-ceilinged foyer and are greeted by the hotel butler. There is no front desk, nor scenes of guests jockeying in line to check in or out. Just a monumental 18th-century stone fireplace, a grand staircase and, in a subtle nod to the hotel’s heritage, a giant aquamarine Murano glass bead necklace installation by artist Jean-Michel Othoniel.Check-in is instead done at a small desk on the second floor, where shared common spaces are laid out like a stately manor home: salon, library, bar and a secret Chinese-inspired cigar lounge hidden behind a wall of false bookshelves.Also on the same floor is one of the hotel’s crowning jewels, the “Winter Garden,” a glass-roofed sitting room bathed in natural light, set against a mosaic mural that pays homage to Maison Chopard’s Animal World Collection. Featuring thousands of polished gemstones — called cabochons — it depicts an exotic jungle scene of peacocks, leopards, monkeys and butterflies.Located minutes from the Jardin des Tuileries and the Seine, Place Vendôme was commissioned by the Sun King Louis XIV; its centerpiece is a towering column erected by Napoleon I that commemorates the battle of Austerlitz. It is one of the most glamorous squares in Paris where haute jewelry and watch brands — Chopard, as well as Cartier, Chaumet, Boucheron, Breguet and Jaeger-LeCoultre — stand side-by-side.1 Place Vendôme also boasts royal lineage. Built in 1723 by Pierre Perrin, the secretary to the Sun King, its façades and roof are listed as historic monuments.Instead of choosing to name the hotel after the brand, the family chose the building’s address, 1 Place Vendôme. — this, said the brand, also enables the venture to stand alone, free of the associations that come with a luxury jewelry house.Not using the Chopard name is a strategy that breaks ranks with Bulgari, one of the early leaders in luxury fashion hoteliers that hedged its bets on brand recognition to fill up its hotel rooms. But it also falls in step with Audemars Piguet and Christian Louboutin, both of which recently opened properties under different names, Hôtel des Horlogers and Vermelho respectively.According to Florent Girardin, professor of luxury hospitality brand management at the prestigious EHL Hospitality Business School in Switzerland, the expansion from luxury fashion brand to hospitality is a natural one. While the Four Seasons or Ritz may know how to provide excellent service, luxury fashion houses are masters at creating and communicating desirability.“Historically, fashion luxury houses are dream-selling companies” Girardin said. “So this is a logical step.”Luxury experiences are also outgrowing the sale of luxury goods, he added.The building’s recent overhaul by designer Pierre-Yves Rochon took four years. Walls were knocked down, ceilings raised and the number of rooms halved (the previous tenant of the building was also a hotel) to create 10 suites and five rooms. Under the vision of Chopard co-president and artistic director Caroline Scheufele, the Paraiba suite (named after the maison’s Precious Lace Paraiba tourmaline necklace) features tropical-inspired hand-embroidered wall coverings. The chinoiserie in the Jade room includes evocative lacquerware, black, red, and gold furnishings, alongside Asian antique-inspired lattice carvings.But the Appartement Chopard on the sixth floor takes luxury one step further still. The gold-gilded suite glitters with crystal chandeliers hung from a 17-foot ceiling, marble fireplace and a voluminous bed canopy reminiscent of Versailles. Rates start at €14,000 ($15,400) per night. Regular rooms start at €1,400 ($1,540).While Paris has several 17th —19th century mansions that have been converted into boutique hotels, Le Calvez says 1 Place Vendôme raises the bar.“Our positioning is that of an anti-hotel,” added Scheufele. “We aren’t going to be the number one choice for first-time Paris visitors, there are plenty of wonderful hotels to fill that position,” he said.“I think we’re more for someone who has already seen a large part of hospitality in Paris and is looking for a new perspective.”",6514,https://www.cnn.com/style/chopard-hotel-place-vendome-paris/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/facade-1-crop.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,aquamarine jade plaza chinoiserie hôtel large selective medium installation enter social cnn meaning big depicts room number perrin target business homage nod boucheron unusual stand opening plenty exclusivity leopard category quietly monkey ritz director marketing tower croissant rumple instagram stone foyer garden florent common glamorous false jardin historic share thousand chose grow secretary commission call pretend crèmes quiet switzerland front bath event spokesperson veteran lattice breakfast pierre leader official wake mosaic attention expansion erect miss signage barrage boast master early lack service paris aesthetically beautiful exotic austerlitz association kind monumental vip enables polished precious glass alongside breguet centerpiece wrought murano product tuileries necklace floor comfort staircase emblazon commemorates usual prestigious subtle blue tourmaline convert roof announce maison small brand company artist atypical hedge piguet façades clamor portfolio tenant voluminous giant set rate york french built school bet hospitality ceiling regular management vermelho start today drop lounge season laid living heart client fashion louis peacock hidden jewelry time step provide iron stately artistic butler world ehl king lifestyle fanfare scheufele agency part jewel free post louboutin mural liaise paraiba exist girardin cigar versailles historically aspirational passing directly covering building black advisor break haute furnishing stay project bathrobe glitter instead recently drink easy red property campaign line maker privacy xiv manor suite different place royal reminiscent seek jungle vendôme naturally appartement bed write nov development home guest fireplace scene square luxury lace recognition strategy pay chaumet napoleon chopard family upmarket raise ceremonial boutique halve year minute gate designer grand secret feature knock interview light channel desk excellent sun natural stealth recent outgrow collection page add watch clientele cartier rochon familiar wonderful cursive audemars didier space evocative unmade travel bead pr night fall likewise bristol century bulgari address christian library calvez cabochon hung marble battle cafe experience bar winter embodies create discretion occupies crystal position venture mansion list check owner greet column fill heritage caroline ritzy conspicuous generation perspective communicate age lineage choose previous gemstone choice salon hotelier wall logical trend launch gold rank house crown canopy lacquerware include open visitor chandelier professor discreetly horlogers luxurious asian meant vision influencers george jockeying animal overhaul sixth,0.99385,0.0921093030396069,10.43361596009975,0.4220678345678345,0,2023-12-04
NPR,"Queen Latifah, Billy Crystal and others celebrated at Kennedy Center Honors",2023-12-04 05:00:00,Elizabeth Blair,"Among the artists who paid tribute to the Honorees were Kerry Washington, Jay Leno, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Whoopi Goldberg, Cynthia Erivo, Sigourney Weaver, Clive Davis, Missy Elliott and Ben Platt. The Honorees sat in the box tier with President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. Over the weekend they attended a reception at The White House and a dinner hosted by the State Department. Here's a recap of the gala which will air on CBS-TV and stream on Paramount+ on December 27th. Dionne Warwick (singer) Known as a vocalist with impeccable phrasing and warmth, Warwick scored dozens of hit songs beginning in the 1960s. Mickey Guyton performs for Dionne Warwick at the 46th Annual Kennedy Center Honors. Gail Schulman/Gail Schulman/CBS hide caption Mickey Guyton performs for Dionne Warwick at the 46th Annual Kennedy Center Honors. In the 1980s, she was one of the first celebrities to raise awareness about the AIDS epidemic. Choreographer and actor Debbie Allen, a 2021 Kennedy Center Honoree, remembered the time Warwick visited a pediatric hospital. ""She was so overcome that she picked up one of the babies, gave them a hug and a kiss which created quite a stir because, by doing so, she dispelled the myth that you could catch aids through touch,"" Allen recalled. In 1985, Warwick teamed up with Gladys Knight, Elton John, and Stevie Wonder to record ""That's What Friends Are For,"" a song that won two Grammys and raised millions of dollars for AIDS research. At the gala, her friend Gladys Knight performed ""Say A Little Prayer"" and Chloe Bailey sang ""Walk on By."" Billy Crystal (actor, comedian, filmmaker) ""He can be edgy, but you always feel the human side of him and he's not afraid to show his emotion which is rare for most comedians,"" said Rob Reiner who directed Crystal in When Harry Met Sally. Crystal's co-star Meg Ryan said that acting with him ""was effortless"" and even gave him credit for that iconic scene in the deli, ""The scene came really naturally to me and I really have Billy to thank for that,"" she joked. Meg Ryan gave Billy Crystal credit for the iconic scene in the deli in When Harry Met Sally at The 46th Annual Kennedy Center Honors.

Lin-Manuel Miranda performed a musical tribute to Crystal, the nine-time Academy Awards host. Whoopi Goldberg told the audience the Academy should give him a special Oscar for his legendary hosting skills, and poignantly recalled the Comic Relief shows she did with Crystal and Robin Williams. Queen Latifah (rapper, singer, and actress)Queen Latifah is now the first female rapper to win a Kennedy Center Honor. With songs like ""U.N.I.T.Y."" and ""Ladies First,"" she took on hip hop at a time when it was even more male dominated than it is today. A number of female rappers came to the Kennedy Center to pay their respects including M.C. Lyte, Monie Love, Missy Elliott and Rapsody.

Kerry Washington explained that, when she was 8 years old, Dana Elaine Owens ""flipped through a book of names and chose one as her own: Latifah, an Arabic name meaning gentle, kind and pleasant. This is how she saw herself. And then at age 17, when it was time to create her professional moniker, she added the title Queen. And in doing so, this young black woman from East Orange, New Jersey, crafted the lens through which the world would forever see her."" Renée Fleming (soprano)Several opera stars came out to show their appreciation of Renée Fleming, a five time Grammy winner and U.S. National Medal of Arts recipient. Angel Blue, Julia Bullock, Ailyn Perez, Nadine Sierra and Patrick Summersperformed Rusalka's ""Song to the Moon.""

""Everybody thought it was a novel about her,"" Patchett said, ""and it should have been...because the soprano that I wrote about had a peerless coloratura voice that could stop time."" Barry Gibb (singer, songwriter, record producer)Guinness World Records and Billboard list Gibb as one of the two most successful popular songwriters of all time, alongside Paul McCartney. With his late brothers Robin and Maurice, the Bee Gees sold over 220 million records. Ariana DuBose, Little Big Town and Ben Platt were among the artists who performed some of his songs. At the State Department dinner Saturday evening Gibb said, ""I know that without my brothers, I wouldn't be standing here.""

Fox News,Wait. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry aren't behind latest hatchet job against Britain's royals?,2023-12-04 05:00:00,Lee Cohen,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have failed famously in their crusade to destroy and damage the British royal family. As opinion polls display, they have inflicted significant self-harm in the process. The release of the much-hyped book, ""Endgame"" by the Sussexes’ purported ""mouthpiece,"" reporter Omid Scobie, is the latest, sad attempt to harm the monarchy. It mostly rehashes old gossip, while professing not to emanate from the duplicitous duo.Commentators swarmed the airwaves in the UK over the past few days blasting Scobie’s claim that he had no contact with the Sussexes in writing his latest tome. Scobie’s latest pronouncements hardly seem reassuring given his past contradictions.In 2020, Scobie penned the obsequious Meghan and Harry biography, ""Finding Freedom,"" promising similar third-party independence from the book’s subjects. However, though the Sussexes denied any involvement in the book’s writing, their former press secretary Jason Knauf exposed this as a falsehood.NEW BOOK ON ROYAL FAMILY HIT FOR BEING 'SYMPATHETIC' TO HARRY AND MEGHAN: 'PRESS RELEASE COOKED UP BY CHATGPT'In courtroom evidence, Knauf revealed that the book was ""discussed directly with the duchess multiple times in person and over email."" He testified that Markle had actually given him briefing points to share with Scobie.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are featured in the latest book that bashes the royals – ""Endgame."" (Chris Jackson)Now in 2023, we are again being asked to swallow that the Sussexes exerted no influence on Scobie’s latest hatchet job against Britain’s royals. And now we are being spun that a ""translation error"" resulted in the names of two putative royal racists having been left in the now-retracted Dutch version of ""Endgame,"" while they did not appear in the English one. No doubt, some readers will accept this gullibly enough.Scobie, much like the Sussexes themselves, has burned his bridges with the monarchy. That seems to have deprived him of exposure to the House of Windsor or its universe. That forced him to recycle a lot of material.So much so, that even the normally pro-Sussex, monarchy-averse New York Times couldn’t summon much enthusiasm for ""Endgame,"" writing, ""We’ve heard much of it before. From Fergie, from Diana, from Charles, from Harry, from Harry, from Harry again.""Whether briefed by them directly or not, the meat of the book — a cavalcade of smears and gossip — flows directly from the Sussexes’ grievance playbook.There is Scobie’s (highly welcome) revelation that Markle won’t, ""dive back into the royal soap opera."" How absurdly ironic, considering it was she who created and stoked the drama of the lives of the royal family, stooping even to torment the last years of global treasures Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.Scobie rehashes much of the old gossip circulated by Harry and Meghan: king against sons, brother against brother, sister-in-law against sister-in-law. But he takes the reader for fools. Scobie suggests that Kate regarded Meghan as a rival. Really? The beloved, beautiful, hard-working future queen might indeed be put off by Markle’s narcissism and appalling behavior. But in what universe could such a successful royal feel any rivalry from a publicity-driven actress-turned social influencer?Let’s face it: without the link to the royal family, as the Sussexes’ plummeting popularity and Hollywood failures have shown, there is very little to interest the public in the second-rate actress and her victim-prince.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONScobie expressed in an interview this week: ""Meghan has made it clear that she never wants to be involved in the British monarchy again."" The newly released book, written by a surrogate, is a way to spread the Sussexes’ poison while letting them remain above the fray.Whether briefed by them directly or not, the meat of the book — a cavalcade of smears and gossip — flows directly from the Sussexes’ grievance playbook.King Charles and his heir Prince William have cut themselves off from the Sussexes' treachery. As for the failed royal couple, their marginalization has only proved hurtful to their reputations.As I reported on these pages, the duke and duchess’s constant attacks on the royal family, their unceasing victimhood narratives, poor work ethic and uninspiring content production have rendered them box office poison. Both the Sussexes and Scobie have attacked the very people who made them relevant and notable and keep them there.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn a laudable rare moment of clarity, Scobie realizes early in the pages of his book, ""Part of this book will burn my bridges for good. But to tell the full story, there’s no holding back. Not anymore. We’re in the endgame.""This could be his endgame. Like Harry and Meghan, he will emerge richer, but reputationally bankrupt.

NPR,"Purdue Pharma, Sacklers' OxyContin settlement lands at the Supreme Court",2023-12-04 05:00:00,Nina Totenberg,"Under the terms of the deal approved by a lower court, Purdue Pharma—the maker, aggressive peddler, and deceptive marketer of Oxycontin— agreed to pay billions of dollars to those harmed in the opioid epidemic. In exchange, the deal shields members of the Sackler family from personal liability, though they owned and ran the company. Just what happened at Purdue Pharma, and what the Sacklers did, was not known for a long time. Now, however, their role and the company's have been well documented, in court and movies, books, and documentaries, like Crime of the Century. ""Within the last 20 years, more than 500,000 Americans have been killed by overdoses,"" the documentary recounts. ""This was a new drug cartel. They were drug dealers wearing suits and lab coats."" By 2020, Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to three criminal charges. The company agreed that it owed $8 billion in criminal and civil fines, most of it to be paid to state and local governments handling the fallout of the opioid crisis. Most of the money was conditioned on the company reaching a deal in bankruptcy court that would reimburse victims of the opioid epidemic, including those state and local governments, as well as individuals who were harmed. That deal that is at the center of Monday's case because it releases the Sacklers from personal liability, despite the fact that all three of the original Sackler brothers who bought Purdue and ultimately developed OxyContin were doctors. And, six Sacklers sat on the board of the company, including the chairman Richard Sackler, who closely directed the firm's aggressive and deceptive marketing strategy of OxyContin as not causing addiction. Under the original bankruptcy deal with the company, the Sacklers kicked in $4 billion to be divided among the state and local governments, and others. But, at the same time the Sackler family members were to be released from any further liability. When eight states and the District of Columbia balked at the amount, the Sacklers upped the ante to $6 billion, with the remaining $2 billion coming from the assets and future earnings of a new non-profit company formed after Purdue's dissolution. After the Sacklers increased their contribution to $6 billion, the objecting states withdrew their opposition, and 95% of the state, local and tribal governments, as well as groups of individuals voted to approve the settlement. But, United States Trustee William Harrington, who oversees bankruptcy cases in New York, Connecticut and Vermont, objected to the deal. Representing him in the Supreme Court Monday, the Biden administration will argue that the bankruptcy law does not authorize bankruptcy courts to approve a release from liability for third parties like the Sacklers. Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin says that the Sacklers' $6 billion to be paid over eight years is buying them not only a release from liability, it is ensuring that they will not have to testify about their misdeeds in future litigation, and they will be able to keep about half of their money and other assets. ""The Sacklers do not want to have to be in the bankruptcy fishbowl,"" Levitin says. ""They're wanting to get bankruptcy at half price."" Levitan add that the release from liability covers more than just the Sacklers. It also includes lots of other Sackler acolytes, from their lawyers to consultants, doctors, even former Sen. Luther Strange, who was a Purdue lobbyist after leaving the Senate. ""None of them have to pay a dime,"" he observers, but all of them would be released from liability in the deal. ""Bankruptcy is supposed to provide relief for honest but unfortunate debtors. And those are people who file for bankruptcy and pay the price. They come clean about their assets and give up all of their assets to their creditors,"" says Levitin. ""The Sacklers are not doing either of those things."" Not everyone who studies bankruptcy agrees. ""I think its backseat driving to say that it's not good enough,"" Columbia Law professor Edward Morrison says. ""The perfect can't be the enemy of the good."" Indeed, as Morrison notes, the Sacklers have had 20 years to hide their money overseas in places that are perhaps possible but costly and time consuming to reach. ""Do we want to burn up value reaching those assets and those people, or do we want to just pay the money that's available to the victims?"" Morrison asks. ""Maybe its a tradeoff we wouldn't have to make in an ideal world. But we don't live in a perfect world."" Bankruptcy court has a special role to play particularly in large cases like this, he notes, because this is the one place where a settlement can be reached with so many victims from so many places, with so many diverse interests. That said, though, the Supreme Court has, of late, signaled its skepticism about bankruptcy judges, viewing them as a lesser form of judge because they serve for limited terms and are appointed by courts of appeal, not the president. And yet, as Morrison points out, bankruptcy courts serve as something of ""a safety valve"" for dealing with wrongful conduct that results in mass injuries. So, if the justices do reverse the Purdue Pharma deal, Morrison says, ""it'll be a huge mess.""",5213,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1215717223/purdue-sacklers-oxycontin-supreme-court,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,withdrew levitan observer developed center large suppose bought note ran marketing live sacklers acolyte crisis money board coat american creditor fishbowl balk make harrington sackler wrongful closely member connecticut skepticism half victim law drive leave debtor georgetown dime oversees richard special book movie give doctor role company plead paid shield harm misdeed point chairman guilty dollar long cartel trustee liability future injury mass york biden safety diverse testify possible government wear remain president unfortunate hide happen clean agree levitin handle lesser administration time provide brother luther lab late reverse world district strange lot aggressive asks fallout increase condition indeed morrison vote civil ultimately addiction cover exchange suit owe marketer despite peddler fine local documentary opioid release oxycontin state crime ensure overdoses argue group enemy costly maker signal criminal place valve view charge perfect ideal vermont individual court result backseat strategy pay term family year opposition sat approve value edward lawyer reach lobbyist represent study amount object upped form agrees add appeal case tribal asset dissolution supreme monday deal document conduct low available party relief limited purdue direct personal particularly huge century buying original overseas dealer price settlement kill consultant pharma mess play fact senate consume litigation bankruptcy epidemic firm appoint earnings kick tradeoff united contribution university divide recount include professor columbia serve authorize deceptive former william reimburse honest justice burn judge file billion adam interest,0.8565,0.1150968732016113,8.201684622918709,0.4430248917748918,0,2023-12-04

The song is named after famed escape artist, Harry Houdini, and she explained ""the whole idea of it is Houdini-ing"" when it comes to relationships. It happens when a person realizes ""there are too many red flags here and I gotta dip,"" and then follows through.""It could be anything from chewing and talking with your mouth open… I don’t know,"" she told Tony Fly and Symon for Hits 1 LA in a November 2023 interview regarding her icks, before adding, ""little ankle socks"" are also a no for her.

You have to have some sort of a balanced lifestyle. High maintenance, I’m out the door. I’ve never been a part of that.

Fox News,What is an Advent wreath and what do its candles mean during this holy season?,2023-12-04 04:30:00,Christine Rousselle,"During the liturgical season of Advent, many churches opt to display an Advent wreath as a way to mark the days and weeks leading up to Christmas and the birth of Jesus Christ.But what is an Advent wreath? Where did the practice originate from — and what do the candles and their colors mean?""Advent,"" which derives from the Latin word ""adventus,"" means ""coming, approach, arrival."" It is the liturgical season that immediately precedes Christmas.In addition to being a season of preparation, Advent is also a season of penance, ""in the sense of preparing, quieting and disciplining our hearts for the full joy of Christmas,"" notes the website for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT IS A REMINDER TO ‘WATCH’ AND PREPARE FOR CHRIST'S SECOND COMING, SAYS FAITH LEADERAdvent has many unique traditions and customs associated with it. Perhaps the most famous of those is the Advent wreath.Churches for centuries have displayed Advent wreaths, says the website for the Christian prayer app Hallow, but it is unclear when and why it began to be used.An Advent wreath has four candles — three purple, one pink — and sometimes a white candle is placed in the center, called the ""Christ candle."" One additional candle is lit each Sunday of Advent, and the Christ candle is lit on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. (iStock)The practice comes from Germany, said Hallow, and is possibly a Christianized adaptation of a pre-Christian Germanic winter tradition anticipating the return of spring.By the 1600s, both Catholic and Lutheran churches in Germany established traditions of the Advent wreath. These traditions would spread over time, and Advent wreaths are now commonly found in the homes and churches of those of the Christian faith all over the world.In modern times, an Advent wreath is typically made of some sort of evergreen boughs. It contains four candles: three that are purple or violet, and one that is pink or rose.HALLOW APP ANNOUNCES COLLABORATION WITH LIAM NEESON FOR NEW ADVENT SERIES THIS YEARThe candles are lit each Sunday. On the first Sunday of Advent, one purple candle is lit; the second, two purple candles; the third, two purple candles and the pink candle; and finally, all four are lit on the final Sunday of Advent.The candles, in order of the weeks of Advent, symbolize hope, peace, joy and love, said Hallow. The colors correspond to the traditional colors of vestments worn by clergy during Advent.Advent wreaths originated in Germany, and may have evolved from a pre-Christian winter tradition. (iStock)Sometimes, a white candle is placed in the center of the wreath; it's referred to as the ""Christ candle.""This candle is lit on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.In 2023, with Christmas Day on a Monday, the fourth Sunday of Advent falls on Christmas Eve.'HALLOW' PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE, COMPANY SAYS: 'PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK'Liturgically, this means that the fourth Sunday of Advent will be observed from sundown on Saturday through sundown on Sunday, and the Christmas liturgy will be celebrated on Sunday evening through Monday.For Rev. Hans Fiene, pastor of Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Crestwood, Missouri, Advent wreaths are ""a beautiful reminder to slow down, focus and prepare our hearts for the arrival of our King, who first came to us in Bethlehem's manger.""Advent wreaths have been found in Christian churches for over 400 years.

USA TODAY,Taylor Swift makes fifth NFL appearance to support Travis Kelce,2023-12-04 00:56:57,not specified,"Taylor Swift has entered Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, for her fifth NFL appearance to support her boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs as they take on the Packers. But honestly baby who's counting... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... The star was wearing a vibrant red, Stella McCartney belted teddy coat that draped past her knees, a Cartier diamond and gold necklace with a sleek, modest black top, black skirt, black tights and black thigh-high leather boots. The temperature at the game was a 30 degrees Fahrenheit with light snow. Fans in the stadium held ""Go Taylor's Boyfriend #87"" signs. The 12-time Grammy award winner has visited most of the NFL stadiums for the American leg of her widely successful ""Eras Tour."" Swift was spotted in a suite sitting next to quarterback Patrick Mahomes wife, Brittany Mahomes. Swift started visiting them again to support the All-Pro tight end. Sports analysts and reporters such as USA Today's Jordan Mendoza have reported, there is nothing but good news when she is in the crowd. The team is 4-0 with Swift in attendance and Kelce has had 34 catches, run 432 yards and completed two touchdowns. Swift made her first NFL appearance to support Kelce at Arrowhead Stadium on September 24. Seen next to Kelce's mom, she cheered as Kelce and the team dominated the Chicago Bears 41-10. On October 1, she attended the Chiefs New York Jets game at MetLife Stadium, bringing her full entourage of friends Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Sophie Turner and ""Deadpool 3"" director Shawn Levy.

ABC,"Plan to add teaching of Holocaust, genocide to science education draws questions from Maine teachers",2023-12-04 00:13:00,PATRICK WHITTLE Associated Press,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- Teachers and science advocates are voicing skepticism about a Maine proposal to update standards to incorporate teaching about genocide, eugenics and the Holocaust into middle school science education. They argue that teachers need more training before introducing such subjects that are both sensitive and nuanced.While critics of the proposed updates said they are borne of good intentions — the proposal states that science has “sometimes been used by those in power to oppress and abuse others” — they also said that injecting the materials into a middle school science curriculum could distract from conventional scientific principles and could jeopardize science education.The proposal states that science education in the state should reflect that “misinterpretation of fossil observations has led to the false idea of human hierarchies and racial inequality.” The proposal also states that “historically, some people have misused and/or applied the ideas of natural selection and artificial selection to justify genocide of various groups, such as Albinos in Africa or Jews in Europe.”The proposed updates have drawn the attention of teachers' groups in the state as well as national organizations that advocate for a better understanding of science. The concern in Democrat-controlled Maine contrasts conflicts over education in some more conservative states, where criticism has focused on the teaching of climate change, U.S. history and evolution in recent years.The Maine Science Teachers Association testified before the state that adding the proposed content to education standards without providing professional training for teachers could jeopardize science education. The updates, which are geared toward middle schoolers, could also make it harder for young minds to absorb the more basic science concepts they are encountering for the first time, said Tonya Prentice, president of the Maine Science Teachers Association.“As far as critical thinking skills, middle school students are still developing those, and that's just putting it at a level that is fundamentally higher than we should expect them to handle,” Prentice said. “That's a lot for adults to take in.”Others said they felt the state is well-intentioned to try to incorporate social history into science education, but agreed Maine needs to first ensure that its teachers are equipped to do it. The contributions scientists have made to theories like eugenics belong in science class, but it needs to be done right, said Joseph Graves Jr., a professor of biology who is on the board of directors of the National Center for Science Education, which includes hundreds of teachers.“The question is, should those things be incorporated into science class? My answer is absolutely yes,” Graves Jr. said. “But it comes down to when to do that and whether the people doing it are doing it in a way that is knowledgeable and pedagogically sound.”The Maine Department of Education is performing the update, which is part of a review of standards that is required every five years. The proposed updates would have to ultimately be approved by a committee of the Maine Legislature.The Maine Department of Education took public comments about the proposal until the middle of November and the next step is for the Legislature's Education and Cultural Affairs Committee to make a determination about the standards, said Marcus Mrowka, a spokesperson for the education department.The updates are the result of new requirements from the Legislature to include certain kinds of education into the curriculum, Mrowka said. Schools are now required to include content about Native American and African American histories as well as the history of genocide, including the Holocaust, Mrowka said. Mrowka said the update doesn't constitute a change to the standards but rather represents the inclusion of a further explanation section to provide educators with additional contexts and opportunities to encourage critical thinking.The recommended updates that are up for adoption were made by teachers, and the education department opened up the revision process to any science teachers who wanted to be involved, Mrowka said. A group of two dozen Maine science educators met several times over the summer to lead the review of the science standards, Mrowka said.The teachers also worked with scholars and experts to include the additional content areas that the Legislature required, Mrowka said.“The teachers included a further explanation section to provide educators with additional contexts and opportunities to encourage critical thinking that incorporate the additional content required by the Legislature,” Mrowka said.The state sought public comments about the current science standards earlier in the year and received numerous comments from educators about the importance of challenging students. Middle schoolers can grapple with “rigorous and relevant learning for the world that we live in,” testified Robert Ripley, a sixth grade teacher in the Oxford Hills School District.“We want our students to be the builders of tomorrow, and they need the skills to create that unknown future world,” Ripley testified.Alison Miller, an associate professor at Bowdoin College who served on the state steering committee for science standards, called the revisions “misguided.” Miller said the heavy subjects of genocide and scientific racism seemed to be shoehorned into the standards.",5468,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/plan-add-teaching-holocaust-genocide-science-education-draws-105349897,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/dba0c551-380e-4345-8f63-46cc921a59f3/wirestory_b57ff8e139049df22b17f5a4748f4c40_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,middle holocaust national concern center mind student social content additional schoolers africa change graf public subject comment director live put human encourage false standard heavy introduce board answer american current selection call organization make spokesperson power lead focus attention belong mrowka ripley skepticism conservative expect dozen association kind adult teacher high misuse hill sought equip earlier felt advocate cultural context scientific basic criticism determination jeopardize genocide young theory absolutely future propose school scientist affair proposal abuse testify training learn grade president sensitive incorporate agree miller handle provide time step world harder work lot recommend level conventional unknown idea part absorb understand skill committee pedagogically expert fossil ultimately curriculum racism education question historically contrast college joseph eugenics professional artificial state relevant ensure perform tonya revision associate argue department legislature marcus group requirement opportunity knowledgeable misinterpretation voice robert history result hundred review teach involve native receive challenge material year approve adoption fundamentally represent conflict drawn concept natural recent importance add area observation albino oppress augusta builder reflect encounter require distract critic critical principle prentice constitute shoehorn develop borne apply class scholar create evolution steer inject inclusion grapple african science jew bowdoin educator climate november section process tomorrow summer contribution explanation numerous open include racial justify professor biology rigorous serve intention update gear hierarchy oxford sixth,0.5659000000000001,0.1097293343087051,13.58430601092896,0.3818449471675278,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,"Carolyn Hax: Wait, doesn’t everyone resent the ‘thin, young, hot’ fiancée?",2023-12-04 00:00:00,Carolyn Hax,"Adapted from an online discussion.Dear Carolyn: I am 39, and I have three younger brothers. One of them is engaged and living with his fiancée, and one weekend last summer we all stayed with him. And I cannot stand his fiancée.Part of it is on principle: My brother is 37, and she is 26. He is a doctor, and I think he focused on getting established, and when he wanted to have kids, he picked a younger woman. I have a lot of female friends in their 30s who describe dating as very hard specifically because men want younger women.The other part is that she is such a Stepford wife. She is a teacher and was off for the summer. Their entire house was clean and organized, she had meals or local restaurants planned, she made activities suggestions for our other brother’s kids, and looked incredible — thin, young, hot. It feels like my smart, accomplished brother picked a young, hot woman instead of somebody his own age who is too busy with a career to put cereal in plastic bins.I agreed to be a bridesmaid because I couldn’t think of a way to say no. But I don’t know how to fake it for an entire wedding.My husband just says, “She was very nice to us,” which is true if you just look at the surface. I need help not tearing my hair out.— AnonymousAnonymous: Please reread your letter. It is ageist, petty, cruel, bedazzled with cheap assumptions and ungrateful to the point of comedy.Your brother chose, from your description, a kind, generous, inclusive and conscientious person with one of the most difficult, underpaid and self-sacrificing careers out there, and she busted her shapely backside to host you all — and you hate her for her looks. Holy tap-dancing mean.If she were 26 and fat, would you like her then? Or still thin, but 36? What about 26, thin, leaves dishes stacked in the sink? Unthreatening enough?You offer no examples of her being thoughtless, destructive, mean, passive-aggressive, dishonest.I’m sorry your friends can’t get dates. That you correlate one man’s choice of one woman with collective female suffering just gave me “domestic supply of infants” flashbacks that I could have done without today.You can worry about demographic trends, yes — but using trends to impugn individual choices and presume you’d make better ones crosses just about all the lines.Here’s my advice: Sit with your reasons for trashing her — and some reasons not to — for a good, long time.Readers have thoughts:· Please stop judging people’s life choices, especially women’s. Sisters need to pull together instead of tearing each other down.· As a married working mom who at 37 still had time to buy cereal in bulk and decant it into storage bins, I am struck by just how many insecurities the fiancée brings out in Anonymous. Actually hating a person for their age and approach to housekeeping looks like misplaced energy.· My superstar, 10-years-older sister-in-law used her words and told me well in advance she had no need to be part of our wedding party. If she disliked my anxious, insecure self, she’s never given any indication, and I have appreciated the chance to get to know her over time.",3113,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/12/04/carolyn-hax-young-hot-fiancee-brother/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,suffer ageist impugn stand woman feel plastic put especially backside supply tear trash chose storage domestic make brings underpaid focus establish approach married kid bridesmaid host kind stayed difficult teacher disliked unthreatening friend sink weekend correlate shapely give doctor advice reason plan date point young reread inclusive long female judging entire life pull stack picked holy person insecurity adapt struck specifically misplace clean agree living generous superstar time brother housekeep incredible work lot stepford description buy part wedding meal engage cross presume surface word smart cheap stop bulk career local hate petty infant instead hard dish letter destructive sister collective thoughtless decant fake individual demographic advance cruel activity offer husband wife fiancée ungrateful cereal hot conscientious thin insecure sorry worry describe assumption party appreciate online principle chance fat flashback organize bedazzle carolyn anxious accomplish hair age leaf choice summer trend house indication anonymous told busy nice mom restaurant anonymousanonymous bust suggestion,-0.7515000000000001,0.1927401220687439,7.139905511811023,0.5591419586702607,0,2023-12-04
Washington Post,Ask Amy: A toy kitchen brings up gender stereotype questions,2023-12-04 00:00:00,Amy Dickinson,"Dear Amy: My husband and I have a daughter, “Emma.” She is 3. We are thoughtful and responsible parents (at least we think so …). We have a question about gift-giving.Our daughter goes to a nursery school program a couple of mornings a week, and it’s going very well. While at school, she loves to play with a miniature kitchen set. It’s got a little sink and a pretend stove with pots and pans.We told my sister that we are thinking about getting a version of this for our daughter for Christmas (my sister also has children), but she is strongly disapproving because, as she says, this sort of toy “reinforces gender stereotypes.”Now we feel weird about it and decided to seek your take.— Wondering ParentsWondering: Many parents are concerned about reinforcing gender stereotypes … right up until that moment when their toddler son really loves to play with his cousin’s toy bulldozer or their daughter falls in love with a Tiny Tammy doll.Are you willing to deny your child the joy and learning experience of playing with an object she really loves in order to please your sister, or to pat yourselves on the back about adhering consistently to your powerful ideals? I hope not.In my opinion, you have absorbed the very real issue of gender stereotyping in a sideways fashion. The idea is not to deny your child toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender, but to expansively offer them toys and experiences that are typically associated with any gender.You might think of play (like gender) as occurring across a spectrum that the child has the power and autonomy to determine as they go — not the parents (or, for that matter, the marketing departments of toy companies).And so — if your son wants a Tiny Tammy doll, he should receive it and be encouraged/allowed to play with it, and if your daughter chooses to wash her toy bulldozer in her pretend kitchen sink, then more power to her.The boundary I would draw (this Christmas and into the future) is around toys that encourage violence or mimic weaponry.(And yes, we all know that your daughter can pretend her Wiffle ball bat is a gun, but at the end of the day, she knows it’s a Wiffle ball bat.)Dear Amy: My mother died five years ago. I financially supported my stepfather for three of those five years and spent quality time with him. He met another woman and deliberately hid the fact that he was dating her from me and my sister. He decided to sell the house I grew up in. He wouldn’t tell me where he was moving to.Now my sister is angry with me because I choose not to participate in her family gatherings, which he attends with his new partner. This man refused to tell me the truth, after I asked him repeatedly. The members of my mother’s family have disowned me for it.Am I in the wrong?— JDJD: Let’s say that I could somehow magically determine that you are “right.” Would it then fix things for you to present an Ask Amy Certificate of Rightness (TM) to your family members? I doubt it.So let me sidestep trying to determine whether your behavior is wrong. This is more a social and family dilemma than an ethical one. I don’t know why your stepfather is avoiding you. Perhaps he is worried that you believe he owes you money (because of your previous financial support). He might be ashamed of some of his own actions and too embarrassed to face you. He might be cowardly overall, or legitimately afraid of you. Your family members seem to have circled the wagons around this man, and your reaction has placed you outside the circle.If you were open to it — versus only defending your own position — you might take a look around and at least ask yourself what you might be doing to inspire your entire family to disengage from you.Dear Amy: Responding to “TikToked-Off,” like them, I used to feel uncomfortable having my photo and video taken. I had a friend who would film no matter what I said. This friend died suddenly, and now looking at the videos frozen in time helps me grapple with my loss and closure.From my perspective, unless you’re in the witness protection program or filmed indecently, you may someday truly treasure those captured moments.— RememberedRemembered: I genuinely appreciate your perspective.

Washington Post,Miss Manners: How to respond when people say I’m overdressed?,2023-12-04 00:00:00,Judith Martin,"Dear Miss Manners: How should I respond when someone comments that I appear too stylish or well dressed?This happened at a casual luncheon at a friend’s home. I pointed out that I was wearing jeans and a T-shirt. My thought had been that the hostess had put a lot of effort into her luncheon, so my outfit should reflect a bit of effort, too. The commenter said the wide-leg jeans, linen blazer and suede flats made my outfit too stylish. I was also told I was too dressed up when I wore a white denim skirt, floral blouse, flat sandals and coordinating purse for a restaurant lunch with friends.It’s not as if I am wearing a ballgown for a hike in the woods, nor am I wearing designer logos and tons of expensive jewelry. I’m only elevating my casual wear a tiny bit.What was your critic wearing that she considered jeans and a T-shirt “too stylish”?For that matter, what does “too stylish” even mean? Surely she cannot be suggesting that such a long-established, universal, unassuming outfit was indicative of a slavish devotion to the latest fashion industry pronouncements. (And even the fashion industry is aware that this dictation no longer works.)Perhaps you and Miss Manners are wasting time parsing a rude person’s muddled insult. But there is a lot of that sort of casual unpleasantness going around. To justify their own lack of effort — whether to look nice or to otherwise make things pleasant — people will make snarky remarks about the efforts of others.What should you have said? “Thank you, I’m glad you like it.”Dear Miss Manners: I’ve had just about enough of a certain action I see at parties: I feel it’s absolutely rude to decline a piece of the cake. Sorry to all who think “politely declining” is polite. Take a piece of the darn cake and throw it out later if you can’t eat it. If you’re full, dieting, diabetic or even allergic, just graciously accept it and the host will move on happily.The cake is made with all the guests in mind, and that costs a lot of time and money. And if, like me, there’s no medical reason not to eat it, taste a piece for good luck. What is your professional opinion?That “No, thank you” is a response that should be respected. Miss Manners suggests you calm down by ending your practice of monitoring what anyone — other than your own child — does or does not eat.Dear Miss Manners: My family planned a large gathering at my home to take place right after my husband’s funeral. The morning of the funeral, I went to pick up a number of food trays at the local grocery store.A woman standing at the counter commented about the big party I must be having and how she wished she could come. I responded that it wasn’t what she thought. I walked away and went to the car to cry. Even if people think their unsolicited comment is well intentioned, it may be hurtful. I remember this each time a person who believes they are just being friendly and engaging makes a similar none-of-their-business comment to me.You showed great restraint in not quietly mentioning what the food was for. Doing so might even have taught someone that, as Miss Manners keeps saying, it is hurtful to make assumptions about others.New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Washington Post,Kennedy Center Honors: Off-script moments energize the stately affair,2023-12-03 23:56:00,Travis M. Andrews,"It was a giddy night in Washington. Well, a giddy weekend.The Kennedy Center Honors is always a stately affair, and Sunday evening was no different — with President Biden and first lady Jill Biden, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and second gentleman Doug Emhoff in attendance.But this year a chaotic energy pumped though its veins. Being honored in the arts center’s 2,364-seat Opera House: comedian Billy Crystal, opera soprano Renée Fleming, Bee Gees singer-songwriter Barry Gibb, hip-hop pioneer and actress Queen Latifah, and singer (and legendary tweeter) Dionne Warwick.Everything that’s usually on the menu was present. Hair-raising musical performances. Touching tributes from past honorees. Biographical videos. Amusing bits. Herbie Hancock.While it was lovely as always, the air was charged. Spontaneous, off-script, offbeat moments elevated the night. Like when the entire crowd of politicos and arts enthusiasts thrust their hands back and forth and swayed to a hip-hop medley honoring Latifah.Two such unplanned moments came from Robert De Niro, honoring his friend and “Analyze This” co-star Billy Crystal. At one point, he sang a version of “It Had to Be You” but lost the words halfway through. He began improvising, singing in melody: “I’m f---ing it up, but it’s okay!” The crowd roared, almost as much as when De Niro said that Crystal, at 75, is “six years from being the perfect age to be elected president” — and Biden responded by standing, smiling, waving and pointing at the actor.Rita Moreno also had some thoughts on age. While introducing Latifah, she couldn’t make out the words on the teleprompter at the back of the room, instead having to read from a piece of paper. “Isn’t getting old so f---ing boring?” she announced. The audience enthusiastically disagreed.Otherwise, it was business as usual and business was booming.As always, the evening is composed of five segments, each running about 20 minutes and each dedicated to an honoree, with friends, family and creative partners celebrating them in various ways.For Warwick, the night’s first honoree, that meant booming covers of her songs. Mickey Guyton and the Spinners joined to perform “Then Came You.” Cynthia Erivo earned a standing ovation with a tremendous version of “Alfie” as projected stars twinkled overhead. Gladys Knight, a 2022 honoree, sang “Say a Little Prayer.”And, for a dash of laughter, Ego Nwodim — who impersonates Warwick on “Saturday Night Live” — spoke about the time Warwick appeared with her on the show. Their SNL skit ended with a duet of “What the World Needs Now Is Love,” and Nwodim, understandably nervous, wanted to repeatedly rehearse the song. Warwick had other ideas: “I know the song.”Crystal was honored by friends Rob Reiner, Bob Costas, Jay Leno and De Niro. First, though, “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda performed his version of a Billy Crystal Oscars-style medley, singing about the comedian’s career to the tune of “My Favorite Things.”Meg Ryan, Crystal’s co-star in the 1989 rom-com “When Harry Met Sally …,” spoke in front of an onstage replica of New York City’s Katz’s Deli, where her character memorably moaned in one scene. “I’m surprised they let me back into this place,” she said. Later, she gently ribbed Crystal: “I’ve never been around anyone who makes faking an orgasm easier.”For his part, though, De Niro may have had both the unscripted and scripted laugh line of the night, when he said the country “honors the O.G. Billy Crystal on this 50th anniversary of hip-hop.”Queen Latifah’s family — including her father and sister, her best friends, a couple of her aunts, an uncle and a cousin — appeared in a video. “That ‘Equalizer’ show is just the bomb,” said one aunt.The rest of Latifah’s segment — introduced by 5-year-old rapper VanVan, featured performances by MC Lyte, Monie Love, Yo-Yo, D-Nice, Rapsody, the Clark Sisters and the very choir her late mother had sung in — had the Kennedy Center audience alternatively swaying in their seats and then giving up chair-dancing altogether as old man rhythm jumped into their shoes.Perhaps the most touching moment of her segment, though, was when Missy Elliott said that as teenager living in what she had always been told was “a man’s world,” there was Latifah, calling herself Queen, and unapologetically insisting on “Ladies First.”Music continued to dominate as the evening wore down, especially in the tribute to Fleming.“Your sonic DNA lives inside of me,” said actor and singer Tituss Burgess, who joined actress Christine Baranski and mezzo-soprano Susan Graham in a rendition of “You’ll Never Walk Alone” from “Carousel,” in which Fleming made her Broadway debut in 2018.Singer and actress Dove Cameron, who played Fleming’s daughter in a London production of “The Light in the Piazza,” performed the musical’s title track and said she’s “never not astounded by the quality of human that Renée is.”Closing out the evening was the tribute to Gibb, which kicked off with a star-studded video with the likes of Dolly Parton, Lionel Richie, Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney.The band Little Big Town had the audience clapping along to the Bee Gees’ “Lonely Days.” Singer Michael Buble complimented Gibb’s famously luxurious hair and sang his dreamy version of “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart,” the song that helped launch Buble’s career. Broadway star and singer Ben Platt performed a funky “Nights on Broadway.”And if the energy had begun to wane — (it hadn’t) — actress and singer Ariana DeBose fed the crowd one last uncut jolt with a raucous medley of Gibb’s biggest hits, ending in a hurricane of confetti.“Stayin’ Alive,” indeed.All that giddiness really began at a Saturday night dinner at the State Department, where the honorees received their medallions.The evening included the usual sweet platitudes about the power and importance of art. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed how the performing arts bind humanity. “We could use more connection, we could use more empathy, we could use more understanding in the world around us,” he said. David Rubenstein, chairman of the Kennedy Center, later added, “Art is not a form propaganda. Art is a from of truth.”Moreno took emceeing to a new level, telling Crystal that his medallion was crooked (“Just like this town, sometimes,” he replied), flirting with Gibb (“You sexy creature,” she yelled), and occasionally (and proudly) going fully off-script.Fleming sang “Happy Birthday” to novelist Ann Patchett, who was toasting her. Gibb assured the audience that he’s not a bow-tie guy and that that thing was coming off ASAP. Latifah began her speech by saying, “Hey, Rob Reiner!”Crystal teared up. Warwick teared up. Latifah teared up. Moreno teared up.Let’s save some time: Pretty much everyone with working tear ducts who spoke teared up.Even giddy weekends need a dash of earnestness.Emily Yahr contributed to this report.",6969,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2023/12/03/kennedy-center-honors-2023/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,flirt propaganda birthday washington giddy doug center lionel warwick read guy fed earn quality happy big room celebrate fully musical business patchett f empathy mickey past stand rapsody offbeat moan asap jill emhoff daughter live human band lady especially compose debose leno creator character cameron tear toast impersonates funky introduce actress ovation billy call back secretary hit analyze front make michael ryan leader power dominate sing moment unapologetically rendition laughter air video unplanned touch pioneer snl barbra teenager save schumer sway charles onstage pretty song elect ribbed ann dna version friend harry rubenstein weekend choir country usual continued dedicate announce give unscripted enthusiastically pelosi novelist knight christine music dreamy dinner gently costa lonely duet replica twinkle connection point nancy chairman sung script creative compliment antony entire contribute life titus york memorably run affair kennedy creature queen biden singer halfway spoke politico understandably segment bit honoree dolly begin president present menu inside living heart sweet time ego stately join assure alfie blinken late world chaotic mc vein buble amuse work overhead level yahr idea wane hand comedian part couple crooked understand rest production paul father track tremendous jumped giddiness platitude star sally speech bomb piazza fleming cover deli spontaneous graham enthusiast word clark walk audience missy reply majority career favorite yell hurricane orgasm bob state project susan city perform wore instead barry department burgess line roar famously lovely smile carousel different bee erivo sister place alive nervous wave dash altogether closing hamilton piece charge perfect speaker rhythm crowd repeatedly robert herbie fake alternatively hey aunt scene gibb clap medley duct elliott stayin latifah receive boom family soprano occasionally rehearse broken year minute pumped broadway streisand platt partner feature art gee light importance reiner form katz proudly energy mother add monie opera elevate guyton love cousin jay report melody gladys renée richie saturday vanvan sunday surprised biographical night dionne teleprompter rapper skit sonic astound raucous niro swayed played gentleman david rob anniversary bind town tweeter boring thrust tribute equalizer crystal lose senate emcee uncut show improvise respond lyte seat debut kick parton hair mend age actor uncle ariana moreno sexy nwodim launch performance laugh legendary house include told medallion baranski honor luxurious humanity title former miranda spinner meant paper cynthia insist london jolt discuss,0.99785,0.2152389151958674,7.881985815602832,0.4514640452140452,0,2023-12-03

CNN,‘You’re Losing Me’ by Taylor Swift can apparently save your life,2023-12-03 17:26:00,Alli Rosenbloom,"Taylor Swift and Beyoncé’s music is good for the heart in more ways than one.Swift’s “You’re Losing Me” and Beyoncé’s “Virgo’s Groove” both have the “right tempo” for hands-only CPR and could be “heart-saving,” according to recent tweets by the American Heart Association.“Hands-Only CPR has just 2 steps: If you see a teen or adult collapse, call 911 and push hard & fast at 100-120 beats per minute,” the American Heart Association wrote on X (formerly Twitter) in a tweet on Saturday about the 2022 Beyoncé track.Both songs have between 100 and 120 beats per minute, which is the speed in which chest compressions should be performed, so humming or singing “You’re Losing Me” or “Virgo’s Grove” can help you stay on tempo in a life-saving measure.You can also hum or sing any song on this playlist created by the American Heart Association to help educate people on rhythms that can save a life during hands-only CPR.Beyoncé’s “Break My Soul” and Swift’s “Welcome to New York” and “Sparks Fly” also appear to have been recently added to the playlist.Lady Gaga’s “Poker Face” or “Just Dance,” “Uptown Funk” by Bruno Mars, Janet Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation,” Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” and the Bee Gees “Stayin’ Alive,” among many other songs, also have the right tempo for performing CPR.To perform hands-only CPR, put the heel of one hand on the breastbone of a collapsed man, woman or teen, put the other hand on top of the first and begin to press down hard and fast at 100 to 120 beats per minute.

USA TODAY,"Julianna Margulies apologizes for statements about Black, LGBTQ+ solidarity with Palestinians",2023-12-03 16:19:38,Naledi Ushe,"Julianna Margulies has apologized for her comments linking a perceived lack of support for Jewish people to Black and LGBTQ+ communities' support of Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war. ""I am horrified by the fact that statements I made on a recent podcast offended the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities, communities I truly love and respect,"" Margulies said in a statement to Deadline and The Washington Post over the weekend. “I want to be 100% clear: Racism, homophobia, sexism, or any prejudice against anyone’s personal beliefs or identity are abhorrent to me, full stop."" She added: ""Throughout my career I have worked tirelessly to combat hate of all kinds, end antisemitism, speak out against terrorist groups like Hamas, and forge a united front against discrimination. I did not intend for my words to sow further division, for which I am sincerely apologetic."" USA TODAY has reached out to reps for Margulies for comment. On the Nov. 20 episode of ""The Back Room with Andy Ostroy"" podcast, Margulies, who is Jewish, said she did not feel groups she and others had supported in the past reciprocated after Hamas' attack on Oct. 7. The actress cited her support for Black communities following the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and her previous participation in a same-sex marriage campaign with her husband Keith Lieberthal in 2011. More than 13,300 Palestinians have been killed since the war broke out nearly two months ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. About 1,200 Israelis have been killed, mostly civilians during Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel. ""The fact that the entire Black community isn’t standing with us, to me, says either they just don’t know or they’ve been brainwashed to hate Jews,"" she said on the podcast, adding, ""In the civil rights movement, the Jews were the ones that walked side by side with the Blacks to fight for their rights."" She said a ""Black lesbian club"" at Columbia University ""put signs up that said, ‘No Jews allowed,'"" for a recent movie screening. ""As someone who plays a lesbian journalist on 'The Morning Show,' I am more offended by it as a lesbian than I am as a Jew."" Speaking of the club, Margulies said she wanted to call them ""idiots,"" continuing, ""You don’t exist. You’re even lower than the Jews. A. You’re Black, and B. You’re gay and you’re turning your back against the people who support you?"" According to the university's student newspaper The Columbia Spectator, there were fliers placed ahead of a screening by the LionLez club that read, ""It’s FREE PALESTINE over here. Zionists aren’t invited."" Margulies added that support for Palestinians among LGBTQ+ people, particularly those who are nonbinary, did not make sense to her. ""It’s those people that will be the first people beheaded and their heads played with like a soccer ball, like a soccer ball on the field. And that’s who they’re supporting? Terrorists who don’t want women to have their rights?"" she said. Her comments led to widespread backlash. Social media users called her them breath-taking, disgusting, racist and condescending. Julianna Margulies: My non-Jewish friends, your silence on antisemitism is loud ""Wish I could say that Julianna Margulies' racist rant against Black people is an outlier. But as I've said before, I've heard this same sentiment from supposedly liberal circles. Solidarity w/ Black people is transactional. We are supposed to be grateful charity recipients,"" Washington Post opinion columnist Karen Attiah, wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Julianna Margulies' rant, not only reinforces racist anti-Arab / Islamophobic tropes, but is also an attempt to remind Black people who stick up for Palestinians of their low place in the racial pecking order. And people still want to claim race has nothing to do with this.""

ABC,"Review: The long Kiss goodbye ends at New York's Madison Square Garden, but Kiss avatars loom",2023-12-03 13:59:00,WAYNE PARRY Associated Press,"NEW YORK -- It's the end of the road for Kiss. But it's not the end of Kiss.The hard-rocking quartet from New York City played final live concerts Friday and Saturday at Madison Square Garden, culminating a half century of rocking and rolling all night and partying every day.And there was a surprise ending. But it wasn't cameo appearances by former members, as many fans had wanted. Instead, in a venture meant to keep Kiss out there — somewhere — forever, Kiss announced at the end of Saturday's final show that the band will live on indefinitely as digitized avatars — to be deployed in ways yet to be revealed.One hint, though: In a promotional video released after the show, Gene Simmons said, “It's gonna be the best concert you've ever seen.” (Presumably for an added fee.)Many Kiss fans said they are not interested in paying to see virtual recreations of the band, including syndicated rock host Eddie Trunk. A lifelong Kiss fan from New Jersey, he has criticized the band in the past for what he considers to be missteps.“I have very little interest in seeing an avatar concert of Kiss, or anyone for that matter,” he said. “It's like going to see a movie. It in no way is a replacement for the live concert experience. There's no live music.”On Facebook, negative comments about the avatars were vastly outnumbering positive ones Sunday.“I couldn’t be more disappointed, disgusted, and shocked at the hideous franken-Kiss they have now created,” wrote Gary Stevens, who portrays Paul Stanley in the Kiss tribute bands Strutter and Kiss Revisited. “Now it makes complete sense why they didn’t want Peter, Ace, Bruce, etc. there to end the era. They would’ve all had to be carried out from laughter had they known what was to come.""That was a reference to the absence of former Kiss band members from the final shows, despite Stanley's repeated statements that he'd be open to former members appearing in some capacity. But the same lingering bad blood regarding original members Ace Frehley and Peter Criss that prevented the band from performing together at their Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame induction kept it from happening again, apparently.The farewell tour was Kiss's second, following one in 2000 with the original four members.The show Friday and Saturday was basically the same one Kiss has been putting on since the latest farewell, dubbed the “End Of The Road” tour. Begun in early 2019, it spanned a good deal of the band's 50-year catalog and featured the sort of special effects that set Kiss apart from its peers since the 1970s.With the possible exception of Alice Cooper's guillotine and snakes, no other band has taken live performances to the extremes Kiss did, particularly in the 1970s. Each band member adopted an onstage persona and developed kabuki-style makeup, studded leather costumes and ridiculously high platform boots, Simmons' taking the form of dragons.He spit blood, breathed fire and flew to the top of the lighting rig. Frehley rigged his Gibson Les Paul guitar to spew smoke and — later — fire rockets at parts of the rigging, one of many things current lead guitarist Tommy Thayer would copy. Stanley rode a circus-style acrobat harness out over the crowd to a satellite stage to sing three songs near the end of the show.Band members were lifted on hydraulic platforms out over the crowd, and the same risers that elevated original drummer Criss toward the arena roof now did the same for current drummer Eric Singer.The show began with the classic Kiss opener “Detroit Rock City” as front-man Stanley, bassist Simmons and Thayer were lowered from the rafters on metallic discs. An enormous roar from the crowd greeted the conclusion of the song Saturday. “Shout It Out Loud” got similar love from the fist-pumping crowd.Stanley, whose voice has been declining over the last decade, nonetheless gave it his all, knowing there was nothing left to hold back for, even though the strain was evident on some notes, and others were delivered through clenched teeth.Throughout the last two shows, Stanley took the temperature of the crowd and tried to channel sadness over the impending finale of the flesh-and-blood Kiss's concert career into a celebration of the past half-century.“So this is the end of the road,” he said Saturday, acknowledging a few stray boos. “I know. It seems sad. But tonight is a night for joy. This is a night to celebrate what we did together. We couldn't have done it without you!”Stanley recalled driving a taxi in New York City in 1972 and dropping people off at Madison Square Garden to see Elvis Presley, telling them that someday, people would be coming there to see him. And he recalled looking out into the crowd at their first Garden show in February 1977 to see his parents, and Simmons' mother.He asked the crowd if they had gotten what they came for, not just on Friday night but for the past 50 years, and paid homage to the band's humble beginnings in the clubs of Queens, a section of New York City.“Rock And Roll All Nite” always closes a Kiss concert, and the usual tsunami of confetti and streamers rained down from the ceiling as Stanley smashed his guitar at the show's climax, the fans raining down love on the band one last time.But then ... fog enshrouded the stage and a video played on a giant screen, revealing the avatars, which looked like something from a video game, promising “a new era begins.”“The end of the road is the beginning of another road!” Stanley said from inside the fog. “We're not going anywhere!

ABC,Beyoncé’s ‘Renaissance’ is No. 1 at the box office with $21 million debut,2023-12-03 11:20:00,LINDSEY BAHR AP film writer,"Beyoncé ruled the box office this weekend.Her concert picture, “ Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” opened in first place with $21 million in North American ticket sales, according to estimates from AMC Theatres Sunday.The post-Thanksgiving, early December box office is notoriously slow, but “Renaissance"" defied the odds. Not accounting for inflation, it's the first time a film has opened over $20 million on this weekend in 20 years (since “The Last Samurai”).Beyoncé wrote, directed and produced “Renaissance,” which is focused on the tour for her Grammy-winning album. It debuted in 2,539 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 94 international territories, where it earned $6.4 million from 2,621 theaters.“On behalf of AMC Theatres Distribution and the entire theatrical industry, we thank Beyoncé for bringing this incredible film directly to her fans,” said Elizabeth Frank, AMC Theatres executive vice president of worldwide programming, in a statement. “To see it resonate with fans and with film critics on a weekend that many in the industry typically neglect is a testament to her immense talent, not just as a performer, but as a producer and director.""Despite several other new releases including “Godzilla Minus One,” the Hindi-language “Animal,"" Angel Studios’ sci-fi thriller “The Shift,"" and Lionsgate’s John Woo-directed revenge pic “Silent Night,"" it was a slow weekend overall. Films in the top 10 are expected to gross only $85 million in total.But it was in this traditional “lull” that AMC Theatres found a good opportunity for “Renaissance” to shine.“They chose a great weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “There was competition but it was from very different kinds of movies.”Though “Renaissance” did not come close to matching the $92.8 million debut of “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” in October, it’s still a very good start for a concert film. No one expected “Renaissance” to match “The Eras Tour,” which is wrapping up its theatrical run soon with over $250 million globally. Prior to Swift, the biggest concert film debuts (titles held by Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber for their 2008 and 2011 films) had not surpassed the unadjusted sum of $32 million.The 39-city, 56-show “Renaissance” tour, which kicked off in Stockholm, Sweden in May and ended in Kansas City, Missouri in the fall, made over $500 million and attracted over 2.7 million concertgoers. Swift’s ongoing “Eras Tour,” with 151 dates, is expected to gross some $1.4 billion.Both Beyoncé and Swift chose to partner with AMC Theatres to distribute their films, as opposed to a traditional studio. Both superstars have been supportive of one another, making splashy appearances at the other’s premieres. Both had previously released films on Netflix (“Miss Americana” and “Homecoming”). And both are reported to be receiving at least 50% of ticket sales.Movie tickets to the show were more expensive than average, around $23.32 versus Swift's $20.78, according to data firm EntTelligence.Critics and audiences gave ""Renaissance"" glowing reviews – it’s sitting at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and got a coveted A+ CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences who were polled. EntTelligence also estimates that the audience, around 900,000 strong, skewed a little older than Swift's.""To have two concert films topping the chart in a single year is pretty unprecedented,” Dergarabedian said.But to compare them too closely would be a mistake.“Taylor Swift was a total outlier and the result of a very specific set of circumstances,” he said. “These two films are similar in genre only. “Lionsgate's “ The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes ” fell to second place in its third weekend with an estimated $14.5 million. The prequel has now earned over $121 million domestically.“ Godzilla Minus One "" took third place on the North American charts with $11 million from 2,308 locations — the biggest opening for a foreign film in the U.S. this year. The well-reviewed Japanese blockbuster distributed by Toho International cost only $15 million to produce and has already earned $23 million in Japan. Toho's 33rd Godzilla film is set in the aftermath of World War II, stars Ryunosuke Kamiki and was directed by Takashi Yamazaki.“This year, we made a concentrated effort to answer the demand of the marketplace and make Godzilla globally accessible across many different platforms,” said Koji Ueda, President of Toho Global, in a statement.“Trolls Band Together” landed in fourth place in its third weekend with $7.6 million, bringing its domestic total to $74.8 million.Fifth place went to Disney’s “Wish,” which fell 62% from its underwhelming first weekend, with $7.4 million from 3,900 locations. Globally, it’s now made $81.6 million. The studio’s other major film in theaters, “The Marvels” is also winding down in its fourth weekend with a disastrous global tally of $197 million against the reported $300 million it cost to make and market the superhero film.In its second weekend, Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” earned an estimated $7.1 million from 3,500 locations. Produced by Apple Original Films and distributed by Sony Pictures, the film starring Joaquin Phoenix has now made $45.7 million domestically against a $200 million budget.Things should pick up in the final weeks of 2023, with films like “Wonka” and “The Color Purple” yet to come. The industry is looking at a $9 billion year — still trailing the $11 billion pre-pandemic norm, but a marked improvement from the last few years. And there are still many solid options for moviegoers, as the industry's awards season gets into full swing.“We had a slow Thanksgiving and we’re having a pretty slow weekend this weekend, but it’s a great weekend to be a moviegoer in terms of the breadth and depth of the movies out there,” Dergarabedian said.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.1. “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” $21 million.2. “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,” $14.5 million.3. “Godzilla Minus One,” $11 million.4. “Trolls Band Together,” $7.6 million.5. “Wish,” $7.4 million.6. “Napoleon,” $7.1 million.7. “Animal,” $6.1 million.8. “The Shift,” $4.4 million.9. “Silent Night,” $3 million.",6327,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/beyoncs-renaissance-1-box-office-21-million-debut-105341212,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5adb687e-2dfa-49cf-befc-94d927d07118/wirestory_9e2b72e87160f89ecf7f3ed248f40433_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,traditional market frank renaissance title attract expensive tally homecoming poll place domestic immense toho netflix premiere cyrus demand snake notoriously night executive great scott bieber start vice analyst underwhelming shift held justin depth ryunosuke specific accounting wrap pick rule game sunday incredible set answer found odds amc glow kamiki original genre moviegoer movie fourth picture theatrical sum outlier japan solid full distribute slow prior big purple lionsgate fell unadjusted swift city joaquin phoenix blockbuster minus worldwide estimate friday covet miley senior give audience write splashy early date ridley ticket disney superstar paul distribution program koji lull foreign december wind fall elizabeth american gross surpass marketplace star taylor ueda kind color global concert superhero film prequel close godzilla kansa oppose appearance marked open beyoncé concentrate strong produce final canadian territory release thanksgiving enttelligence supportive direct expect talent directly debut medium single land breadth result domestically canada match angel entire kick versus similar stockholm platform earn include band review circumstance cost average typically accord major award effort office wonka opening takashi top million competition troll wish behalf theater theatre tomato neglect ongoing director defy international thriller silent ballad unprecedented partner term president critic disastrous apple cinemascore tour revenge john location world week dergarabedian songbird firm comscore album industry missouri billion focus year closely bring sony concertgoers samurai accessible studio option sweden napoleon globally opportunity statement resonate different trail weekend despite chart figure october japanese run previously inflation time chose season norm data performer aftermath testament show compare box americana pretty producer rotten improvement make report miss skewed hunger north animal marvel total receive,0.9824,0.0948316737790422,7.986394984326015,0.387467570045695,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,"We rescued our dog, Archie, three years ago. He’s finally settling in.",2023-12-03 10:00:00,John Kelly,"Time heals wounds. It heals hounds, too.I would not be so rash as to say that our dog, Archie, is cured of all his anxieties, but I will say that he’s in a lot better shape than he was three years ago when we adopted him. Time — plus doggy Prozac — can work wonders.Archie is the big yellow Lab we rescued early in the pandemic. He was 7 then, underweight and heartworm positive. It was easy to diagnose and fix the physical ailments — extra kibble, heartworm shots — but the mental ones were a little tougher to treat.Archie didn’t like being left alone. Hated it. He’d bark nonstop until we got home. He’d climb on the couch and let out a pitiful moan. He’d ransack the kitchen, knocking over the trash can and sweeping the counter for any food unwisely left out.It’s not as if we went out that often. It was the middle of the pandemic, after all. But when we did go out, we’d have to hire someone to be with Archie. Otherwise, he’d practically hyperventilate himself into a seizure.We tried Archie on some medications prescribed by our veterinarian — a maintenance dose of an antidepressant; a tranquilizer if we knew we’d be out and couldn’t find anyone to dog sit — and some “natural” products. We stopped the CBD chews after Archie managed to consume an entire bag of them in a North Carolina Marriott Residence Inn. They didn’t mellow him out at all, and his next few poops were ghastly, smelling like a clogged toilet on the Grateful Dead’s tour bus.But, slowly, things started to change. We tapered him back to just the Prozac. Then my wife, Ruth, landed on a brilliant idea: Copying a Zoom lecture she’d given onto one of those talking picture frames. When we had to go out, we’d walk into the study, shut the door behind us, turn on the tape, then slip out the back door.We’d installed Ring cameras in the house so we could see what Archie would get up to when he was alone. We saw that he’d walk around a bit, then lie down with his butt against the study door, Ruth droning away on the other side.True, we did once neglect to pull the door all the way shut and to our horror we later saw on the Ring camera that he’d pushed it open. There he was, halfway into the study, probably wondering why he could hear Ruth’s voice but not see Ruth.But this turned out not to be the setback we feared. We still turn on that recording and go out that door. Ruth thinks Archie knows she’s not really in there and instead considers this bit of theater a promise that she will be back.And we Archie-proof the house before we go out. The first time a dog knocks over the trash can and eats a greasy bacon wrapper, it’s his fault. The next time, it’s your fault. Now we put the trash can in the powder room and sweep the counters for food.We take Archie with us more often on little errands, too. He likes jumping in the back of the car to pick someone up at the Metro.I wouldn’t say that Archie is 100 percent “normal.” When he’s not sleeping — which is more often these days — he wants to be RIGHT NEXT TO YOU, preferably staring RIGHT INTO your eyes in a slightly unsettling way.But then I don’t know any humans who are 100 percent normal, either. It takes humans awhile to work through their trauma. Why would it be any different for a dog?If I’m being honest, there have been times in the last three years when we’ve questioned the wisdom of adopting Archie — days when neighbors said they heard him bark for four straight hours; days when he ransacked the trash; that eye-watering, cannabidiol-infused dump — but we’re glad we have him.And I think he’s glad he has us, too.From the day it was founded in 1877 right up until today, The Washington Post has been a part of the Washington community.

Washington Post,He lost his wedding ring. A group of strangers showed up to find it.,2023-12-03 08:00:00,Sydney Page,"When Joseph Novetske finished raking leaves in his backyard a few weeks ago, he suddenly stopped as he was walking back toward his house.“I happened to look at my hand. No ring,” said Novetske, 80, who lives in Charlotte, Mich., with his wife, Mary Ann.His handcrafted wedding band — which he wore for 42 years — had slipped off. Worried, he began to look for it.The couple designed the gold wedding band together before they got married in 1981, carefully selecting a cross in the center, and grapevines around it, signifying “the vine of life,"" said Mary Ann Novetske, 71.When he couldn’t find the ring, “I was dispirited,” said Joseph Novetske.The couple searched the yard with no luck. It was toward the end of the day when he realized it was missing, and it was getting dark.“I was feeling pretty desperate,” said Mary Ann Novetske.The following morning on Nov. 5, she posted in a private Facebook group called “What’s happening in Charlotte, Michigan now.” The city has abut 9,200 residents.“Does anyone have a metal detector?” she wrote in a post, explaining what had happened.Shortly after sharing the post, the husband and wife — who have three grown children and five grandchildren — went to church. By the time they got out of the service, Mary Ann Novetske had dozens of responses on her post.“It was people that we didn’t even know that were willing to come and help,"" she said. ""They came right away.”That afternoon, eight people showed up at their home — five of whom were strangers, and the other three were neighbors — to look for the ring. A few of them had brought metal detectors.They searched the large backyard, which Mary Ann Novetske estimates is about the size of half-a-football field. It was filled with several tall piles of leaves her husband had raked the day before.“They didn’t know us, but here they were, willing to help,” said Mary Ann Novetske. “It was exciting to see so many people care about this.”Her husband was also touched.“We love community,” he said. “Obviously, other people do, too.”So the search for the ring began. Together they went through one pile of leaves at a time, and spread out the piles onto a large tarp to make it easier to detect the ring amid the leaves.“Two hours into it, I was convinced we were not going to find this ring,” said Mary Ann Novetske.“There were so many wet leaves, it was like trying to find a needle in a haystack,” said Lisa Delcamp, who lives next door to the Novetskes.But people weren’t giving up.“It was a community hunt,” Delcamp said.Plus, she said, in the process, “I met a lot of nice people.”When the search had hit hour three, the group collectively began working on a pile of leaves at the back of the yard. People who had metal detectors were using them, and the rest were using their eyes and hands.Then Joseph Novetske saw something shiny.“I saw the band reflecting light because it was a beautiful sunny day,” he said. “There it was!”“I was very surprised and thankful,” he added.The searchers were overjoyed.“I just started crying,” said Delcamp.Mary Ann Novetske was also emotional — not only because her husband’s ring was no longer lost, but also because a group of strangers cared enough to spend their Sunday afternoons searching for it. The story was first reported by WLNS 6 News.“I was so astonished that something so little, but something so important to us, would be found,” she said.“We have each other, and we’ll always have that,” she added, but the ring is “still an important symbol.”Admittedly, Joseph Novetske said, the band had been a little loose for a while. After they found the ring, the couple went straight to the jeweler to have it re-sized.“It’s not going anywhere now,” said Mary Ann Novetske.While losing the ring was stressful, and not something they’d recommend to others, the couple said that finding it filled them with hope.",3856,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/12/03/lost-wedding-ring-strangers-michigan/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,wedding haystack stranger lose joseph cross select wet find jeweler desperate wlns nice work brought pile easy reflect admittedly yard service hand band start design post gold excite child wore slip detector eye finish backyard ann dispirit sunday happen hour suddenly hope call worried recommend found searcher husband straight wife neighbor size married stressful mary walk michigan lot private collectively week couple day tall astonish church search city share ring life year rake novetske explain feel estimate vine light sunny story give afternoon thankful ago write signify fill realize longer follow begin needle back beautiful hunt facebook metal dozen stop carefully grapevine center time morning amid convince lisa important tarp hit response group luck grown show grandchild process spread cry abut pretty community charlotte home detect rest field surprised emotional large make report delcamp handcraft miss leaf spend add love loose,0.98865,0.0,6.386795646916564,0.5116047073493882,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,No one really knows how Facebook works. This book might help.,2023-12-03 08:00:00,not specified,"For all the public scrutiny heaped on tech companies in recent years, few people know how Facebook really works. Certainly not lawmakers and, sometimes, not even Facebook itself. The company that shapes the informational diet and worldviews of billions of people is a behemoth of growing complexity, a knotwork of automated systems and carefully constructed algorithms that exist behind a scrim of corporate secrecy. The average observer tends to glimpse Facebook piecemeal, finding a privacy scandal here, intrusive advertising there, perhaps some hate speech in the timeline, all of it forming an incomplete mental image of how the platform operates and why users see what they see.“Broken Code: Inside Facebook and the Fight to Expose Its Harmful Secrets,” the new book by Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Horwitz, tries to give us the whole elephant. An extension of the Facebook Files, a series of prizewinning articles that Horwitz and his colleagues based on more than 20,000 screenshots of Facebook documents from Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager at Facebook before becoming disillusioned, “Broken Code” offers a comprehensive, briskly reported examination of key systems governing the platform and their many failings. Combining Haugen’s access to original sources with interviews with Facebook insiders, Horwitz sets out to demonstrate that Facebook is perhaps less deliberately malevolent and more casually destructive than previously thought — rending the social fabric, funneling its customers into extremist groups, catalyzing political polarization, flooding the infoscape with disinformation, and providing tools that inadvertently facilitate human trafficking and other varieties of exploitation and fraud.According to Horwitz, Facebook has long known what’s wrong with its platform — the company employs a boatload of researchers — but it would rather not know, so reports and memos sometimes get buried. As Horwitz chronicles, a reporting system might be redesigned to simply produce fewer user reports. A request to tweak an algorithm that would reduce the spread of fake news was approved, but Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ordered that its impact should be reduced 80 percent, lest it affect growth or anger power users. Zuckerberg then told the manager who proposed the change, “Don’t bring me something like this again.”“Efforts to engineer growth had inadvertently rewarded political zealotry,” Horwitz writes. “And the company knew far more about the negative effects of social media usage than it let on.”In Horwitz’s telling, Facebook’s leadership suffered from the egoism of the mission-driven corporation, believing that it could do little wrong and that the success of the platform was an inherent good. They were, after all, linking the globe. Their ambitions were utopian — and deeply lucrative. “They had never considered the possibility that it could do harm on the same scale,” Horwitz writes.By the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Facebook, with its sophisticated tools for targeting people according to narrow demographic data and interests, had become a key tool for political campaigns. Facebook offered help to both Donald Trump’s and Hillary Clinton’s campaigns. Only Trump accepted, and so a Facebook staffer went to San Antonio to embed himself in the office from which Brad Parscale directed Trump’s 2016 digital efforts. Facebook’s targeting tools were also credited with aiding in the election of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines and Narendra Modi in India. The company was helping bring authoritarians into office and then becoming, in the eyes of some human rights groups, complicit in their acts of repression.“The truth was that it had no idea what was happening on its platform in most countries,” Horwitz writes. Non-western countries were consigned to the category “Rest of World.” Despite being a dominant communications and broadcast medium in dozens of countries, Facebook often had no native speakers, no policy experts and no real on-the-ground staff in these places. “Most of our integrity systems are less effective outside of the United States,” noted one employee.When Facebook did expand internationally, it hired connected elites and tended to accede to demands from authoritarian governments. In Vietnam, government officials made Facebook more difficult to access after Facebook refused to remove the accounts of some activists. After seven weeks, Facebook capitulated. It was essential to keep Facebook available in Vietnam in any form. The logic applied to Facebook’s efforts to expand into China, for which the company developed censorship tools that would satisfy the government’s strict expectations.Horwitz’s book contains valuable accounts of internal company research and disputes between its various teams — civic integrity, growth, news feed, safety — many of them sincerely motivated to make the best out of a bad hand. There is a culture of internal critique at Facebook — rowdy online staff forums, all-hands meetings where employees can question Zuckerberg — but it has been tamped down in recent years as the company, subject to constant outside attacks and leaks, has strengthened internal security controls. By the time Horwitz met Haugen, who became his key source, “staffers with law enforcement backgrounds [had become] more common.”In Horwitz’s account, Facebook is constantly working to compensate for its own inherent structural flaws. As a force for content distribution and for exciting people’s worst emotional appetites, Facebook is unparalleled. Its libidinal appeal is potentially endless. “It was a Ferrari, a machine designed for one thing: infinite scroll,” says the Facebook employee who was embedded in Trump’s campaign. Indeed, some of Facebook’s most problematic users — the ones who spread colossal amounts of racist content, for example — are those who post obsessively, thousands of times per day. Wary of outright censorship and bad press, the company instead finds ways to suppress the reach of these users’ content or channel their behaviors to less destructive ends. “If people had to be bigots, the company would prefer they be bigots on Facebook,” observes a member of the Integrity team.More than once in this book, a maverick engineer or data scientist is brought in to overhaul a key company system, only to find that their ability to enact substantive change is limited. Growth remains the imperative. And Zuckerberg — a mostly cool, distant figure in Horwitz’s narrative — is sovereign. He welcomes disruption — “move fast and break things” being the company’s infamous longtime motto — but he has interests to protect.Still, the problems are clear, and elemental to Facebook’s nature. The company knows that Instagram, with its endless process of social comparison, produces body image issues in, by its own estimates, a third of teenage girls. People feel worse after using Instagram. Facebook produces similar depressive effects. But what can the company do without blowing up what it has? In response to one proposed set of changes, an employee observed that “the Well Being team was suggesting that Instagram become less like Instagram.”“Broken Code” is light on summary conclusions, and that’s for the best. Too many tech books offer 11 chapters of doom and gloom, diagnosing our dire predicament of mass surveillance and exploitative automated systems, and then follow all that up with one chapter of false solace where everything, in a brushstroke (or maybe a mouse click), is easily solved. Almost a decade ago, I wrote one such book. “Broken Code” is something better. It’s a smartly reported investigation into the messy internal machinations of one of the world’s most important and least understood companies. Horwitz emerges with the company’s dirty secrets but no pat conclusions. That’s left to the reader, who might decide that all of this has to go.Inside Facebook and the Fight to Expose its Harmful SecretsBy Jeff Horwitz",7972,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/12/03/broken-code-facebook-horwitz-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,power briskly worldviews limited digital human inadvertently combine source demonstrate remains india insider dominant excite distant glimpse comprehensive form constantly dire scroll policy reduce logic problematic haugen deliberately overhaul broadcast negative construct corporate journal bigot disillusion fake tool smartly believe impact anger government reporting decade category left communication estimate mouse secret vietnam outright strict feed jeff knew wary social developed decide follow meeting welcome algorithm control growth available leak advertising facebook authoritarian censorship access narendra scrim success fight suffer possibility reward casually exploitative security campaign unparalleled presidential truth rest issue produce accepted libidinal obsessively account click customer expert direct sophisticated disruption move find native secretsby modi work body rend staffer book apply prefer platform tweak hand wrong girl average law speech effort china employee interview contains system effect subject secrecy investigation scientist compensate manager clinton timeline news request staff background accede key speaker reporter maverick machine utopian press false week shape enforcement demographic thousand embed real consider expose ambition valuable enact scale teenage conclusion question satisfy duterte blowing integrity motivate complexity substantive carefully attack scrutiny previously consign internal time provide zealotry important long interest appetite corporation ability constant memo link culture gloom dispute exist racist piecemeal indeed report ferrari clear complicit document funnel observer state instagram engineer easily sincerely user offer bury member effective instead prizewinning structural code govern infoscape brought parscale tend online cool place elite simply rodrigo demand heaped exploitation traffic boatload narrative brushstroke colleague design colossal fabric harmful zuckerberg potentially privacy happen catalyze employ set expand hire propose original strengthen emerges hate harm connect writes research image solace flood scandal behemoth screenshots note infinite san leadership feel difficult light donald give meta ago write act chronicle mass machination rowdy distribution official recent ceo forum behavior diet longtime understood observes motto country team article activist election percent examination group base messy internationally deeply knotwork diagnose street political intrusive emotional aid comparison company elemental problem medium solve sovereign chapter pat trump suggest polarization order dirty horwitz similar lawmaker reader tech incomplete public depressive post tamped accord office eye extension antonio reach informational break malevolent predicament destructive critique told broken brad redesign inside appeal refuse fast world content day researcher variety affect flaw billion imperative elephant year change bring amount force wall france safety remove approve lucrative disinformation narrow united extremist channel essential facilitate suppress infamous egoism despite figure credit dozen endless grow mental file data doom response operates philippine inherent process series spread civic hillary nature observe automate failing surveillance make capitulate product globe target idea mark summary usage,0.1056999999999999,0.1505268439538384,10.546565726083962,0.4626234876234877,0,2023-12-03
ABC,"Kennedy Center Honorees include Queen Latifah, Billy Crystal and Dionne Warwick",2023-12-03 07:35:00,ASHRAF KHALIL Associated Press,"WASHINGTON -- The newest group of Kennedy Center honorees, including comedian Billy Crystal and actor Queen Latifah, are being feted Sunday night at a star-studded event commemorating their lifetime achievement in arts and entertainment.Opera singer Renée Fleming, music star Barry Gibb and prolific hitmaker Dionne Warwick also are being honored at the black-tie gala. Each will receive personalized tributes that typically include appearances and performances that are kept secret from the honorees themselves.In announcing the recipients earlier this year, the Kennedy Center's president, Deborah F. Rutter, called this year’s group of inductees “an extraordinary mix of individuals who have redefined their art forms.”Crystal, 75, came to national prominence in the 1970s playing Jodie Dallas, one of the first openly gay characters on American network television, on the sitcom “Soap.” He went on to a brief but memorable one-year stint on “Saturday Night Live” before starring in a string of movies, including hits such as “When Harry Met Sally... ,” “The Princess Bride” and “City Slickers.”Crystal, who also received the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy in 2007, joins an elite group of comedians cited for both: David Letterman, Steve Martin, Lorne Michaels, Lily Tomlin, Carol Burnett and Neil Simon. Bill Cosby received both honors, but they were rescinded in 2018 following his sexual assault conviction, which later was overturned.Warwick, 82, shot to stardom in the 1960s as the muse for the superstar songwriting team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Her discography includes a multidecade string of hits, both with and without Bacharach, that includes “I Say a Little Prayer,” “I’ll Never Love This Way Again” and “That’s What Friends Are For.”Fleming, 64, is one of the leading sopranos of her era, with a string of accolades that includes a National Medal of Arts bestowed by President Barack Obama, a Cross of the Order of Merit from the German government and honorary membership in England’s Royal Academy of Music.Gibb, 76, achieved global fame as part of one of the most successful bands in the history of modern music, the Bee Gees. Along with his late brothers Robin and Maurice, the trio launched a nearly unmatched string of hits that defined a generation of music.Latifah, 53, has been a star since age 19 when her debut album and hit single “Ladies First” made her the first female crossover rap star. She has gone on to a diverse career that has included seven studio albums, starring roles in multiple television shows and movies and an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her role in the movie musical “Chicago.”",2692,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/kennedy-center-honors-time-crop-including-queen-latifah-105338385,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/46f9a81e-8710-4d54-a7a6-72cd598fa5a2/wirestory_97ecec2a716c9953af2a45275964fc15_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,membership twain stint burt cross fame debut memorable single prolific bee deborah commemorate crossover successful bride soprano prize dallas honorary order harry latifah elite letterman fleming prominence royal jodie earlier night generation unmatched rutter tribute include dionne band renée network billy lifetime typically play barry musical bestow gay muse sunday inductee steve discography sally stardom comedy burnett bill call actor comedian cosby multidecade career michael television extraordinary achievement friend mix carol lead bacharach honor movie national rap crystal gee president england merit german government age album queen city washington chicago define nomination lady event oscar year kennedy obama rescind assault martin barack shot secret conviction neil studio diverse achieve brother fete sitcom maurice trio string follow live superstar announce prayer robin gibb tomlin support recipient medal simon launch american hitmaker songwriting team center sexual part star redefine individual female modern global hit singer group show role actress multiple late music personalize appearance lily openly character history honoree accolade art join saturday make gala david warwick mark performance academy love lorne receive princess,0.99155,0.2228826151560178,9.93129411764706,0.3608843537414966,0,2023-12-03
NPR,Waiting for water: It's everywhere in this Colombian city — except in the pipes,2023-12-03 07:32:00,Ben de la Cruz,"Pointing to a tangle of 1-inch white plastic pipes poking through the weeds and trash beside the dirt road just down the hill from her home, the 36-year-old mom says that this is where the water would flow from the local utility. But there hasn't been a drop for 28 days and counting. July Merino shows how she retrieves water from the alberca in her home. The concrete cistern can store about two weeks of water that her family uses to do laundry, wash dishes and flush the toilet. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption Ana Troncoso, who lives next door to her daughter July, ran out of water the day before. She opens the square steel lid that sits atop the alberca — a concrete cistern just outside her front door. In her neighborhood, none of the homes has indoor plumbing. They store water in a cistern, which can hold about a two-week supply for washing laundry and dishes, bathing and flushing toilets, among other things. Now there's only an inch of water on the algae-mottled bottom of the alberca, just enough to keep the tank from cracking in the 90-plus-degree summer heat, she explains. The alberca outside Ana Troncoso's home is nearly empty — until the next water delivery arrives. There's just enough water at the bottom to keep the cistern from cracking in the summer heat. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption ""I feel bad because we need the water more than electricity. If there's a power outage it's OK,"" says the 60-year-old, whose forehead is already glistening from the morning sun. ""But without water it's bad, really bad."" Ana and July live in La Paz, a low-income neighborhood of 15,000 on the hilly outskirts of Santa Marta, a coastal city whose beaches and parks have made it a top tourist destination in Colombia. In the best of times, residents of La Paz gather water from the pipes in the streets once every two weeks to store in their cisterns. But July says that five years ago, the water company began providing water only once a month to her block. July, left, recalls gathering water from a nearby creek when she was a child, along with her mother Ana, right. July says the access to water isn't much better since water delivery in their section of La Paz was cut from twice a month to once a month. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption They're among the 4 billion or so people — roughly half of the world's population — who experience severe water scarcity for at least part of the year. The water issue in La Paz is a citywide problem. The city's two water treatment facilities can pump out only around 25% of what the city needs, according to engineering professor Juan Guillermo Saldarriaga, a water expert at Los Andes University in Bogotá, Colombia. Residents have installed 1-inch plastic pipes to tap into the main water pipeline that runs under the streets of La Paz. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption ""Leaks in the system. That's one big problem. You treat water and put it into pipes and it just leaks to the ground,"" says Saldarriaga. ""Your infrastructure is getting older there and then you have more people to feed [the water to]. And so that's why the problem is becoming worse every year that passes."" The population of Santa Marta has more than doubled in the last 30 years to about 550,000, swelled recently by an influx of immigrants from Venezuela. Colombians from small towns looking for jobs and fleeing security issues created by drug trafficking have also been moving to the city. La Paz sits on the hilly outskirts of downtown Santa Marta, Colombia. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption ""Nearby we have an invasión with approximately 800 land lots, which means 800 families, with an average of five people per family, which means 4,000 new people in this community. Most of these people are Venezuelans,"" explains Carlos Ramos, a 26-year-old community leader who has lived in La Paz all his life and aspires to be a neighborhood representative in the city government of Santa Marta. Invasión is the term Colombians use to describe an area where people settle illegally. ""The more people come here, the less water we have for everyone because we have to share it,"" Ramos adds. When Ana Troncoso moved here with her family more than 30 years ago, in 1991, the neighborhood was still an invasión. There were only three houses near her home in La Paz at the time. Community leaders Nelinton Guerrero, left, Carlos Ramos, center, and Aníbal Ruda work with the water utility to improve water distribution for La Paz's 15,000 residents. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption Her daughter July recalls fetching water from a creek on the mountainside with her mother when July was a little girl. They carried water back to their house in jugs strapped to a donkey. The situation today is not that much better. Jose de la Vega Gonzalez of La Paz finally received water in his pipes the day he met with an NPR reporter. He said he hadn't received any water for several months. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption ""People keep saying, 'I've run out of water today. I'm parched. I don't have any water at home to take a shower. I don't have water at home to cook. I don't have any money to buy it.' Those are the cries for help that we hear as community leaders,"" says Ramos. ""It's terrible. It makes you notice the societal backwardness and the delay in infrastructure improvements."" City officials did not respond to NPR's repeated requests for an interview. Community leader Carlos Ramos stands by one of the major water connection points in La Paz, where residents hook up their motor pumps to push water from the main pipe through their hoses into their home cisterns hundreds of feet away. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption To get water from the pipes in the street to people's homes, residents have improvised a relatively inexpensive solution. Ramos asks us to follow him down the dirt road about a two-minute walk from where he lives to show us their makeshift system. We stop at a barbed wire fence, where 10 hoses are strewn amid the rocks. Electrical outlets hang precariously from the top of a tall wooden post nearby. This is one of the major water collection points for the neighborhood. Ramos explains that 40 to 50 people typically gather here each month, sharing the connections for their small motor pumps that push the water from the main pipe through their hoses into their albercas hundreds of feet away. An electric motor pump is essential to push water from the utility's pipes to private homes in La Paz. A community leader says residents began using pumps for this purpose some 30 years ago. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption The water typically comes in fits and starts that last 15-20 minutes — if at all. Family members take shifts plugging and unplugging their motor pumps into the electrical outlets that they've run from their homes so the motors don't burn out when the water stops. They work methodically, careful not to splash water on the outlets so they don't electrocute themselves. It's a laborious and not especially safe solution, but it's the best option for a community where money is tight. Most of the people work in the informal sector, el rebusque (the hustle) as they say in Colombia, doing odd jobs like peddling souvenirs to tourists or painting houses to make ends meet. ""It's outrageous when we see our elders in our community, staying up all night, in the streets,"" Ramos says. ""Sometimes wasting that night because the water didn't even come and then having to get ready to go to work in the morning."" Across the city, water rationing is part of daily life in Santa Marta. You can only expect to get water by turning on your faucet in wealthier neighborhoods and tourist areas with restaurants and hotels. They pay the highest rates for water. The price for water in places like La Paz, on the other hand, is heavily subsidized by the city. Ironically, this takes away the monetary incentive for the water company to better service the area, says Saldarriaga. Santa Marta has running water only in wealthier neighborhoods and in restaurants and hotels in its tourist center. These water customers pay the highest rates. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption What is especially galling to people in Santa Marta is that they know their city is rich with freshwater resources. The Spaniards chose this coastal area to establish their first settlement in Colombia in 1525 for this reason, christening it ""The Pearl of America."" More than 30 rivers flow in and around the city from the snowy caps of the Sierra Nevada, one of the highest coastal ranges in the world. Some rivers weave through the neighborhoods, bending around parks and running behind shops before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Water is everywhere, except in the pipes. 1 of 6 And even when water is available, residents in La Paz are leery about drinking it. Those who can afford it buy bagged water or bottled water for drinking, Ramos says. July says her family buys drinking water almost every day. It's a significant expense for herself, her husband and their three children. July works as a pool attendant at the Marriott Hotel, earning the minimum wage of around 1.2 million pesos per month — about $250. As a building maintenance man, her husband makes a little more plus bonuses. July prepares breakfast for her 6-year-old son Samuel. She and her husband spend a significant amount of their monthly income to purchasing water for drinking. The white container by her side holds water for washing dishes. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption Five years ago, when the water company began supplying water rations only once a month instead of every two weeks, July says her family's quality of life and finances were affected. It meant they would get only half the water they used to receive for daily needs. As the family nears the end of the month and the water in their alberca starts to run low, they go into emergency mode. July showers at work. The family reuses bathwater to flush the toilet. They borrow water from family and neighbors. They buy legumes instead of meat at the grocery store to save their money to get water from other sources. A water tank truck is a fairly reliable but expensive alternative to the water pipes in La Paz. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption A few months ago, when the water didn't come on time and no one they knew had water to spare, July's family called Ramos as a last resort. He arranged for a water tank delivery, a fairly reliable but expensive alternative to the water pipes in La Paz. One water tank delivery costs about 150,000 pesos — about $37. That's more than half a week's wages for a minimum wage worker like July. ""Water is the most important for us, but we shouldn't have to choose, so we are sacrificing other things for our family. We sacrifice buying things for our house, so we can get water,"" says Ramos. Residents are frustrated that they can't get officials from the city or water company to move more quickly to improve the water distribution in La Paz after so many years of promises. Daniel Palmera (right) points to a pipe in the ground where he and Camilo Castillo tried to set up their motor pump. But on that morning, no more water was available. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption ""We decided that if the water company doesn't answer, then the citizens, for example, will block the roads,"" explains Ramos. ""We, as leaders, have stopped the community from doing it, because we have told them that we are going to keep on dialoguing, trying to improve the water situation."" In the last few months, talks with the municipal water company have been more productive. The company installed new equipment at three connection points in one sector of La Paz. That enables more residents to connect to the main water pipes for twice a month delivery, according to Nelinton Humberto Guerrero Pelaez, a community leader. Guerrero says that a water company official also met with the community last month to listen to their concerns. ""We have to keep on pushing to get our precious liquid. That's what we want, for God to bless us, so we can have the service 24/7,"" he says. The water company recently installed new equipment that enables residents of La Paz to more easily connect to the main water pipes. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption Whether the city will commit to spending the money to upgrade the water distribution for the entire community and the entirety of Santa Marta is an open question. Professor Saldarriaga's research group had presented a plan to improve the water system that, if implemented, would have solved the city's major water problems two years ago, he says. But city officials never acted on it. ""It's a surprise that they haven't started anything. I mean, they haven't laid just a single brick in the town to solve this problem,"" he says. La Paz resident Isaac Campo shows community leader Carlos Ramos that his alberca is almost empty. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption ""This is Macondo,"" says Saldarriaga, referring to the city in the magical realism novel One Hundred Years of Solitude by Colombian Gabriel García Márquez. ""Anything as crazy as you can imagine happens in Macondo — anything — that's Santa Marta. Santa Marta is the modern Macondo."" The latest city plan to fix the water issues in Santa Marta is expected to start in 2024, Ramos says. But he remains skeptical, like other residents, that the city will follow through. And with the mayoral election in October still unresolved, it's unclear whether a new administration will have the same priorities. Carlos Ramos is among five community leaders in La Paz who have been working to fix long-standing water issues in La Paz. He aspires to represent the neighborhood in the city government. Ben de la Cruz/NPR hide caption Even if the city followed through on the plan, Ramos say it would take at least four to five years to complete the improvements to the water system. ""Today we have hope that maybe in five years we can have improvements in the water issues,"" Ramos says. ""How can we wait for so long when water is such a vital need?"" ""What we all really want is them giving us water twice a week. That would help us a lot,"" says July, who's still not on a monthly delivery schedule. ""We wouldn't have to think about it too much because waiting is exhausting.""",14235,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/12/03/1216561130/colombia-water-scarcity,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/12/01/44_359a5793_custom-6fb77009275278030c1766e500829884844e4599-s1100-c50.jpg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,meat troncoso traffic venezuelan knew center flush venezuela park bottom ramos palmera morning listen population feel inexpensive daughter finally aspires citizen carry put sacrifice especially tight top supply pearl trash answer utility call back october push fix leader official sierra makeshift meet neighbor merino engineering outskirt expect save delay marriott rebusque gather maintenance hill skeptical nearby legume tangle santa hold instal cap give grocery company atop infrastructure reason notice alberca connection upgrade aníbal week land remains long quickly incentive coastal set entire amid system million beach campo concrete street government today bless begin present laid peso careful wait freshwater god problem castillo treat imagine mountainside snowy attendant talk work easily asks schedule faucet community surprise relatively leak part repeat hose prepares accord nevada peddle laborious ana splash modern caption odd walk stop electrocute terrible local bathing distribution monetary recently donkey instead npr group explains dish equipment bathwater liquid weed complete affected away vega facility refer laundry security turn downtown wash improvement hang july hundred home spend tall receive electric girl pay family tap term daniel year wealthier bogotá option major jug saldarriaga destination represent interview amount arrange sun ruda mother collection block barbed realism márquez cook wire pass guerrero cry worker backwardness available typically resort camilo job plug buying promise drinking indoor tank waste methodically experience spaniard town source bending afford poke rich river representative choose minimum reliable steel parch truck pipeline flee electrical delivery forehead influx election meant strap elder municipal burn mom child fairly electricity concern outage water request inch paz wooden colombian fetch earn quality big precariously cost pipe productive stand solve act container research plastic humberto ran plumbing live approximately monthly shop foot borrow money share chose creek bottle front swell make breakfast scarcity power establish empty carlos single improve service income heavily christen member unresolved half access severe exhaust situation high enables precious commit societal heat garcía left cut glisten side treatment small connect bonus outlet juan strewn plan point retrieves marta life rate weave tourist run colombia day dialoguing gabriel expensive sits start drop jose hide guillermo hook ration dirt store administration time provide ago late world souvenir flow lot alternative crack feed hand ironically range wage buy isaac andes resource expert fence gathering gonzalez resident post pelaez unplug entirety question crazy issue building leery samuel average improvised frustrate stay city decide ready nears implement pool informal reporter place settle expense bag counting square macondo neighborhood immigrant cistern outrageous illegally rock solution double motor minute brick finance husband spending mayoral move hustle private arrives subsidize area add roughly safe sector america lid describe unclear significant low solitude night shower albercas painting road customer hear price magical settlement white purpose create month show hope respond pump purchasing nelinton caribbean essential follow priority gall section emergency summer university house reuses fit open important told professor ground spare toilet citywide vital hilly shift daily invasión restaurant recall billion,0.964,0.0632244467860906,7.105805545805545,0.4435722177128431,0,2023-12-03
NPR,Feeling alone? 5 tips to create connection and combat loneliness,2023-12-03 07:00:00,Allison Aubrey,"Dr. Jeremy Nobel's new book, Project UnLonely, offers a road map for making social connections. Photo © Avery (HC)/Penguin Random House hide caption Many factors can increase vulnerability to loneliness, including trauma, sickness or being part of a marginalized group. The bent toward individualism and independence, woven into U.S. culture, may play a role too. The mindset of pull yourself up by your own bootstraps and fend-for-yourself autonomy, ""it is part of the American psyche,"" Nobel says. Of course, it's possible to be both independent and socially connected, but in recent decades, as societal norms have changed, there are countervailing forces that may make some people more susceptible to loneliness. ""A hundred years ago, your identity was almost fully defined by your gender, your religion and your status,"" Nobel says, and there wasn't much flexibility to alter it. Now, people have more freedom to chart their own course and create their own identities. ""It's both a set of opportunities and a set of challenges,"" he says, since the process of determining who you are and where you fit in can be disorienting or confusing. When there's not a prescribed way to ""belong,"" finding connection can be tough. Many people are hesitant to put themselves out there, or they have a hard time communicating what's on their minds. ""This is where the arts can be very powerful because they act as a catalyst to make it easier,"" Nobel says. Drawing a picture may seem like a solitary act, but it can be a bridge to connection, a way to express what's on your mind. Nobel is a poet. ""I feel like I'm in a conversation with a reader I'm imagining when I write a poem,"" he says. It's one of the art forms that helped him overcome the trauma and loneliness he experienced as a teenager after his father's death and as a young adult after the death of two close friends. As a believer in the medicinal power of creative expression, he founded the Foundation for Art & Healing about 20 years ago. Some of his earliest work was with active-duty service members and veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress. They gathered in small groups to engage in artistic expression and mindfulness activities. At this point, Nobel's main focus was helping people deal with trauma. ""People began telling us that not only were they less stressed out, but they felt more connected to each other, something I later realized was addressing a certain kind of loneliness,"" Nobel says. Dr. Jeremy Nobel started the Foundation for Art & Healing, which uses creative expression to combat stress, anxiety and loneliness. Brian Smith/Penguin Random House hide caption Dr. Jeremy Nobel started the Foundation for Art & Healing, which uses creative expression to combat stress, anxiety and loneliness. Project UnLonely now partners with community-based organizations to develop evidence-based creative expression programs, which can include music, painting, drawing and beyond. Nobel says the options are endless. ""Culinary arts is a big one,"" he says. Many people find creative expression through cooking and baking. There are also textile arts such as knitting, crocheting or quilting. Even gardening is a form of artistic expression. ""It's what a friend of mine calls the world's slowest performance art form,"" Nobel says. Research shows making art or even viewing the work of other people reduces levels of the stress hormone cortisol. It also increases levels of the feel-good hormones, including dopamine, endorphins and oxytocin. ""So what the arts do is they relax you and put you in a good mood,"" Nobel says, which can help create an inviting vibe to connect. One of the goals of Project UnLonely is to encourage people to get started on their own. Here are some tips to get going. It's easier to connect with people if you have shared interests or experiences, so start paying attention to what's on your mind. What are you thinking about? What motivates you? What excites you? Nobel says knowing yourself can be a first step to bonding with others. ""I think connecting authentically with other people is best done — and perhaps only done — if you have some kind of authentic connection with yourself,"" Nobel says. If you know what's meaningful or fun for you, it may lead you to an activity or creative outlet that connects you to people who share your interests. ""When we say make something, people immediately say, 'Well, I'm not Picasso. I don't know how to do a fancy painting,'"" Nobel says. And, of course, you're not! But the opportunities for creative expression are endless. ""Do a doodle [or] a dance move,"" Nobel suggests. Resurrect your grandma's pie recipe, plant an herb garden, try a textile art. ""Make something that puts your thoughts and feelings and vision about who you are and what matters into a tangible artifact that then can express those thoughts and feelings to others,"" he says. ""Share something about yourself,"" Nobel says. ""It doesn't have to be the biggest, darkest secret of your life, but just something you think other people might find interesting and compelling, and see where it goes."" Even if you're nervous about being judged or dismissed, putting yourself out there requires a bit of a risk, and it's the first step to authentic connection. If you've made something — say your doodle or dance move or pie — this can be a catalyst to sharing. Simply explaining what you've made may make it easier to open up about who you are. Whether it's volunteering for a cause you believe in or playing frisbee or Scrabble, try to find others who share your interests. And if you follow your natural curiosities, you may find something new. In his book, Nobel describes an online group that has a quirky shared interest: a fascination with brown bears in Alaska, which led to Fat Bear Week. ""Share your thoughts and feelings in creative ways with other people who have that interest,"" he says. And, hopefully, in those interactions you can begin to reveal yourself and share the unique things that matter to you. ""Then, other people recognize that, share their story in return, and it's like an electric circuit is connected,"" he says. Loneliness can spiral. If the pangs of loneliness go unaddressed, people can end up in a world of hurt. ""If you see someone who's experiencing loneliness, tolerate the risk of asking them how they're doing,"" Nobel says. Be kind. Be willing to share something about your own experiences of loneliness, and take that risk. ""Other people's loneliness makes us lonely too,"" he says.

Washington Post,Why your mood could affect your flu shot,2023-12-03 07:00:00,not specified,"Silly cat videos could be good for your health — at least if you are about to get one of the seasonal vaccines.For instance, when people who were in a positive mood got a flu shot that day, they produced higher levels of antibodies to help them fight the disease, according to one British study.This data on mood and vaccines is limited, but a substantial body of research shows many other lifestyle factors — such as diet, exercise and even social interactions — may affect how much protection people get from vaccines, including, it appears covid-19 jabs.Scientists are still trying to determine how higher antibody counts translate into disease protection in real life: After all, there are other parts of the immune system, such as T-cells, that play an important role in keeping us healthy, too. Yet for now, antibody levels are a common measurement used by scientists trying to determine vaccine efficacy, and “that is generally a correlate of protection,” says Marian Kohut, an immunobiologist at the Iowa State University.Not all people respond to vaccines in the same way. Some develop better antibody protection than others, while immunization may fail for an unlucky few.“The response induced by a vaccine can vary tremendously between individuals,” says Bali Pulendran, an immunologist at Stanford University. Age is part of the reason, he says, with older people generally responding less effectively than younger ones.Genetics also play a role. Studies of twins show that for some vaccines, such as measles, almost 90 percent of the variation in antibody response is due to our genes (for other vaccines, these numbers are lower — for mumps, for instance, the variation in antibody response due to genes is 39 percent).Yet even if you are older and didn’t win the genetic lottery, you can still improve your chances of a good vaccine response, experts say.“Sleep is a biggie,” says Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, professor emeritus in psychiatry at Ohio State University’s College of Medicine whose research has focused on how stress and depression can alter our immune and endocrine systems. “When you’re not sleeping, you’re [impairing] your immune response.”A 2023 meta-analysis of studies showed that sleeping fewer than six hours a night can hamper the immune system’s response to various vaccines.In one experiment, where volunteers would sleep a mere four hours a night over a period of six days before vaccination, those who were sleep-deprived had only half the antibody response to their influenza vaccine 10 days after the jab compared with people who were allowed to sleep as much as they wished.This is why Kiecolt-Glaser recommends “getting enough sleep, especially the night before, a couple of nights before ideally, and then getting enough sleep after the vaccine.”Diet is important, too.Research shows that a healthy gut microbiota plays a significant role in how well we respond to vaccination. In one 2023 study, among people receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, those who had a larger abundance of a beneficial gut bacteria associated with the eating of the Mediterranean diet — called Bifidobacterium adolescentis — maintained their vaccine protection longer, even six months after their second dose. Other research also found links between microbes that are known to keep the gut healthy and a better response to cholera vaccine and tetanus vaccine.Antibiotics, meanwhile, can deplete the gut microbiome, potentially disturbing our immune response to vaccination — as Pulendran and his colleagues found in their 2019 study.Taking antibiotics for five days “resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in the bacteria in the gut,” he says. As a result, “people who got antibiotics had much, much lower antibody response to the flu vaccine than the control people.”For Pulendran, such diminished efficacy of vaccines is “yet another reason” we shouldn’t prescribe antibiotics indiscriminately.The good news is that probiotics seem to enhance the microbiome, including Bifidobacterium adolescentis, boosting the levels of antibodies produced after immunization. In one flu study, for example, taking Lactobacillus probiotics twice a day for 28 days after vaccination significantly increased the levels of antibodies. In mice, a Lactobacillus supplement helped the rodents’ immune response after a covid shot — although it’s worth noting that results in mice don’t always translate into humans.Pulendran warns that such research doesn’t mean you should rush to the nearest store to stock up on probiotics.“There is this bewildering array of different products,” he says, which have not been evaluated by science and are of mixed quality. This makes it difficult to assess what might boost the effectiveness of a particular vaccine.Instead, Pulendran says, people should work on our healthy gut microbiome in the long term by eating plenty of fiber, while avoiding processed foods and added sugars.In addition to sleep and diet, physical exercise appears to improve vaccine response in many people. Kiecolt-Glaser says this is why she tries to time her workouts for just before her annual flu and covid shots.A 2022 meta-analysis suggests that a short bout of exercise right before or immediately after immunization can increase the efficacy of flu vaccines, especially in older adults.Exercising the arm in which you get the jab might be particularly beneficial — doing biceps curls, for example, says Kohut, whose research focuses on factors that affect the immune response to viral infection or vaccines. These kinds of “muscle damaging types of exercise done in the muscle where the vaccine is being administered would induce inflammation — and having higher inflammation could improve immune response to the vaccine,” she says.Exercise also may diminish side effects that some people experience after vaccination, such as swelling at the jab site, or fever, according to a 2018 study. And even going for a brisk walk, lasting 45 to 90 minutes, after the shot may boost the antibody response, Kohut says her research suggests.There are several theories why exercise may improve immune function, Kohut says, such as muscle-secreted proteins that influence the immune response and exercise-induced changes in the production of metabolites — chemical compounds that the body generates during metabolism.Yet, she admits, scientists still don’t fully understand the mechanisms linking exercise and vaccine efficacy.As with diet, research suggests making exercise a permanent and regular feature in your life is probably the most effective way to boost your antibody response to a vaccine.A large 2023 study of health-care workers showed that for regular exercisers, coronavirus vaccines were over 85 percent effective in preventing hospital admissions. But in sedentary people — those engaging in less than 60 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week — immunization was just 60 percent effective. (One caveat — regular exercisers may have had better diets or sleep.)Exercise aside, if you are having a particularly stressful couple of days, Kiecolt-Glaser says, you may want to avoid scheduling vaccinations at that particular time, especially if you are not young.“The older a person is, the more stress matters” for the efficacy of vaccines, she says.Kiecolt-Glaser’s research on seniors (mean age 73) caring for a spouse with dementia showed that only 38 percent developed an antibody response to the influenza vaccine, compared with 66 percent of those in the same age group who were not caregivers.Strong social connectedness tends to boost how well we react to vaccines, studies have found.In one report, first-year university students — who were vaccinated against the flu and could name at least 13 close friends or family members with whom they met frequently — produced significantly more antibodies after the jab than peers who reported fewer close contacts.Similar effects have been found in studies involving the pneumococcal vaccine and covid shots — people with better social networks appear to have a stronger antibody response than those who were lonelier or had few connections.It may be a little late in this winter’s vaccine cycle to focus on addressing loneliness, nurturing relationships with neighbors or modifying your gut microbiota. But ensuring a good night’s sleep, sidestepping vaccinations on high-stress days and taking a brisk walk post-jab could all be advantageous.",8444,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/12/03/vaccines-diet-exercise-attitude/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AY5B7QGNAMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AY5B7QGNAMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AY5B7QGNAMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AY5B7QGNAMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AY5B7QGNAMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AY5B7QGNAMI6VGNQQQTOE3JAHM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,efficacy muscle nurture microbiome limited member hamper effective sleep function store disturb prevent improve admission abundance protection immune bacteria tetanus recommends night develop array colleague quality react rodent mood immunization british tremendously coronavirus rush impair biggie experiment ideally measles potentially period immunologist boost student stock healthy mixed found activity dose influenza minute lonelier vaccine family translate antibody genetic seasonal swell pneumococcal stressful research particularly walk prescribe positive health fever depression determine effectiveness deplete winter chemical involve note ensure mouse food ohio university difficult person viral exerciser senior eat fiber social significantly janice developed longer substantial regular control correlate vaccination infection annual microbiota matter receive protein low diet study supplement significant type sidestep marian mechanism unlucky chance part percent kind count fight especially antibiotic group beneficial sedentary close arm inflammation strong gene biceps large iowa produce vary add flu connectedness expert science metabolite due site factor frequently curl generally instance influence understand warns bali number result lactobacillus work half body disease administer modify lifestyle addition hospital exercise moderate reason bewildering short include suggests interaction variation caveat probably worth admits network generates common immunobiologist high play accord particular brisk advantageous evaluate peer gut bout probiotic vaccinate system effect hour call cycle bifidobacterium fully level scientist microbe college mediterranean permanent cholera friend news address stanford volunteer neighbor effectively term diminish enhance workout twin increase plenty fail week couple day age alter side induce month affect young physical real life induced lottery intensity medicine focus respond change feature production emeritus win shot covid avoid ass pulendran associate immediately schedule kohut different engage compound psychiatry relationship silly worker adolescentis damage experience video spouse endocrine time individual important data loneliness long response stress show dementia role professor late process compare link maintain mumps measurement reduction make report theory product state,0.98555,0.1421127427759355,12.125452091767883,0.4532662028237252,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,"Your hair care routine might carry health risks, this study says",2023-12-03 06:00:00,not specified,"The products that produce shiny, frizz-free hair emit high levels of substances that could endanger human health, research published last month concludes — and heated styling tools may make the problem worse.Published in Environmental Science & Technology, the analysis focused on compounds known as siloxanes. These substances smooth, straighten and add shine to hair and are “ubiquitous” in hair care products, the authors write.Despite their abundance, the researchers warn, siloxanes haven’t been adequately studied in humans. Animal studies suggest siloxanes can accumulate in the body and cause liver, lung and nervous system damage, but it isn’t clear how they affect humans, especially during hair care routines that typically take place in tight spaces and involve heated styling tools.In a bid to learn more, researchers conducted experiments in a “tiny house laboratory” outfitted with a ventilator, bathroom exhaust fan and portable air conditioner. Over two months, they did 46 emissions tests, recruiting healthy volunteers ages 18 to 65 to replicate their own hair care routines using the products and styling tools they prefer at home.As the volunteers did their hair, the researchers monitored volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions with a mass spectrometer. Siloxane emissions accounted for between 71 and 99 percent of VOC emissions during the experiments; in experiments with hair straightening and curling, VOCs surged every time the hair products were applied.Hair care routines involving heat produced more VOC emissions, with hair straightening pushing emissions higher than any other styling method. This is likely due to the prolonged contact of the straightener with the saturated hair and freshly applied products, the researchers surmise.During one experiment, participants applied the products to their hair without heat, then with heated styling tools at two higher temperatures. Though emissions existed even without heat, they were up to 3.1 times as high at the hair-straightening tools’ highest heat setting. Those with long hair generated more emissions than those with shorter styles.Emissions generated during heated hair care were “substantially” higher than those measured in previous studies that looked at other personal care products like shampoos that are designed to be washed away, the researchers write. Though having the bathroom fan on during the hair care routine helped significantly reduce exposure, they say, the doses of siloxane exposure were still high.“Studies of the long-term impact of siloxane exposures to human health are urgently needed,” they conclude. The products may also affect the atmosphere in urban areas, they write, contributing up to six tons of such emissions to the atmosphere every year in the United States.",2788,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/12/03/hair-straightening-emissions-health/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPUY3WUW3TRGS5VYCJMX5JQKZM.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPUY3WUW3TRGS5VYCJMX5JQKZM.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPUY3WUW3TRGS5VYCJMX5JQKZM.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPUY3WUW3TRGS5VYCJMX5JQKZM.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPUY3WUW3TRGS5VYCJMX5JQKZM.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LPUY3WUW3TRGS5VYCJMX5JQKZM.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,liver adequately due shampoo freshly curl problem bathroom contact smooth accumulate suggest urban style human body abundance vocs place laboratory space environmental prefer apply personal hair design spectrometer generate test nervous high typically conduct exhaust experiment siloxane organic ventilator system learn author analysis method healthy concludes bid set reduce level endanger shiny technology exposure atmosphere volunteer volatile contribute straighten away tool research tiny impact heat replicate health researcher age affect month air prolong ubiquitous shorter involve warn focus year push house conclude conditioner lung write united measure significantly surge wash monitor mass recruiting compound voc study routine emission area damage saturate time straightener substantially percent tight publish especially long portable emit outfit state exist temperature previous make produce product substance urgently animal add clear account participant science shine,0.31555,0.2152080344332855,13.109915254237286,0.4611160714285713,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,"At Mom’s Organic Market, saying goodbye to ‘Mom’s Organic Pinball’",2023-12-03 06:00:00,Justin Wm. Moyer,"The pinball machines at Mom’s Organic Market in College Park, Md., are not in plain sight. Only those willing to look beyond shelves stocked with kombucha and felt birdhouses will find what the grocery store’s owner says is one of the East Coast’s largest collections of pinball machines, hidden behind a sign for the bake shop and another for “sustainable proteins.”There, players enter a pinball paradise where they can sidle up to around 40 machines for as little as 25 cents per play. (Most pinball proprietors charge $1, players said.) Many machines bear the names of intellectual property that the pinball industry licenses: “Avengers,” “Lord of the Rings,” “AC/DC.” Some are decades-old classics familiar only to the initiated. And those who don’t favor pinball can play “Ms. Pac-Man” or “Street Fighter.”For about five years, this unusual symbiosis — organic produce meets flashing lights and flippers — has persisted at Mom’s thanks to the pinball enthusiasm of its founder, Scott Nash. But in the coming weeks, Nash said, the pinball room will close to make way for a business perhaps more essential but way less fun: an urgent-care center.Nash said he moved part of his collection of around 70 games into the back of the store in 2018.“I was competing against myself in my basement,” he said. “I wanted to compete with the world.”He knew the arrangement wasn’t permanent. Pinball, even at higher prices, isn’t a revenue generator, he said; the machines require expensive weekly maintenance.But since his landlord didn’t have a deep-pocketed tenant ready to move in, what regulars call a “pinball speakeasy” opened.“It was sorta like: ‘Hey, I’ll put my games here until they find something,’” Nash said. “Now they found someone to pay more rent … I don’t really blame them for doing what every business does.”Nash said he’s looking for another short-term space in the same shopping center as Mom’s but has not found a new home yet.CDG, the landlord for the store and shopping center, did not return requests for comment.On Wednesday evening at what’s dubbed “Mom’s Organic Pinball,” those who showed up for weekly league play were in mourning. Sitting in the Mom’s cafe area outside the pinball hall, Dan Northover, a retired sheet metal worker from Greenbelt, Md., said he’d played at the store since the machines first arrived. Few places offered as many games or were as diligent about their upkeep, Northover said.A new business that displaces “Flash Gordon” and “Creature From the Black Lagoon” would not be welcome. “We’re going to boycott whoever goes there,” he said.Dave Hubbard, a 49-year-old software engineer and Maryland’s current pinball state champion, was also reluctant to say goodbye. He knew the league would likely have to take a season or two off as Nash found a new location for his machines, but he hoped this wasn’t the end. His preferred term for the coming closure: “hiatus.”Hubbard, like many players at Mom’s, said he was attracted by pinball’s physical element. Many video games depend on memorizing patterns — once players learn the pattern and successfully execute it, the game is effectively over. But pinball machines are unpredictable, the bounce of their metal balls changing with each tilt or press of a flipper.“In theory, you could play a pinball machine forever,” Hubbard said.Stephanie Traub, an attorney at the State Department and a deputy commissioner of the Mom’s Organic Pinball League, paused her game to explain the league’s somewhat arcane point system. While talking, she let a ball come to rest on a flipper, then held the flipper’s button to prevent her ball from “draining” — that is, being sucked into the machine’s innards.The loss of the Mom’s space was “a major loss for local competitive pinball and local pinball in general,” Traub said. While bars or restaurants in the area might have some machines, the sheer variety and volume of Nash’s collection was unmatched for miles, she said.And Mom’s hours couldn’t be beat.“This place opens at 9 a.m.,” she said. “I don’t necessarily want to play pinball at 9 a.m., but it’s nice to know that there’s someplace I could go.”The closure of Mom’s pinball speakeasy comes despite boom times for the game. Zach Sharpe, director of marketing for Stern Pinball — manufacturer of “Venom,” “Stranger Things” and “Elvira’s House of Horrors,” among many other machines — said in a statement that the business has grown by up to 30 percent annually in recent years. Stern even doubled its manufacturing space earlier this year, he said.“Pinball has never been hotter!” Stern’s statement said. “We will continue creating compelling entertainment that inspires a lifetime love of games, sparks passion, forges friendships, and connects people everywhere through fun, innovative, technologically advanced pinball games, and experiences. After all, pinball is the universal language of fun!”Though pinball existed long before “Pong,” “Super Mario Bros.” and first-person shooting games, Nash described the 21st century as “peak pinball.” Even as his machines, worth up to $10,000 each, rise in value, he is reluctant to part with them. He has some available for play at another Mom’s location in Abington, Pa., and plans to put others in storage as he figures out his next move.“I might sell off a few of them,” he said. “But most of them that I have, I like. I’ll keep them.”Sandro Fouche, who teaches computer programming at Montgomery College, came to Mom’s Wednesday with his wife, Kimberly. Though the couple used to live with their four children a few blocks from the grocery store, Kimberly got interested in pinball only after they moved to Kensington, Md., about five years ago.“My wife got into it during the pandemic,” he said. “A lot of people got into it during the pandemic.”Rather than trek to College Park, the couple usually relies on the machines in their home to get their pinball fix. Fouche declined to specify the number — but said he once convinced a roommate to keep a pinball machine in their apartment in lieu of a dining room table.Mom’s is “the absolute best place to play” in the D.C. region, Fouche said. Soon, players will have to play somewhere else.",6180,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/03/moms-organic-pinball-college-park/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,roommate peak engineer local market stranger offer sell friendship birdhouse attract expensive double hotter fix store prevent nice unpredictable speakeasy element pay place played ball super hubbard unmatched scott forge shopping gordon lifetime abington initiate cafe innovative technologically held cent pattern language game black closure flipper learn stock entertainment traub sharpe found bounce sorta compelling mile reluctant bear volume lagoon property retire sheet hop fun venom boycott trek pinball kimberly park pause champion sign create require sheer ring charge unusual player greenbelt successfully light wednesday flash mom sight relies enter value coast arrive knew inspires intellectual felt specify welcome competitive shoot meet regular blame back available program elvira recent teach paradise put passion center part kombucha convince percent upkeep universal grown manufacturer department rent favor close persist price northover open street dubbed montgomery home rest loss necessarily fouche large pong produce license absolute business bar stern hey owner diligent plan move find number familiar button space manufacturing plain region prefer earlier decline revenue zach arrangement forever attorney talk worth ready weekly deputy high compete play tenant child major shop displaces bake commissioner organic described system marketing general hour depend landlord call interested enthusiasm annually college storage permanent basement hidden room classic arcane request director wife continue term effectively horror machine sidle mario collection location restaurant shelf lot press week couple point variety industry boom physical execute year avenger change house block explain east kensington software hall connects lieu generator founder computer current someplace sandro apartment suck goodbye grocery essential live statement memorize despite figure metal drain century worker area experience return video time advanced season proprietor mourn long lord tilt league symbiosis show creature maryland rise sustainable nash spark exist pandemic make theory love state,0.99665,0.0970873786407767,6.824873174481162,0.4556578442654391,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Strong earthquake that sparked a tsunami warning leaves 1 dead amid widespread panic in Philippines,2023-12-03 02:09:00,JIM GOMEZ Associated Press,"MANILA, Philippines -- A powerful earthquake that shook the southern Philippines killed at least one villager and injured several others as thousands scrambled out of their homes in panic and jammed roads to higher grounds after a tsunami warning was issued, officials said Sunday.The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the quake Saturday night had a magnitude of 7.6 and struck at a depth of 32 kilometers (20 miles). The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said it expected tsunami waves to hit the southern Philippines and parts of Indonesia, Palau and Malaysia, but later dropped its tsunami warning.The USGS recorded a further earthquake Sunday with a magnitude of 6.6, east of the municipality of Hinuatan and at a depth of 56 kilometers (34 miles), but there was no tsunami alert. The Philippine seismological agency described it as an aftershock.In Japan, authorities issued evacuation orders late Saturday in various parts of Okinawa prefecture, including for the entire coastal area, affecting thousands of people.A pregnant woman died after she, her husband and daughter were hit by a 15-feet (4.5-meter) concrete wall that collapsed in their neighborhood as the ground shook and prompted them to flee from their house in Tagum city in Davao del Norte province, the city’s disaster-mitigation chief, Shieldon Isidoro, told The Associated Press.Her husband and daughter were injured. Two other children and their parents jumped from a second-floor window in panic as their house swayed but were not injured after landing on a grassy lot, said Isidoro, who was at his home when the ground started to shake.""Initially the swaying was weak. Then it quickly became stronger and I could hardly stand. My perfume bottles fell off a table, pictures on my wall swung and I heard people screaming outside: 'Get out, get out, earthquake, earthquake!”’ Isidoro said.While he feared the roof of his house would collapse on him, Isidoro said he was more worried that there could be many casualties in Tagum, a city of about 300,000 people, where he had led regular earthquake drills that he thought helped prevent more deaths and injuries.Hundreds of patients were evacuated from a Tagum hospital but later were escorted back after an inspection showed no major damage to the building, officials said.Thousands of residents stayed outside their homes for hours in many towns due to the earthquake and tsunami scare, including in some that were drenched by an overnight downpour, officials said.Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr told a news conference that authorities were assessing the quake’s impact but initial reports indicated there were no major damages except for two damaged bridges and pockets of power outages. One death was reported with a few injuries, he said.Teresito Bacolcol, the head of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, told The AP shortly after the quake hit that his agency advised residents along the coast of Surigao del Sur and Davao Oriental provinces, which were near the epicenter of the undersea quake, to immediately evacuate to higher ground or move farther inland.Pictures posted on the Facebook account of Hinatuan town in Surigao del Sur province show residents fleeing to higher ground on foot or aboard cars, trucks, motorcycles and tricycle taxis overnight.Many villagers who fled to evacuation centers returned to their homes on Sunday, officials said.After undertaking inspections, civil aviation officials said there was no major damage in several airports in the south and there was no disruption in flights operations.The Philippines, one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, is often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of seismic faults around the ocean. The archipelago is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year.___",3866,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/strong-earthquake-sparked-tsunami-warning-leaves-1-dead-105337885,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/167a28a5-eab1-4e84-94e3-6df69725d424/wirestory_cf74e4071a06f8257e6509602d19bc15_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,typhoon power scream advise drench prevent powerful fault night car undertaking scramble drill building start motorcycle volcanology truck taxi stand parent depth bottle struck ocean sunday seismology casualty epicenter mile alert picture coastal japan swayed injured shieldon wave impact fell bridge jr city woman palau ring quickly institute initially teodoro pacific pregnant coast magnitude geological regular surigao fire window back official shortly facebook drop seismological weak evacuation davao hinatuan country aboard seismic indicate center part volcanic initial province conference death downpour flee record home strong airport malaysia shake prefecture foot issue neighborhood grassy patient table lash account shook expect due municipality concrete disruption storm move land quake overnight order entire hospital panic farther evacuate include post escort south civil indonesia high major assess child sway arc kill described outage hour worried husband scare news injury lead resident told chief pocket ground inspection roof earthquake location lot world perfume thousand authority affect warn flight house secretary collapse east wall tagum bacolcol villager associate immediately head manila jammed hinuatan agency undersea area return damage survey swung heard gilberto archipelago oriental jumped isidoro kilometer tsunami hit okinawa show stayed philippine usgs late eruption southern prompt daughter tricycle aviation fear road saturday report town norte,-0.9952,0.4655975168132437,12.036283185840706,0.3362179487179487,0,2023-12-03
CNN,Tina Fey returns to ‘SNL’ to welcome Emma Stone to the Five-Timers Club,2023-12-03 01:17:00,Alli Rosenbloom,"Esteemed “Saturday Night Live” alum Tina Fey made a surprise cameo on the long-running sketch show’s latest episode to help initiate host Emma Stone into the so-called Five-Timers Club.Fey, a six-time host, told Stone that at 35 years old, she was the youngest person to reach the milestone.Other celebrities who have hosted five or more times include Will Ferrell, Ben Affleck and Melissa McCarthy, among others. Fey, who was with the show from 1997-2006, was the first female former cast member to join the Five-Timers Club.Fey jokingly told Stone that there’s a “women’s section” in the club, of which Candice Bergen, a five-time host, is the founder. Bergen then joined Fey and Stone on stage.“The women’s section started out as a small, quiet place to cry,” Bergen, the first female host to hit the five-time milestone in 1990, joked. Now, she added, it’s a “big, luxurious place to cry.”Bergen went on to say more earnestly, “Emma, this is your day. You’re part of ‘SNL’ her-story.”Oscar-winner Stone hosted her fifth episode on Saturday, alongside musical guest Noah Kahan. She previously hosted in 2010, 2011, 2016 and 2019.At the end of Stone’s monologue, Fey did the honors of presenting her with the official Five-Timers jacket.“This has been a dream of mine since I was a kid and it means so much that I get to share this moment with you guys,” Stone said.",1368,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/entertainment/tina-fey-emma-stone-five-timers/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231203001108-01-emma-stone-snl-rehearsal.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bergen tina saturday cry mccarthy guy small earnestly emma previously night big noah episode musical esteem celebrity young initiate woman female affleck fey melissa place candice live day club sketch stone ferrell person show start share present quiet hit alum guest make section time official cast moment join milestone dream late year monologue kid include snl member told host luxurious honor reach surprise cameo former part joked founder jokingly alongside add,0.8951499999999999,0.0,6.431535836177471,0.3,0,2023-12-03
ABC,Barbie doll honoring Cherokee Nation leader met with mixed emotions,2023-12-03 00:12:00,SEAN MURPHY Associated Press,"OKLAHOMA CITY -- An iconic chief of the Cherokee Nation, Wilma Mankiller, inspired countless Native American children as a powerful but humble leader who expanded early education and rural healthcare.Her reach is now broadening with a quintessential American honor: a Barbie doll in the late Mankiller's likeness as part of toymaker Mattel's “Inspiring Women” series.A public ceremony honoring Mankiller’s legacy is set for Tuesday in Tahlequah in northeast Oklahoma, where the Cherokee Nation is headquartered.Mankiller was the nation's first female principal chief, leading the tribe for a decade until 1995. She focused on improving social conditions through consensus and on restoring pride in Native heritage. She met with three U.S. presidents and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award.She also met snide remarks about her surname — a military title — with humor, often delivering a straight-faced response: “Mankiller is actually a well-earned nickname.” She died in 2010.The tribe’s current leader, Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin, Jr., applauded Mattel for commemorating Mankiller.“When Native girls see it, they can achieve it, and Wilma Mankiller has shown countless young women to be fearless and speak up for Indigenous and human rights,” Hoskin said in a statement. “Wilma Mankiller is a champion for the Cherokee Nation, for Indian Country, and even my own daughter.”Mankiller, whose likeness is on a U.S. quarter issued in 2021, is the second Native American woman honored with a Barbie doll. Famed aviator Bessie Coleman, who was of Black and Cherokee ancestry, was depicted earlier this year.Other dolls in the series include Maya Angelou, Ida B. Wells, Jane Goodall and Madam C.J. Walker.The rollout of the Barbie doll featuring Mankiller wearing a ribbon skirt, black shoes and carrying a woven basket has been met with conflicting reactions.Many say the doll is a fitting tribute for a remarkable leader who faced conflict head-on and helped the tribe triple its enrollment, double its employment and build new health centers and children's programs.Still, some Cherokee women are critical, saying Mattel overlooked problematic details on the doll and the packaging.“Mixed emotions shared by me and many other Cherokee women who have now purchased the product revolve around whether a Wilma Barbie captures her legacy, her physical features and the importance of centering Cherokee women in decision making,” Stacy Leeds, the law school dean at Arizona State University and a former Cherokee Nation Supreme Court justice, told The Associated Press in an email.Regina Thompson, a Cherokee basket weaver who grew up near Tahlequah, doesn't think the doll looks like Mankiller. Mattel should have considered traditional pucker toe moccasins, instead of black shoes, and included symbols on the basket that Cherokees use to tell a story, she said.“Wilma’s name is the only thing Cherokee on that box,” Thompson said. “Nothing about that doll is Wilma, nothing.”The Cherokee language symbols on the packaging also are wrong, she noted. Two symbols look similar, and the one used translates to “Chicken,” rather than “Cherokee.”Mattel spokesperson Devin Tucker said the company is aware of the problem with the syllabary and is “discussing options.” The company worked with Mankiller's estate, which is led by her husband, Charlie Soap, and her friend, Kristina Kiehl, on the creation of the doll. Soap and Kiehl did not respond to messages left by the AP.Mattel did not consult with the Cherokee Nation on the doll.“Regrettably, the Mattel company did not work directly with the tribal government's design and communications team to secure the official Seal or verify it,” the tribe said in a statement. ""The printing mistake itself does not diminish what it means for the Cherokee people to see this tribute to Wilma and who she was and what she stood for.”Several Cherokees also criticized Mattel for not consulting with Mankiller's only surviving child, Felicia Olaya, who said she was unaware of the doll until about a week before its public launch.“I have no issues with the doll. I have no issues with honoring my mom in different ways,” said Olaya, who acknowledged she and Soap, her stepfather, are estranged. “The issue is that no one informed me, no one told me. I didn't know it was coming.”Olaya also wonders how her mother would feel about being honored with a Barbie doll.“I heard her once on the phone saying, ‘I’m not Princess Diana, nor am I Barbie,’” Olaya recalled. “I think she probably would have been a little conflicted on that, because my mom was very humble. She wasn’t the type of person who had her honorary degrees or awards plastered all over the wall. They were in tubs in her pole barn.”“I’m not sure how she would feel about this,"" Olaya said.Still, Olaya said she hopes to buy some of the dolls for her grandchildren and is always grateful for people to learn about her mother's legacy.",4974,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/barbie-doll-honoring-cherokee-nation-leader-met-mixed-105336883,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/68b55b74-767b-4043-b656-7337cd077869/Barbie-doll-of-Wilma-Mankiller_1701585801336_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,traditional bessie northeast goodall broadening grateful title mankiller double secure instead tribal improve human honorary estrange powerful restore critical maya design leeds stepfather overlook detail aware former rollout doll heritage weaver plaster language black learn freedom hope expand set mixed kiehl tahlequah problematic mistake enrollment pucker build purchase justice quarter moccasin health government champion city woman diana decade jane skirt note left criticize communication condition supreme feel acknowledge university person shoe depict mom spokesperson pride remark early social coleman olaya tucker likeness creation civilian official receive medal cherokee toe american wear type country team surname center countless part kristina dean humble message ribbon humor mattel tribe presidential wonder buy arizona issue company leader iconic princess aviator estate syllabary directly problem native inform commemorate indigenous tub work indian carry recall nation similar consult earlier oklahoma charlie packaging public tribute include probably barbie wrong unaware girl famed law high child award conflict angelou soap snide triple seal mother reach hoskin chicken toymaker ancestry tuesday husband friend fearless lead woven importance legacy honor told chief basket president inspire diminish phone press week speak rural share education military young physical consider focus applaud respond consensus b feature story wall translates current survive achieve associate discuss statement different remarkable stacy chuck capture fitting school thompson grow devin heard decision madam court verify quintessential female revolve stood response symbol show principal grandchild late series box printing regrettably wilma make emotion employment ceremony product deliver felicia ida pole state degree,0.99565,1.6284680337756332,9.558354430379744,0.4151143906598452,0,2023-12-03

ABC,"Lacking counselors, US schools turn to the booming business of online therapy",2023-12-03 00:05:00,JOCELYN GECKER AP education writer,"Trouble with playground bullies started for Maria Ishoo’s daughter in elementary school. Girls ganged up, calling her “fat” and “ugly.” Boys tripped and pushed her. The California mother watched her typically bubbly second-grader retreat into her bedroom and spend afternoons curled up in bed.For Valerie Aguirre’s daughter in Hawaii, a spate of middle school “friend drama” escalated into violence and online bullying that left the 12-year-old feeling disconnected and lonely.Both children received help through telehealth therapy, a service that schools around the country are offering in response to soaring mental health struggles among American youth.Now at least 16 of the 20 largest U.S. public school districts are offering online therapy sessions to reach millions of students, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. In those districts alone, schools have signed provider contracts worth more than $70 million.The growth reflects a booming new business born from America’s youth mental health crisis, which has proven so lucrative that venture capitalists are funding a new crop of school teletherapy companies. Some experts raise concerns about the quality of care offered by fast-growing tech companies.As schools cope with shortages of in-person practitioners, however, educators say teletherapy works for many kids, and it’s meeting a massive need. For rural schools and lower-income students in particular, it has made therapy easier to access. Schools let students connect with online counselors during the school day or after hours from home.“This is how we can prevent people from falling through the cracks,” said Ishoo, a mother of two in Lancaster, California.Ishoo recalls standing at her second-grader's bedroom door last year and wishing she could get through to her. “What’s wrong?” the mother would ask. The response made her heart heavy: “It’s NOTHING, Mom.”Last spring, her school district launched a teletherapy program and she signed up her daughter. During a month of weekly sessions, the girl logged in from her bedroom and opened up to a therapist who gave her coping tools and breathing techniques to reduce anxiety. The therapist told her daughter: You are in charge of your own emotions. Don’t give anyone else that control.“She learned that it’s OK to ask for help, and sometimes everyone needs some extra help,” Ishoo said.The 13,000-student school system, like so many others, has counselors and psychologists on staff, but not enough to meet the need, said Trish Wilson, the Lancaster district’s coordinator of counselors.Therapists in the area have full caseloads, making it impossible to refer students for immediate care, she said. But students can schedule a virtual session within days.“Our preference is to provide our students in-person therapy. Obviously, that’s not always possible,” said Wilson, whose district has referred more than 325 students to over 800 sessions since launching the online therapy program.Students and their parents said in interviews they turned to teletherapy after struggling with feelings of sadness, loneliness, academic stress and anxiety. For many, the transition back to in-person school after distance learning was traumatic. Friendships had fractured, social skills deteriorated and tempers flared more easily.Schools are footing the bill, many of them using federal pandemic relief money as experts have warned of alarming rates of youth depression, anxiety and suicide. Many school districts are signing contracts with private companies. Others are working with local health care providers, nonprofits or state programs.Mental health experts welcome the extra support but caution about potential pitfalls. For one, it’s getting harder to hire school counselors and psychologists, and competition with telehealth providers isn't helping.“We have 44 counselor vacancies, and telehealth definitely impacts our ability to fill them,” said Doreen Hogans, supervisor of school counseling in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Hogans estimates 20% of school counselors who left have taken teletherapy jobs, which offer more flexible hours.The rapid growth of the companies raises questions about the qualifications of the therapists, their experience with children and privacy protocols, said Kevin Dahill-Fuchel, executive director of Counseling in Schools, a nonprofit that helps schools bolster traditional, in-person mental health services.“As we give these young people access to telehealth, I want to hear how all these other bases are covered,” he said.One of the biggest providers, San Francisco-based Hazel Health, started with telemedicine health services in schools in 2016 and expanded to mental health in May 2021, CEO Josh Golomb said. It now employs more than 300 clinicians providing teletherapy in over 150 school districts in 15 states.The rapid expansions mean millions of dollars in revenue for Hazel. This year, the company signed a $24 million contract with Los Angeles County to offer teletherapy services to 1.3 million students for two years.Other clients include Hawaii, which is paying Hazel nearly $4 million over three years to work with its public schools, and Clark County schools in the Las Vegas area, which have allocated $3.25 million for Hazel-provided teletherapy. The districts of Miami-Dade, Prince George’s and Houston schools also have partnered with Hazel.Despite the giant contracts, Golomb said Hazel is focused on ensuring child welfare outweighs the bottom line.“We have the ethos of a nonprofit company but we’re using a private-sector mechanism to reach as many kids as we can,” Golomb said. Hazel raised $51.5 million in venture capital funding in 2022 that fueled its expansion. “Do we have any concerns about any compromise in quality? The resounding answer is no.”Other providers are getting into the space. In November, New York City launched a free telehealth therapy service for teens to help eliminate barriers to access, said Ashwin Vasan, the city's health commissioner. New York is paying the startup TalkSpace $26 million over three years for a service allowing teens aged 13 to 17 to download an app and connect with licensed therapists by phone, video or text.Unlike other cities, New York is offering the service to all teens, whether enrolled in private, public or home schools, or not in school at all.“I truly hope this normalizes and democratizes access to mental health care for our young people,” Vasan said.Many of Hawaii’s referrals come from schools in rural or remote areas. Student clients have increased sharply in Maui since the deadly August wildfires, said Fern Yoshida, who oversees teletherapy for the state education department. So far this fall, students have logged 2,047 teletherapy visits, a three-fold increase from the same period last year.One of them was Valerie Aguirre's daughter, whose fallout with two friends turned physical last year in sixth grade, when one of the girls slapped her daughter in the face. Aguirre suggested her daughter try teletherapy. After two months of online therapy, “she felt better,” Aguirre said, with a realization that everyone makes mistakes and friendships can be mended.In California, Ishoo says her daughter, now in third grade, is relaying wisdom to her sister, who started kindergarten this year.“She walks her little sister to class and tells her everything will be OK. She’s a different person. She’s older and wiser. She reassures her sister,” Ishoo said. “I heard her say, ‘If kids are being mean to you, just ignore them.’”___Associated Press data reporter Sharon Lurye contributed.___",7605,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/lacking-counselors-us-schools-turn-booming-business-online-105336790,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/4ab688e2-7606-4a37-be9e-63e1fde48987/wirestory_bd7d650184decd94d4570e9841f1cedb_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,immediate traditional local offer friendship flare aguirre enrol allocate contract prevent york psychologist maui online pay reflect job cop born relief alarm executive spring distance start quality flexible bully venture stand boy traumatic parent escalate preference fern footing therapist period valerie concern heavy sister student session learn counselor privacy hope expand employ answer reduce hire expansion mistake cope possible sixth fuel barrier technique trish clinician free connect bedroom tool full definitely walk impact big health depression outweighs kid sign city charge vasan push left fat ensure san josh feel estimate fracture kindergarten vacancy normalizes playground person teletherapy physical provider give afternoon download counsel protocol social fill felt signing democratizes meeting welcome meet growth back program receive realization district funding cover deadly ceo app educator launch fall american transition crop compromise access country class mechanism fallout soar impossible trouble base vega refer education talkspace department yoshida hazel nonprofit open eliminate rate home oversees large qualification pitfall capitalist license skill wilson company proven spend hawaii expert business watch prince curl sharply supervisor kevin money raise shortage suggest houston work recall virtual space easy struggle wiser tech revenue public hear service include worth wrong drama wildfire girl weekly typically accord child particular clark commissioner interview sharon system million wish competition analysis hour george bill call mother youth reach slap lancaster federal anxiety rapid welfare therapy november friend staff caseloads director told referral retreat partner ethos reporter practitioner phone increase temper harder press crack coordinator county private golomb ishoo deteriorate capital day giant age startup rural boom month remote violence young warn dollar focus bottom year hogan academic bullying telemedicine lucrative question doreen tripped massive suicide telehealth maria associate ignore america schedule california different bubbly support gang feeling school middle angeles disconnect area experience heard video mental extra crisis provide offering august breathing data loneliness response client stress turn reassures ability sadness potential maryland ashwin wisdom lurye grade daughter relay pandemic elementary resound visit caution make emotion bolster heart state,0.1215999999999999,0.2366863905325443,11.042476329206114,0.4072793683589138,0,2023-12-03
Washington Post,Ask Amy: My husband choosing to miss my 70th birthday is the ‘last straw’,2023-12-03 00:00:00,Amy Dickinson,"Dear Amy: My husband let me know that he and our two daughters will be traveling 2,000 miles to celebrate his brother’s 70th birthday, which is two days before my 70th birthday. I am so angry and disappointed that he would do this. His brother and wife have never visited us in our home state.This was all done behind my back, and then after I learned about it, I was told that we would celebrate my birthday sometime in the following month. We’ve had many problems in our marriage, but this feels like the last straw. I can’t seem to move on.Any ideas on how to move on and get over my anger?— Had ItHad It: One way to move on would be to actually move on.Given the way you have described this (topping off a troubled marriage, your husband plans a secret trip with your daughters to celebrate his brother’s landmark birthday, while deliberately ignoring yours), I think you should use their time away to contact a lawyer and educate yourself about your financial prospects, as well as the personal and emotional consequences of you leaving the marriage.Truth be told, it seems that your husband has already at least partially left. After doing this research, you may decide to stay, at least for now, but it will be your choice.You can use the anger you feel to spur you to action. Being armed with real information and an actual choice could empower you to feel more in control of your own life, and your anger should dissipate. (It may morph into other very challenging emotions.)If you do decide to stay, a therapist could help you to move through the emotional fallout from this “last straw.”Dear Amy: Many years ago, while I was at work, my sister-in-law asked my 3-year-old daughter (who is very mature) if she would like her to be her godmother. I found out later when my daughter asked me, “Auntie asked me if I wanted her to be my godmother. What is that?”I was completely offended by this very inappropriate behavior by an adult. This is not a conversation to be conducted with a young child in the absence of the parent.When I confronted my brother about this, he did his usual behavior of hiding the truth by claiming it was a misunderstanding. He was certain she meant “fairy godmother” or something imaginary like that.I hated being played for stupid. I expected an apology, so later, I confronted my SIL. To this day, she blames my daughter for misunderstanding and has never apologized for stepping over a serious boundary. And to make matters worse, she threw my very daughter “under the bus” for misunderstanding her, rather than acknowledging her own misdeed!This has caused a many-year rift in family compatibility, which has been uncomfortable. So, trying to be practical about things, I told my SIL, “I will drop this, but I will never believe you about this.”I am tired of their obnoxious attitude and disrespect for others. Now things are a bit better in the family relationship.How do you recommend I move forward knowing that my SIL will NEVER admit an error and makes terrible judgment calls?— Played for StupidPlayed: You say this happened “many years ago.” You have ruminated and fumed about this incident all that time. Surely it is time to stop, if only for your own sake.At this point, you have all the information you need to have regarding your sister-in-law's long-ago behavior, as well as the fact that she will never apologize for it.

Washington Post,Carolyn Hax: Life ‘really opened up’ post-divorce — just not for ex-wife and child,2023-12-03 00:00:00,Carolyn Hax,"Dear Carolyn: Three years ago, I woke up to the fact that I wasn’t happy with my life. The pandemic made me realize there are no guarantees and you have to live your life now. I’d been married five years, right out of college, to my high school sweetheart, and it hit me that I was 27 with a wife and kid and mortgage, living like I was 40, and if I didn’t do something, life was going to pass me by.As much as it hurt, I left and started over, and I’m so happy now. I have a great apartment, I’m getting noticed at work, I’m dating casually, I’m even planning a three-week trip to South America. Life has really opened up for me.I wish I could say the same of my ex-wife, but she has just shut down. She moved back in with her folks, which is so sad — she’s never had her own place; she even lived at home during college. From what I can tell, she doesn’t date, even though she’s a young, good-looking woman with a good job and our son is old enough now to leave with a babysitter.I’ll always love her. I’ve tried reaching out, but she doesn’t respond to any overtures unless it’s about our son. You got a letter recently from someone who didn’t like questions from her ex about her love life. I’m honestly not doing that; I don’t care if she dates, I just want her to have a full life. I’d like to get together with her and talk about what she’s doing and encourage her to want more for herself. Is that out of line?— AnonymousAnonymous: You divorced your standing to want things for her. So, yes, out of line.Apparently, you also left her to do the heavy daily work of living a premature middle age and rearing your son while you went out and got your 20s back. Out of line and in her face.Over the years, I’ve read letters with some nerve, but this one has some freaking nerve. (That’s two levels up from basic nerve.)You don’t mention anything about money, and maybe that’s because it isn’t an issue, and maybe that’s because you’re giving her enough in child support and possibly alimony to enable her to move herself and your son out of her parents’ home into quality housing of her own, and she simply has chosen not to do that. If so, then, okay — I’ll back off that part of it.And if you share custody or if she has your son because you tried for but weren’t awarded custody, then I might even lay down a few of my torches and pitchforks.But even if you didn’t dump all your responsibilities, only your marriage, then there are still layers of omg here, including that you didn’t mention the financial or custodial arrangements at all in your letter lamenting her choices. It’s relevant, no? Whether she can club-hop with Life and spend three weeks overseas while you primary-parent?And then there’s the ick of condescension. Maybe “sad” to her is what you did, or an apartment for her and kid, and “full” is the life a multigenerational, multi-adult household gives your child. Not that this way or your way or whatever other way is right, just that a narrow mind is wrong. Read what you wrote again and imagine it’s through her eyes this time — then once more, through a friendly disinterested-newspaper-stranger’s eyes. Maybe she thinks the definition of “sad” is to equate a spouse, home and a child to having “life pass me by.”And then there’s your complete omission — maybe it’s denial? — of how her embracing your vision of “more” would conveniently let you off the guilt hook.I will go on the record now, as I probably should have a few harrumphant paragraphs ago, with my firm belief that white-knuckling through life in an unhappy marriage is not a virtue. If you were miserable, and if you threw your whole self into trying to fix the marriage only to feel just as stuck, then a choice to leave was valid and arguably necessary.But how and whom you leave matters — so if you sloughed off all that life weight onto her instead of carrying every ounce of it that you were still responsible for, then you own that, whether she lives happily ever after you or not. Just as you don’t own her struggle anymore if you’re pulling your weight.Absent these key details, I have to give you two answers:If you do owe her more as a co-parent, then improve her life by stepping up more as a co-parent — not not not by appointing yourself her life coach.If you already do beyond your share as a co-parent, then trust and accept that as your only appropriate contribution to her prospects in life, which are otherwise now up to her.",4437,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/12/03/carolyn-hax-ex-post-divorce/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,nerve divorce valid freak fix instead step alimony improve lament place job recently layer simply conveniently stuck mention great start quality stand enable detail parent relevant rear heavy sweetheart equate vision appropriate mind dear answer belief notice shut carolyn owe housing marriage slough married full kid sad woman left omg arguably feel happy torch give anymore encourage ago write imagine date custody custodial friendly back unhappy weight matter household part mortgage anonymousanonymous accept casually miserable open record living home possibly ounce issue spend folk pull money move omission letter ick work carry line responsible struggle trip overseas include arrangement talk probably chosen planning guarantee wrong choice fact south high complete child award appoint eye honestly wish embrace reach level college responsibility wife contribution key leave paragraph definition week age firm premature share young life read year respond denial dump prospect question narrow apartment threw america realize overture hurt live daily support woke school middle harrumphant spouse lay time trust hit happily condescension virtue multigenerational guilt pandemic financial basic make love,0.99125,0.1352265043948614,4.765937813440317,0.5382321141016793,0,2023-12-03

Thirty years later, Martin told host Maria Hinojosa her vision for the show was ""to reflect the diversity of the Latino community in all of its beauty, and in all of its pain."" Martin also trained generations of journalists in Guatemala, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Kyrgyzstan and the U.S. She founded a nonprofit called the GraciasVida Center for Media to improve public radio coverage of Central America. In her memoir Crossing Borders, Building Bridges: A Journalist's Heart in Latin America, she wrote about overcoming racism and sexism in her work devoted to training other Latina journalists. She won many awards, including for her documentary series Despues de las Guerras: Central America After the Wars, was a Fulbright fellow, and was inducted into the National Association of Hispanic Journalists Hall of Fame.

NPR,Kiss performs its final concert. But has the band truly reached the 'End of the Road'?,2023-12-02 18:06:00,Chloe Veltman,"""Their schtick lifted them up to the absolute top,"" music writer Joel Selvin, the author of numerous books about rock musicians including Linda Ronstadt, the Grateful Dead and Sly and the Family Stone, told NPR. On Saturday, the memorable stagecraft that made Kiss one of the biggest selling hard rock bands in the world will come to an end, as its members perform what they are touting as their final show of their aptly titled, four-year-long ""End of the Road World Tour"" — at Madison Square Garden in New York. The concert will be available to watch live on Pay-Per-View. ""It has nothing to do with personalities in the band or tensions or a difference of opinion or musicality. It's purely practical,"" said Kiss co-founder, rhythm guitarist and vocalist Paul Stanley in an interview with the music publication Ultimate Classic Rock of the band's reasons for bringing five decades of Kiss to an end. ""You can play beat the clock, but ultimately the clock wins."" The city has apparently gone Kiss-crazy in the days leading up to the occasion, with the appearance of Kiss-themed taxis, Metro cards and pizza boxes. On Wednesday, the New York Rangers hosted KISS Game Night, featuring Kiss-related activities and ""limited-edition KISS x Rangers merchandise."" Band members also made an appearance at an Empire State Building lighting ceremony on Thursday. Staged in honor of Kiss' swan song, Empire State emitted the colored lights associated with the band — silver, red, purple, green and blue. Despite all the hooplah, this may not in fact be Kiss' goodbye kiss. The band undertook a previous ""farewell tour"" more than 20 years ago. After a brief hiatus, it started touring again on and off in 2003. Live shows and album releases flowed on from there. In interviews, band members have spoken about continuing on after Saturday's Madison Square Garden performance in one way or another. Both Stanley and co-frontman Gene Simmons have their own bands and say they aim at the very least to continue making appearances in those formats. ""Nobody ever really says goodbye,"" said rock critic Selvin, citing comebacks over the years by the likes of Cher, Steve Miller and the Grateful Dead. ""It's a show business strategy. You take a bow. But there's always an encore."" Selvin said artists often reappear after retiring because they can make a lot of money owing to fans' pent-up demand. For example, the pop-punk band Blink-182 is earning four times as much on its current reunion tour than it did when it last re-united in 2009, according to Far Out magazine. (The band issued a statement in 2005 saying it was going on ""indefinite hiatus,"" only to reunite four years later.) ""Personal life interferes, you want to disappear into the woodwork for a while and then demand builds and you go back to it,"" Selvin said. ""Steve Miller took his band apart in '99. He was just tired. And he was out for six years. And then in 2005, he put his band back together and suddenly his price was up, and there was more interest in seeing him."" Meanwhile, some musical acts simply never retire. The Rolling Stones, for instance, are embarking on yet another North America tour in 2024. The band just announced additional dates. Selvin doesn't think we've heard the last of Kiss. ""The rule of the farewell tour is that you have to say goodbye to every hall, and sometimes you have to say goodbye twice,"" Selvin said. ""I do not expect this to be the last time that Kiss performs, any more than 'Fare Thee Well' was the last time The Grateful Dead performed.""",3535,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/02/1216753192/kiss-band-final-concert-end-of-the-road,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,grateful sell hiatus memorable title member silver farewell york reappear writer madison simply demand night personal hard building start taxi purely tire empire joel linda game rule steve musicality aptly format stagecraft activity encore owe build family retire npr apparently artist big purple cher city decade schtick dead strategy numerous light perform wednesday ago x date act announce paul available back put blue stone garden indefinite color concert green publication emit price appearance additional state metro gene swan issue rhythm final square difference release practical guitarist absolute business watch expect instance money rock magazine reunion pizza tension book reason thursday miller earn include band stanley fact card play accord musical flow interview top author tout suddenly sly red musician performs stag classic lead told honor interferes continue clock ultimate personality beat critic aim song tour comeback lot world day vocalist ultimately album merchandise life year bring roll undertook feature hall selvin win hooplah spoken current associate host goodbye america ranger lift live statement simmons occasion despite reunite heard time woodwork ronstadt bow interest show embark box music kiss previous road saturday make ceremony thee performance north opinion disappear,0.8882,0.0848656294200848,6.989860724233985,0.4369639544129339,0,2023-12-02
CNN,"Julianna Margulies, Susan Sarandon issue apologies over recent controversial comments sparked by Israel-Hamas war",2023-12-02 17:13:00,Dan Heching,"Julianna Margulies has released an apology after her recent comments on a podcast stoked controversy.In comments she made on an episode of the “Back Room with Andy Ostroy” podcast last month, the actress voiced criticism of certain marginalized communities for what she perceived to be their lack of support for Jews, among other things. The conversation between Margulies and Ostroy – who are both Jewish – was prompted by the Israel-Hamas war and the rise in antisemitism they have seen in this country since the war began.In a statement emailed to CNN on Friday via a representative, Margulies said she is “horrified” that her comments “offended the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities, communities I truly love and respect.”“I want to be 100% clear: Racism, homophobia, sexism, or any prejudice against anyone’s personal beliefs or identity are abhorrent to me, full stop,” she continued. “Throughout my career I have worked tirelessly to combat hate of all kind, end antisemitism, speak out against terrorist groups like Hamas, and forge a united front against discrimination. I did not intend for my words to sow further division, for which I am sincerely apologetic.”Susan Sarandon also issued an apology on Friday, pertaining to a comment she made last month at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York City.Video taken by the New York Post from a November 17 rally showed Sarandon saying to the crowd, “There are a lot of people that are afraid, that are afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of how it feels to be Muslim in this country.”Writing in a social media post this week, Sarandon said the “phrasing” she chose “was a terrible mistake, as it implies that until recently Jews have been strangers to persecution, when the opposite is true.” She also said she deeply regrets “diminishing this reality and hurting people” with her comment.“It was my intent to show solidarity in the struggle against bigotry of all kinds, and I am sorry I failed to do so.”",1983,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/entertainment/julianna-margulies-susan-sarandon-apologies-antisemitism/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231202122653-restricted-split-julianna-margulies-susan-sarandon.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,voiced hamas word medium issue black stop phrasing regret hurt social cnn terrible career hate release room episode sincerely muslim susan full recently group feel bigotry statement comment email marginalize crowd division chose abhorrent actress write back front margulies prompt make perceive deeply conversation forge lack andy combat struggle podcast kind tirelessly recent solidarity prejudice jewish love identity rise country sexism continued antisemitism sorry sarandon clear stoke personal criticism support sow week homophobia ostroy implies stranger york month reality show jew speak afraid november representative rally persecution time taste united terrorist intent opposite offend work lot apology intend belief julianna community diminish horrify fail pertain friday discrimination mistake racism post,-0.9801,0.0,9.043212435233162,0.4457395382395382,0,2023-12-02
CNN,"A wacky Emma Stone, musicals and more superheroes: The holiday movie preview 2023",2023-12-02 14:40:00,Dan Heching,"Whether you’re a lover of the holidays or not, this time of year is always a good one for cinephiles, because it’s when the last high-profile awards contenders come out, as well as a few dependable lowbrow cheesy holiday titles to round out the bunch.This year was quite out of the ordinary, though, since we almost didn’t make it to this point – twin strikes in Hollywood for much of the year put several major projects on hold, with release dates consequently shuffled and delayed.Nonetheless, the movie release calendar for the rest of this year is duly packed, so if you’re in the mood for something new, in a theater or at home, check out these upcoming titles. There’s a nice mix of holiday-themed content and not to choose from:Following the tried-and-true formula of holiday-timed rom-coms, this frothy title is a change of pace for former “Gossip Girl” Leighton Meester and heroic hunk Robbie Amell, who star as exes who end up spending the holidays together and – you guessed it – finding that maybe they shouldn’t have called it quits in the first place.“EXmas” is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.This one features Brandy Norwood and Heather Graham, in essentially the same format as above but instead of exes, they’re ex-friends. But amid the holiday cheer and all the Christmas sweaters, they won’t remain that way for long.“Best. Christmas. Ever!” is streaming on Netflix.For those of you who like a little blood and shoot-em-up with your figgy pudding and mistletoe, Joel Kinnaman is on John McClane duty in this dialog-free, John Woo-directed revenge thriller that looks sure to be a major palate cleanser from the rest of the holiday fare. After turning heads as Colonel Rick Flag in both “Suicide Squad” movies, Kinnaman stars here as the survivor of a drive-by shooting hellbent on exacting revenge against those who killed his child. Not to be confused with last year’s “Violent Night,” but kinda in the same general wheelhouse (minus David Harbour as Santa Claus).“Silent Night” is currently playing in theater nationwide.If you like some magical realism with your holiday movies (and who doesn’t?), Eddie Murphy and Tracy Ellis Ross has you covered with this festive caper that looks like what would happen if the model town in “Beetlejuice” came alive at Christmastime.“Candy Cane Lane” is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.And then there’s the kaiju (that’s Japanese for city-stomping monsters, to the uninitiated) lovers out there, who will surely welcome this import from the country that inspired Legendary Entertainment’s Monsterverse, which most recently dropped “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” on Apple TV+. From the trailers alone, “Minus One” looks like a return to the fundamentals of what makes Godzilla such a lasting, menacing cultural figure.“Godzilla Minus One” is currently playing in theaters nationwide.The one and only. After a record-breaking world tour, the countless Beyoncé worshippers who didn’t get tickets to a concert now have a chance to experience the spectacle in a movie theater. The album for which this tour was named shows Queen Bey in peak form, and the shows do not disappoint. Christmas is definitely coming early this year.“Renaissance: A film by Beyoncé is currently playing in theaters nationwide.While Anne Hathaway doesn’t play the title character, it’s all about her in this story of a new co-worker at a women’s prison who befriends Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie), which sets off a chain of sinister and disturbing events.“Eileen” is playing in theaters now.“Shayda” looks like a loving portrait of a woman committed to her daughter as the pair install themselves in an Australian women’s shelter during the two weeks of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year.“Shayda” is playing in select theaters.This paranoid-looking thriller has the feel of a disaster film mixed with commentary on class and race relations.

CNN,Opinion: No one does capitalism like Taylor Swift,2023-12-02 13:25:00,not specified,"There’s a whole cottage industry in pop culture essay writing dedicated to trying to unpack why Taylor Swift is so successful. Is it because she’s the epitome of Americana? Or the ultimate vehicle for “millennial vibes”? Champion of the underdogs? The final girlboss?In fact, her popularity is anchored in the way she manages to be all of these things, and none of them for very long, pivoting effortlessly from persona to persona and position to position; shedding her skin when necessary (like the “snake” she was famously compared to by Kim Kardashian) to reveal fresh new colors beneath.Constant reinvention is a given in pop iconhood, as countless prior and peer artists — from Michael Jackson and Madonna to Britney Spears and Justin Bieber — can attest. But no one else does it with the same casual, frictionless aplomb as Swift; her self-shifts don’t come off as acts of extravagant pick-me theater in the mode of Ariana Grande, or explosive artistic statements a la Beyoncé. Instead, they’re more like chord changes; variations in the key of Tay — eyebrow-raising, but never too extreme or off-putting. Which means that throughout all of her evolutions, she has remained accessible, approachable, personable and projectable; a cool hang for the guys, trusted bestie to the girls.This careful balancing act has been a key reason why she’s stayed relevant across a career of nearly two decades. And it’s why she’ll undoubtedly reach the milestone of best-selling female solo artist of all time (at over 180 million albums sold according to ChartMasters.org, only Celine Dion at more than 220 million and Madonna at 250 million stand in her way).The truth is, though, simply selling albums almost seems quaint now as a benchmark of Swiftian achievement. She’s now increasingly being spoken about as an economic force of nature, a transformative creator advocate, organizer and innovator and arguably the most influential — perhaps even the most powerful — figure in the music industry.It was Swift who, in reaction to Scooter Braun acquiring the company controlling her early music masters, chose the almost unthinkable path of re-recording her old albums one by one, creating versions of her classic songs that are now under her direct control. The move isn’t just an act of revenge against someone whose actions she’s referred to publicly as “bullying.” It’s a rebel stroke that cuts at the heart of the recording industry’s power over creators, and one that was only possible because Swift is songwriter on all of her original music, and because of the uniquely equitable contract she signed with her current label, Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Under the terms of that contract, Swift demanded full ownership of all of her master recordings going forward, plus a royalty of at least 50%.That said, it’s another clause in the agreement that demonstrates the full weight of Swift’s power: In an unprecedented move that seals her status as a kind of Joan of Arc for creator rights, she said she also got Universal, a major investor in Spotify, to agree that if it were to ever sell any of its shares, a non-recoupable split of those profits would be shared with Swift and all other fellow Universal recording artists.Swift has used the occasion of her reinvention of her musical past to launch an extended global performance circuit, the “Eras” tour, which could become the most lucrative music tour in history. It will, all in, represent a $5.7 billion boost to the US economy according to the Washington Post, while injecting a profound degree of monetary stimulus into every city hosting her, given that her fans collectively spend around $93 million per show.In Los Angeles, where she played six sold-out nights at SoFi Stadium, the tour generated enough money to support 3,300 jobs. And Swift generously showered her staff with spiffs, giving each of her tour truck drivers $100,000 in the summer, and providing other bonuses to her sound techs, backup dancers, catering crew and other staff, to the collective tune of $55 million. She can afford it. Already a billionaire, Swift stands to personally make as much as $4.1 billion from the “Eras” tour, according to estimates cited by the Post.That doesn’t even include the money she stands to earn from the concert film she shot while on tour, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which in yet another example of I’ll-do-it-myself disruption she paid for out of her own pocket as an independent production, eschbewing studio involvement, and subsequently distributed it via theater chain AMC. It has already earned more than $250 million at the box office, reportedly just under 60% of which will go straight to Swift’s production company, which will get another revenue bump when the film hits streaming platforms for rental and download on Dec. 13, Swift’s 34th birthday.Many have pointed out that her outsized success has nepo baby roots — the daughter of a Merrill Lynch stockbroker, she grew up on an 11-acre Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania, and her dad helped to boost her early success by buying part of her original label, Big Machine Records. Swift would have had a much harder road in her path to stardom, which began when she moved to the country music mecca of Nashville, had she not been White, a privilege she herself has acknowledged in recent years.Still, it’s Swift’s undeniable talent, her resourcefulness and her (blond) ambition that have gotten her where she is — that is to say, the very top. I admit to personally being a begrudging fan, not just of her music, but her incredible sense of enterprise. I take mental notes with every new move she makes — and if someone else doesn’t write a bestselling business tome detailing the lessons would-be moguls should learn from Swift’s savvy, I will.

CNN,Target date funds: What are they and are they right for you?,2023-12-02 10:00:00,Jeanne Sahadi,"If you are in a 401(k) plan at work, you very likely have the option to invest in a so-called target date fund, which also may be called a retirement date fund or a lifecycle fund.At the end of 2020, the vast majority of plans (86%) offered target date funds, and 59% of 401(k) participants had money invested in one.That’s according to an analysis by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, which reviewed anonymized data on 11.5 million 401(k) participant accounts from employers of all sizes.So what is a target date fund exactly? It’s a blend of stocks and bonds — an all-in-one portfolio — designed to offer an appropriate allocation for the average investor relative to their anticipated retirement date. In other words, you’d pick a fund that aims for a retirement year closest to the year you’ll turn 65. For example, if you’re 25, you might invest in a 2065 target date fund. If you’re 50, you would pick a 2040 fund.The high percentage of 401(k) participants with money in a target date fund is partly because it is often the default investment for employees who are automatically enrolled in a plan or whose plan changes hands after a merger.Typically a target date fund is a “fund of funds” – meaning its portfolio is made up of both stock funds and bond funds selected by the manager.Each target date fund has a future “glide path” for allocation, which is meant to grow more conservative over time. For instance, a fund aimed at a retirement date 40 years from now will be invested mostly in stocks (e.g., 90% stocks, 10% fixed income), whereas when the target date is just a few years away, the fund may allocate less than 50% to stocks – and by the actual retirement year, the stock allocation may be much less, said certified financial planner Madison Sharick of Madi Manages Money.And those underlying funds may well be index funds, which track specific markets or sectors, or the broader stock or bond market. As an example, Vanguard notes that its target date funds invest in Vanguard’s broadest index funds, essentially giving you exposure “to thousands of U.S. and international stocks and bonds.”Besides adjusting the fund’s allocation as your retirement approaches, the fund manager will rebalance the portfolio periodically to make sure the chosen asset allocation for a given year doesn’t get too out of whack due to market performance, said certified financial planner Bryan Minogue of Kardinal Financial.For example, Minogue noted, the fund may adjust quarterly to ensure it sticks to its assigned allocation (e.g., 70% stocks, 30% bonds). Or it may adjust whenever the stock or bond portion of the portfolio moves up or down by, say, 5% or more.Before making a decision as to whether a target date fund is a good investment for your needs, check the fund’s fact sheet or prospectus to find out what the fund’s stated mission is, how it is currently allocated, and what its future glide path will be.And, importantly, check the fund’s expense ratio since that will determine what you will pay in annual fees. Ideally you want an expense ratio below 0.3%, Sharick said. For example, say a fund has a 0.2% expense ratio. That means you will pay $20 in annual fees for every $10,000 you have invested (0.2% x $10,000).Beyond gathering that information, consider that the fund is designed to help “average” investors by assuming a certain risk tolerance and set of investment goals for them, which may or may not match your own, said Tampa, Florida-based certified financial planner Stacy Miller.It is especially critical in your 50s to revisit your fund’s glide path to (and possibly after) the fund’s retirement date. If you’re healthy and expect to live 20 or more years in retirement, make sure the target date fund’s planned stock allocation can generate enough growth in your portfolio for your needs and preferences.“As pre-retirees approach that retirement ‘target date’, some of these funds start shifting more to fixed income and away from equity positions altogether. Depending on the investor’s risk profile, this could be detrimental to their long-term retirement goals,” Miller said.When Minogue is helping a client figure out how best to invest their 401(k), he said he will always recommend the target date fund option if he can’t see how else the client can build out an adequately diversified stock and bond portfolio at a low cost.And in plans where target date funds are the only option, he said, “it’s a great default option.”Beyond reading the fine print on what a target fund aims to do and how it aims to do it, be honest with yourself about what type of investor you are.If you’re willing to take more risk than the average person and you’re willing to actively manage and rebalance your portfolio on your own, you may feel your money is too constrained in a target date fund.But target date funds can be a good option if you simply don’t feel confident enough – or frankly, interested enough – to actively manage your retirement savings.“If you’re an overanalyzer or overthinker, or you don’t want to worry about it, target date funds are for you,” Sharick said.",5113,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/success/target-date-funds-401k-explained/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1330234595.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,broad whack adjust overanalyzer importantly anticipate enrol meaning essentially minogue target madi appropriate quarterly detrimental feel change goal research prospectus figure note manages assume live x especially stick manage money consider thousand grow madison call make fix blend growth sheet certify stacy approach percentage income constrain conservative expect revisit high analysis assign sharick portion ratio profile confident give default automatically simply match plan date portfolio underlie bond allocation future set rebalance million person start miller client time financial exposure planner work account recommend actual hand retirement tolerance possibly accord track print overthinker gathering reading partly frankly word closest fine majority average design relative state specific equity vanguard ensure annual stock institute away expense altogether actively investment determine turn fund mission lifecycle vast aim review generate pay year benefit option offer glide manager move diversified broader ideally international chosen investor healthy sector asset data build select worry kardinal tampa low critical currently adequately anonymized decision risk pick information path great index fact instance position check find type market employer invest bryan fee allocate performance employee periodically participant due depend honest meant shift interested,0.98935,0.0586739683160571,7.790863723608442,0.4896812596006144,0,2023-12-02
CNN,Pinky Cole Hayes goes from founding Slutty Vegan to entrepreneurial reality show,2023-12-02 09:00:00,not specified,"Pinky Cole Hayes makes being nine months pregnant with her third baby, on a book tour, being a philanthropist and running a multimillion dollar business look easy.If it sounds like a lot, it is, but the founder of the meatless hamburger brand Slutty Vegan is so committed to being successful that she wants to spread that success to others as well.Cole has been serving as a judge on Revolt TV’s “Bet on Black,” a series which highlights up-and-coming Black entrepreneurs like Cole used to be.“This is my second season now and when I did it the first time, we had a ball,” she told CNN. “Then this season came back up again, and they reached out and said ‘We’d love to have Pinky on’ and I’m like ‘Okay, I’ll do it.’ Bcause obviously this is my lane, entrepreneurship, and it was a cool way to really be able to showcase my entrepreneurial expertise.”With Slutty Vegan, Cole has parlayed her past as a former producer for “The Maury Povich Show” into helming a massively successful restaurant chain.But she hasn’t stopped there.She’s also the author of “Eat Plants, B*tch: 91 Vegan Recipes That Will Blow Your Meat-Loving Mind” and the more recent “I Hope You Fail: Ten Hater Statements Holding You Back from Getting Everything You Want.”Not to mention her philanthropic work that has seen her pay off college students’ debt, and a development deal she’s working on in her hometown of Baltimore for a new retail area in a deal that’s supported by Under Armour founder Kevin Plank.“To look back at where my life has grown since 2018, I know that I’ve done a lot, but I still have a lot of work to do because I want to be the best,” she said.In that she has a great partner in her husband, Derrick Hayes, who is the founder and CEO of the extremely successful Big Dave’s Cheesesteaks.Yes – the founder of a vegan restaurant chain is married to the founder of a cheesesteak chain, but it helps that he too is committed to both his business as well as helping other entrepreneurs.Together, life can be hectic, with Hayes’ two daughters from previous relationships along with their two tots and soon-to-be third child together.Cole laughs when she mentions that she has “been pregnant since 2020” and will now have three children under the age of three. It’s been challenging, she admits.“That mom guilt came from the fact that I was always traveling, always in business meetings,” she said. “And yes, I have my village and I’ve got the people that support us holistically, but you know, I was gone a whole lot.”She said she refuses to “be less of a mom because I want to be more of an entrepreneur, or vice versa.”“Now I’ve merged both of those worlds together,” she said. “If I’m doing anything with business, nine times out of 10, you’re going to see me with my kids.”It’s all hard work, which is why Cole feels ideally suited to help advise other business owners. As Slutty Vegan is poised to open a location at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, she said she knows what it means to dream big.“To start as a mom and pop and now be recognized as a national brand in (one of) the busiest airport in the world, and the biggest airport in the world, is just a really big accomplishment,” she said. “For us to still be in a very sustainable place, considering a lot of businesses are closing their doors and we’re opening more doors, I’m just very grateful.”",3353,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/entertainment/pinky-cole-slutty-vegan-entrepreneurial-show/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231201134007-pinky-cole-slutty-vegan-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,sound national mind student cnn big grateful business ceo past pinky opening pop recipe meeting statement feel bcause daughter poise author hamburger atlanta meatless producer derrick merge consider ten back tch make philanthropic slutty married cool sustainable b dave pregnant showcase founder highlight commit baby vice hold book tv success accomplishment cheesesteak brand helm kevin series recognize dollar multimillion life run bet start season grown debt ball time plant world cole work lot advise chain fail hayes suit spread tour black stop college povich hard airport entrepreneurship successful busiest armour place closing village vegan location development blow maury hater revolt pay challenge massively dream extremely partner husband reach recent area ideally holistically love entrepreneurial philanthropist deal travel hometown guilt support entrepreneur baltimore eat great fact refuse month show owner hope age previous laugh lane mention open told serve retail former hectic parlayed judge mom restaurant relationship child,0.98225,0.0894721145243065,6.1996153846153845,0.3703094777562863,0,2023-12-02
CNN,TikTok’s recent court victories show just how hard it might be to ban the app,2023-12-02 08:41:00,Brian Fung,"A pair of back-to-back court victories for TikTok this week have threatened to make it harder for the company’s critics to clamp down on it, after a state judge in Indiana threw out one lawsuit against the popular short-form video app and a federal judge blocked a first-of-its-kind Montana law that would have banned the app statewide.Neither case has reached a final outcome. But the early-stage results in both states show that when the hot-button politics of TikTok came face-to-face with the most fundamental basics of American law, the politics lost.In both cases, efforts to crack down on TikTok failed to pass rudimentary checks such as whether they complied with the First Amendment or whether the court even had jurisdiction in the matter, according to Thursday’s rulings.Those results reveal how the state attempts to regulate TikTok “are clearly pretextual and designed for political theater,” Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, told CNN. “So when you put them in front of a non-political decisionmaker, they look ridiculous.”That the states’ could not clear even the most elemental legal hurdles highlights the challenge ahead for policymakers who are struggling to articulate a concrete problem their legal tools can solve.The two cases have different origins. The lawsuit in Indiana sought court-ordered fines and restrictions on TikTok for allegedly violating state consumer protection laws. The Montana suit was brought by TikTok and a group of content creators after the state enacted a bill, SB419, that would have prohibited the app from operating on personal electronic devices within state lines.Both cases reflected concerns expressed by government officials at all levels in the United States about TikTok’s ties to China through its parent company, ByteDance. Policymakers have alleged that Chinese intelligence laws could force ByteDance to expose TikTok’s US user data to the Chinese government, but so far US officials have not publicly presented any concrete evidence of unauthorized government data access.Calls for a TikTok ban in the US first arose during the Trump administration and have waxed and waned in the years since, but most attempts to ban the app have been challenged in court. The only government bans that have been effective at limiting TikTok have been those at the federal and state levels targeting its use on official government devices. But millions of personal devices in the United States can still freely access TikTok.All the while, TikTok has only cemented its vast and growing reach in the country. TikTok announced earlier this year that it reached the milestone 150 million monthly active users in the United States. And an increasing number of creators, small business owners and other TikTok users are now relying on the platform for their livelihoods.The dependence some creators have on TikTok makes it a direct infringement of their First Amendment rights to ban the app in Montana, District Judge Donald Molloy wrote in his opinion Thursday.“In shutting off TikTok, the Legislature has both harmed User Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights and cut off a stream of income on which many rely. Thus, Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of irreparable harm” from the law, Molloy wrote.Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project, said the Montana ruling shows how the US Constitution “imposes an extraordinarily high bar on this kind of mass censorship.”Overlooked amid the constitutional findings may be a more subtle, yet no less powerful, theme in both cases: states have tried to make a national issue into a local one and, in the process, exceeded their authority.In the Montana case, Molloy made this critique clear when he tore into the state’s stated justification for passing SB419 — that Montana had a legitimate “state interest” in protecting residents from Chinese espionage.“SB419 explicitly bans TikTok because of its direct connection to a specific foreign nation,” Molloy wrote. “[But] Montana does not have constitutional authority in the field of foreign affairs.”The Indiana ruling backs into the same conclusion, finding that even though state officials made numerous allegations that TikTok misled the public about its business practices, the state failed to prove any connection to Indiana that might give the state court jurisdiction over the company.“There are no allegations that Indiana users even heard these alleged misstatements, let alone relied on them when deciding to download and use the TikTok platform,” Judge Jennifer DeGroote wrote in her opinion.DeGroote added that just because TikTok “is available to Hoosiers through third-party app stores” does not mean the court has jurisdiction over TikTok either, “because the State does not allege that TikTok specifically targeted Indiana.”Together, the rulings lay out significant limitations on how those states can go after TikTok, constraining policymakers’ ability to target the company by way of either its ties to China or by reference to loud public criticism of the app.Ultimately, the state-level efforts in Indiana and Montana failed for many reasons, Goldman said, and policymakers should take note of this. “It’s a panoply of legal hurdles that anti-TikTok efforts must jump through, and there’s just no way to get through all of them,” he said.Because of how clear-cut and well-reasoned the judges’ opinions were on many of the core legal principles, said Blake Reid, a law professor at the University of Colorado, there was little need for them to weigh in on the central political argument at the center of the cases: Whether TikTok really is a danger to the public.“These are both judges who likely are trying to avoid wading into the political fight,” said Reid, adding that the Montana opinion in particular “is a very efficient dismantling of a high-profile, politically charged law” and uses a tight and narrow approach to reach a result “without breaking too much new ground” that might leave an opening for a successful appeal.Other courts will likely take note of the Montana injunction, said Goldman. It won’t be considered a precedent, exactly, but Molloy’s argument will be persuasive to other judges reviewing similar cases, he said. The Indiana decision is less likely to have a nationwide impact, Goldman added, simply due to the typical obscurity of state court rulings and how state laws differ from one jurisdiction to another.Rather than risk running afoul of the Constitution with TikTok-specific bans and limitations, Goldman said, policymakers should reinvigorate efforts to enhance Americans’ data privacy rights more broadly, applying uniform rules to all internet companies to prevent unauthorized access to that data by any government — Chinese or otherwise.“The fact that social media apps are a giant machine for gathering information that is of substantial interest to governments means we really need to have a social reconciliation about how do we restrict, if appropriate, the collection of data,” he said. “And, certainly, how do we restrict government access to that data.”",7145,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/02/tech/fresh-legal-blows-tiktok-ban-court-challenges/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200323133428-brian-fung-profile.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,central colorado amendment uniform national concern hoosier effective center restrict medium narrow social cnn plaintiff elemental content wan prohibit afoul tiktok number target business appropriate opening exceed theater persuasive public clamp threw director critique note foreign allegedly monthly put panoply authority ability origin tight creator consider similar attempt american grow impact back ban front make official download donald establish political typical video approach nationwide platform liberty rule china income enact constrain molloy brought tie law avoid access kind apps high fundamental highlight precedent mislead leave broadly sought stream cement trump santa overlook force earlier country popular thursday waxed subtle cut legitimate outcome announce give small clear company rely dismantle reveal reason jump harm shut simply threaten basic rudimentary conclusion criticism connection justification publicly week differ imposes express reid giant violate clara constitution mass amid run million concrete government toomey hurdle specifically present parent comply dependence store problem administration theme bill federal harder enhance intelligence district blake powerful crack level obscurity increase civil fail accord user struggle gathering tore resident suit consumer jurisdiction passing allege issue politics explicitly break nation irreparable policymakers design local lawsuit fine bytedance field state project specific decide freely heard infringement constitutional tool wad legislature protect group likelihood argument allegation privacy prove successful different restriction degroote chinese prevent charge security evidence limitation operating court protection result ahead vast write app review jennifer arose challenge fight pair internet year challenged reach final misstatement injunction union collection add reconciliation block case ruling substantial data active significant regulate reflect loud decisionmaker available critic direct electronic principle personal efficient eric lay unauthorized decision opinion risk apply information matter expose particular bar practice danger fact check show owner deputy finding find goldman weigh politically victory process milestone united montana university effort machine numerous reinvigorate told professor ground due core legal indiana extraordinarily pretextual articulate judge limit reference device interest,-0.1907499999999999,0.1679496151154653,11.83579446640316,0.3983602508602508,0,2023-12-02

I recently rewatched the video, and it holds up. Here is this bird, perched on the back of a chair. As the song opens, he appears to be sketching out his moves, getting a feel for the song. When the chorus arrives, he shrieks and grooves, he high-kicks and head-bangs, settling into his rhythm, possessed by the beat.The video of Snowball is astonishing because of how humanlike he is. Look, an animal moving spontaneously to the music, just like we do! Or, rather, just like we can. We can dance, but how often do we, really?

Washington Post,Employees keep up pressure on Big Tech to drop deal with Israel,2023-12-02 06:00:00,Caroline O'Donovan,"More than 100 Amazon employees in 20 cities gathered to eat knafeh and observe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, but in two offices, the event was interrupted by fliers that said “KIDNAPPED” above photos of Israeli hostages.Employees attending Wednesday’s celebration “felt like they were being intimidated,” said an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his job.The incident followed weeks of rising tension between members of Amazon’s Arab employee resource group, who have been pushing the company to drop a cloud computing contract with Israel and express support for Palestinian employees, and staffers in Tel Aviv and those who support Israel.When Israel began bombing Gaza more than seven weeks ago, a two-year-old campaign against Google and Amazon’s contract with the Israeli government was reinvigorated. On Friday, more than 1,700 Amazon employees presented CEO Andy Jassy with a petition calling for the company to “rescind all contracts with the Israeli military and call for an immediate, durable, and sustained cease-fire.” While that’s a small fraction of Amazon’s total workforce of more than 1 million, employees say the pro-Palestine momentum in corporate America is a significant shift in the face of the U.S. tech industry’s strong business ties to Israel. It reflects a broader trend among Americans, who have increasingly called for President Biden to put an end to the violence in Gaza.“I’ve been seeing a lot more solidarity and sympathy even among people who are not traditionally political,” said the Amazon employee.On Thanksgiving, Jassy wrote an email to employees in which he acknowledged for the first time both “lost lives in Israel and Palestine.”“It’s troubling to see hate spreading around the world the way it has the last several weeks,” the message seen by The Washington Post said. “Nothing good can come of the hate that we are witnessing.”Some of that hate is popping up within Amazon’s ranks. An Amazon employee in London shared photos of office elevators with “Free Palestine” written on them. Another employee said they received messages saying Israel would only stop bombing Gaza when the hostages were returned, according to screenshots seen by The Post.And a third employee wrote in a post to the Jewish affinity Slack channel seen by The Post that most of Gaza’s residents “support terror” and that “no peace is possible with such animals.”“There’s such tension between Arabs and Jewish employees right now,” one employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their job told The Post. “That’s very palpable.”Amazon has hundreds of employees in Tel Aviv, some of whom have been called up to fight with the Israel Defense Forces in the past few months, which is adding to the tension among employees.“We don’t tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind in the workplace,” Amazon spokesman Rob Munoz wrote in an email statement. “We investigate all reported incidents of such behavior and take appropriate action against any employee who is found to have violated our policies, up to and including termination.”(Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Interim CEO Patty Stonesifer sits on Amazon’s board.)Amazon and Google jointly won Israel’s Project Nimbus cloud computing contract in April 2021. In October of that year, employees from both companies participating in a campaign called No Tech for Apartheid, wrote in a public letter that the contract “was signed the same week that the Israeli military attacked Palestinians in the Gaza Strip — killing nearly 250 people, including more than 60 children” and in fear that the “technology our companies have contracted to build will make the systematic discrimination and displacement carried out by the Israeli military and government even crueler and deadlier for Palestinians.”At the time, 300 Amazon employees signed the anti-Nimbus letter. Two years later, that number has grown more than five times.“Last time it took a week,” said an employee involved in organizing the No Tech For Apartheid campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their job. “This literally took overnight.”Staffers who oppose the Nimbus deal have also been trying to figure out exactly what the project is. A news release from 2023 suggests the cloud computing contract does include the Israel Defense Forces, the same military forces that have been bombing Gaza, The Intercept reported.But the contract is secret, and employees said they still don’t know exactly what they’re contributing to. Google previously declined to comment on the contract.In the petition signed by 1,700 Amazon employees, they say that “by providing a cloud ecosystem for the Israeli public sector, Amazon is bolstering the artificial intelligence and surveillance capabilities of the Israeli military used to repress Palestinian activists and impose a brutal siege on Gaza.”Regarding the petition, Amazon spokesperson Munoz said the company ""is focused on making the benefits of our world-leading cloud technology available to all our customers, wherever they are located.”Much of the organizing against Nimbus at Amazon has taken place in a Slack channel for Arab employees. As support for their cause has mounted, those employees say harassment from co-workers who disagree with them has increased.Despite this, employees came together in less than a week to organize the solidarity day event, which included videos from Palestinian employees talking about their families and the meaning of freedom. But tensions spilled over with the fliers, and also one employee tried to record the event on their phone and argue with the employees attending the event.For now, the Arab employees said they will continue to demand more information about the cloud contract and assurances it isn’t being used for military purposes.",5871,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/02/amazon-israel-gaza-war/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,corporate make present board crueler palestinian arab spill cloud begin kill trouble activist jeff apartheid build biden told past employee significant jassy comment amazon decline figure suggests celebration child compute google news statement write action petition push observe spoke slack behavior protect put wednesday job group phone anonymity displacement strong staffer spokesman increasingly stonesifer member possible total customer military lot week strip brutal surveillance tolerate office siege traditionally add stop public violence secret sign share place reinvigorate lose nimbus defense interrupt april gather knafeh workforce meaning deadlier kidnap solidarity attend policy city provide terror kind support participate continue focus grown video spread condition freedom discrimination israel eat october industry deal disagree million receive organize carry flier shift bombing violate america company palestine president government regard event sympathy rescind resident appropriate workplace systematic day photo peace hate hostage gaza include repress elevator israeli acknowledge aviv fraction attack founder munoz international spokesperson patty literally intimidate ago found sector free time interim tech number durable artificial tel investigate technology previously force message fight mount small tension accord bezos contribute trend world report information political ecosystem immediate rise thanksgiving pop call rob year fear harassment intercept sits follow channel assurance drop hundred capability oppose andy available affinity release benefit broader record campaign ceo rank resource intelligence bolster impose business email return momentum involve contract argue reflect washington american jewish post felt family purpose express incident project month letter friday talk tie demand screenshots life jointly sustain london,-0.87735,0.1532958610117526,11.017769447047796,0.3867319508448542,0,2023-12-02

Fox News,North Dakota maternity home for crisis pregnancies celebrates 20th anniversary with over 150 babies born,2023-12-02 04:15:00,Christine Rousselle,"A maternity home in North Dakota is celebrating its 20th anniversary, as its founder reflects on the hundreds of women and children she has helped over the years.Mary Pat Jahner of Warsaw, North Dakota, was working as a Catholic school teacher when she was inspired to change the course of her life dramatically — and change the lives of hundreds of others eventually as well.After each school year ended, Jahner would spend her summers volunteering with groups such as the Missionaries of Charity. One summer, after volunteering at the Missionaries of Charity's maternity home in California, Jahner ""kind of fell in love with that work,"" she told Fox News Digital.PENNSYLVANIA NONPROFIT IS DEDICATED TO HELPING PREGNANT WOMEN AVOID ABORTION'S ‘HOPELESSNESS’""And through a whole turn of events that really started in the Jubilee Year 2000, I decided, 'Why don't we have something like that here?

(Saint Gianna & Pietro Molla Maternity Home)Built in a converted convent, the St. Gianna & Pietro Molla Maternity Home was initially named after the then-Blessed Gianna Beretta Molla.Molla was an Italian pediatrician who turned down doctors' advice to abort her child after she developed a complication during her pregnancy, said the Vatican's website.She died on April 28, 1962, a week after the safe delivery of her fourth child, also named Gianna. She was canonized in 2004 by St. Pope John Paul II.""Obviously, if they need to come to a maternity home, not everything is perfect in their life.""Molla is the patroness of doctors, mothers, wives, families and the unborn.NORTH DAKOTA MILLENNIAL WOMAN ADVANCES TOWARD SAINTHOOD AFTER THE 'HEROIC SANCTITY' OF HER CANCER BATTLESt. Gianna was ""a model for my students,"" Jahner told Fox News Digital — as she was a modern woman, not a nun, who achieved sainthood.Molla ""really sacrificed a lot for her child,"" she said. ""And so does every mom who comes here, really.""Said Jahner, ""They're sacrificing, they're making hard choices because, obviously, if they need to come to a maternity home, not everything is perfect in their life. And so she was the perfect patron here.""A woman holds a photo of St. Gianna Beretta Molla, a physician who opted against abortion in 1962 and died due to complications after the safe delivery of her child.

They come from all over the country, from all walks of life — and many are from a nearby Native American reservation.The youngest resident the home has had was 12 years old — the oldest, 39. There is no charge for any of the services.""A lot of [the moms] are either really young or really have fallen on some hard times and are kind of alone in the world,"" said Jahner.Children who are younger than first grade are welcome to live in the home with their mothers as well.The home's name was changed to include Pietro Molla about a year and a half ago, said Mary Pat Jahner. Over 150 babies have been born at the home.

At Saint Gianna & Pietro Molla Maternity Home, we believe every unborn child is a gift from God and has a right to life, and every pregnant woman has the right to give birth with dignity.""In addition to prenatal care, the Gianna Home provides for the residents' emotional, educational and spiritual needs. Some residents are still in high school when they arrive; others opt to pursue professional certifications.Residents of any faith are welcome to live at the home, but Sunday Mass attendance is mandatory, as is evening prayer and prayer before meals.Jahner also works to set moms up for success after their children are born, offering assistance in finding a job, an apartment or both.""A lot of times, you pay that first month's rent for them,"" she said.INDIANA POLICE OFFICER AND HIS WIFE ADOPT INFANT GIRL ABANDONED IN ‘BABY BOX’The connections to the home do not end when the baby is born.

This year, three former residents will be coming for Christmas.Roughly a quarter of the women who live at the home opt to place their children up for adoption, Jahner said.The remainder choose to parent their children themselves.A single woman, Jahner told Fox News Digital that she did not think she would have children of her own — although she considers herself the grandmother of the children born at the home.She is, however, a mom to three: Kassity, Geianna and Aubrey.Geianna, Aubrey and Kassity (from left to right) are all Jahner's children. Geianna and Aubrey were born at the Saint Gianna & Pietro Molla Maternity Home; Kassity is Geianna's older sister.

Washington Post,Ask Amy: How do I explain that I’m not working for mental health reasons?,2023-12-02 00:00:00,Amy Dickinson,"Dear Amy: I am a woman in my mid-40s with two grown children. I have suffered with depression and anxiety for much of my life. I am on medication and work weekly with a therapist. Things have been under control until recently.Over the past few months my mother had a stroke, my husband had a heart attack and one of my children called off their wedding. I handled everything as it was happening, but once everything settled, I had a bit of a breakdown. I took some time off work to attend to my mental health. When I returned, I was pretty much told I was no longer needed at the company. I was very hurt, but in reality it was probably time for me to move on.My husband and I talked and decided that I didn’t need to be in a hurry to return to work. We realized that we could more than make it on his salary and I still wasn’t in a great place mentally. My therapist didn’t think I was ready to return to work and definitely not in a place to start a new job.Being home, I’ve been accomplishing a lot of things we had been putting off due to lack of time and energy. Our home is very happy and very clean! However, I struggle to respond when people ask about my work.When I tell people I don’t work, there’s always an implied question as to why. My children are grown and I’m not disabled, so what do I say when the questions get personal?— Young & Happy RetireeHappy: Your history of mental illness might have sensitized you to questions about your situation, but I’ll offer a gentle reminder that taking care of your mental health is nothing to be embarrassed about. All the same, no one should feel forced to reveal their health history, just to fulfill a conversation-starter.Also, by the way, you do work. You are taking care of hearth and home.I suggest a friendly but vague response: “I left my previous job not too long ago and I'm taking a break until I start my next chapter. In fact, this might be my next chapter, because I love working at home.”Dear Amy: My wonderful daughter is soon to have her first child. She and her husband, “Jackson” moved to a community not far from his mother. My husband and I live much farther away.The mother-in-law has a very big personality and often demands attention (especially after a cocktail or three). Our relationship is not exactly warm but is definitely cordial.My worry is that when I visit my daughter and the new baby, the mother-in-law will come over and “suck all the oxygen” out of the room. She is an attention-seeker, and all I’ll really want is time with my daughter and the baby.Am I wrong to want this? My daughter is in the precarious position of trying to be warm and welcoming, and while she is capable of setting boundaries, this may not be her fight. Any advice?— Trying to do it RightTrying: My first piece of advice is that you shouldn’t buy a problem before they’re on sale.Your assumptions about the dynamic might turn out to be entirely correct, but entering the family system worrying mainly about what you won’t get (enough alone time with your daughter and grandchild) might not be best for your daughter right now. You are not wrong to want undivided attention. That’s what most of us want. But of course the real joy of grandparenting is to give attention.One boundary your daughter should establish immediately is that her mother-in-law should not pop in unannounced. You could try to telegraph your expectations in advance of your visit by telling your daughter, “I assume I’ll see Jackson’s mother while I’m visiting, but I hope that I can also enjoy some family time with just you, Jackson and baby.”Dear Amy: I appreciated your response to “J,” who is helping plan a 50th high school reunion, and sought your opinion on including the daughter of a deceased class member.As a bereaved mother, I especially liked your suggestion that other family members of the deceased, including parents, be invited. There isn’t a day that we don’t remember and miss our loved one who died too soon. It is a comfort to hear their name said aloud and know that they are remembered.— Peggy in ElmiraPeggy: Absolutely.",4085,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/12/02/ask-amy-mental-health-quit-working/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make happy correct amy pretty opinion jackson reminder dear advice medication therapist past told probably left definitely wonderful grandparenting unannounced suck personality worry advance assume child salary righttrying love grandchild fact sensitize class reveal especially put sought visit elmirapeggy job ready heart disabled suffer member young decease dynamic lot control joy give stroke cocktail plan room embarrass place welcome wedding decide break piece daughter attend school miss remember hear grown longer buy feel depression entirely move imply big establish handle history capable weekly company energy clean relationship vague mental home comfort day great peggy personal include expectation community precarious baby hearth chapter boundary attack mentally appreciate realize struggle ago reality hurry wrong hurt previous time set happen due retireehappy force response parent health fight aloud work attention breakdown farther course enter woman pop call settle telegraph question long absolutely respond bereave lack real bit suggestion problem fulfill husband immediately hope assumption high position mother situation suggest accomplish system invite enjoy return anxiety live friendly oxygen illness family offer gentle turn month reunion undivided talk start demand life warm,0.98535,0.0,6.19207459207459,0.4660021988593416,0,2023-12-02
Washington Post,Miss Manners: Friend’s mom keeps comparing our kids,2023-12-02 00:00:00,Judith Martin,"Dear Miss Manners: I am the mother of a terrific 15-year-old girl. She’s a joy to be around, has lovely friends, does fine in school, is both interesting and interested, etc.I may be prejudiced, so I’ll name some flaws, as well: She frequently needs to be reminded about chores, she’ll sleep late, can be forgetful, and now and then there’s drama and arguments over rules. But I’m not writing for help with those. I need advice about the mother of one of her friends.This is a relatively small town, so my “Hannah” has known her friend “Chloe” since grade school, and I’ve known her mother “Amelia” peripherally for almost as long. We’re not close friends, but we are good for a chat when our paths cross.Hannah and Chloe have been thrown together a fair amount recently, in classes and a summer program, with Amelia and I arranging a carpool. So Hannah has been running into Amelia more during drop-offs, pickups and quick visits.This is where the problem comes in: Amelia rarely passes up an opportunity to compare the two girls — in both of their hearing. If Hannah were coming off worse in these comparisons, at least I’d know how to tell her to defend herself. Instead, Amelia holds Hannah out as an example.She’ll tell Chloe, “Hannah got an A on her biology test. Why can’t you study like she does?” (Hannah does like biology and did well in that class.) Or, “Hannah’s room is so clean. You should learn from her.” (Yes, her room was clean that day, but it isn’t always.) Or, “See how nice and polite Hannah is?” (Hannah is polite to most people, especially a friend’s parent, but it’s not like Chloe is a horror. She’s just an awkward teenager.)Chloe gets tight-lipped listening to these comparisons, and Hannah sort of hangs her head. I don’t want to encourage Hannah to put herself down, nor to contradict Amelia, but both girls are uncomfortable when this happens. I don’t like the idea of anything coming between these two girls, who otherwise get along fine.How should we handle this?Encourage Hannah to speak up for Chloe, enthusiastically mentioning accomplishments that her friend has achieved.It does not have to be the same things, only things that will boost Chloe’s confidence and, Miss Manners hopes, point out to her mother the damage of making comparisons.Dear Miss Manners: My 11-year-old granddaughter wants to register online for birthday gifts for her party. I told her I didn’t think that was appropriate, especially for 11-year-olds.By doing so, she is telling her friends how much they need to spend and depriving them of the fun of choosing a special gift for her. Plus, it just seems tacky. Am I old-fashioned?You may tell your granddaughter that the equally old-fashioned Miss Manners says that registering for presents — at any age and for any occasion — is rude.Starting this young will only lead her friends to retail exhaustion — or worse, resentment from their parents when their children get the bright idea to do the same.New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Washington Post,"Carolyn Hax: Even when they talk, husband’s no longer paying attention",2023-12-02 00:00:00,Carolyn Hax,"Adapted from an online discussion.Dear Carolyn: My husband rarely asks how I’m doing, or asks about my work, or shows interest in my interests. On the rare occasion he does ask, he’ll be distracted in some way on his phone or just not fully paying attention. He makes this obvious with comments unrelated to what I’ve shared and his lack of eye contact. Sometimes he will interrupt me when I’m responding.I’ve voiced my observations and said we don’t need to talk since you’re on your phone, etc. We are in counseling for (none other than) communication.I’m frustrated and know I cannot change him, but I’m not sure how else I can handle this on my end.— HelloooHellooo: I’m sorry. Your options are limited by his willingness to change how he treats you, but you can draw lines on how you are treated: “Would you please put your phone away while we talk?” Ask in advance for distraction-free time, like a dinner out where you put your phones away, or a walk around the neighborhood.Even as I type this, I find it painful — it just feels wrong to advise how to socially engineer attention to you and away from a chirping box. But there are two powerful forces at work here: 1. A long relationship with a normal decline in novelty. 2. Technology built on teasing and tempting brains with unlimited novelty, or simulations thereof. With some neurological profiles, the pull to phones is much stronger than it is for other people, but everyone is susceptible to a degree; like Jessica Rabbit, phones were just drawn that way.It may be that your husband’s pull to distractions and away from you is too strong for your marriage to overcome. But you have the right ideas for pulling back, so put them to use more decisively. Insist on his attention at the times you want his attention. Set up no-phone zones. Keep working at the intimacy of truth.And consider reintroducing novelty. When couples are dating, they make cool plans — then, too often, let that slide when they marry. When did you last plan to do something new?Dear Carolyn: My husband of 23 years and I have realized we don’t have much trust in each other or our relationship anymore. I don’t mean in the traditional sense, where we think there is cheating, but trust in the sense that we want the best for each other, and have good intentions that sometimes go awry by accident rather than through purposeful neglect.We are struggling to build better trust because the distrust always gets in the way. Any advice? We’ve tried therapy several times, but it’s never stuck.— AnonymousAnonymous: What are the consequences of being wrong about trusting each other?Meaning, what if you made a conscious, mutual decision to give each other the benefit of the doubt? On purpose, every time, unfounded, just because, till it resets your habits.If there’s harm involved, then this won’t work. Otherwise, the only risk is that you might be more generous to each other than you deserve, vs. less. Great, right? Just agree to take each other’s word upfront, then live with it for a while.Reader says:",3044,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/12/02/carolyn-hax-husband-ignores-me/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make handle relationship tempt unlimited draw hellooohellooo back powerful susceptible find pull simulation reset upfront idea dear build advice drawn great obvious contact limited deserve word away jessica reintroduce comment harm decline realize thereof struggle distrust doubt carolyn option line advance wrong therapy interest time trust set technology consider insist show purposeful unfounded rarely anonymousanonymous force fully willingness advise rabbit accident conscious socially put work attention dinner phone risk generous strong distraction change overcome neurological walk brain year long give adapt observation novelty lack treat date occasion plan husband decisively normal benefit intimacy share type pay interrupt unrelated intention cheat agree meaning awry built box distract zone frustrate live marry rare involve voiced couple traditional cool online eye painful consequence anymore tease mutual profile marriage purpose chirp feel slide talk degree sorry decision engineer counsel asks,0.2447,0.0985545335085413,6.274733542319751,0.5130716175359031,0,2023-12-02
MSNBC,Beyoncé’s ‘Renaissance’ movie launches Blue Ivy’s stardom into space,2023-12-01 23:22:00,Evette Dionne,"Beyoncé Knowles-Carter is, undoubtedly, the brightest star in our musical galaxy, and she once again proved it with the release of her concert film “Renaissance.” The 3-hour film combines spellbinding footage from stops on her record-breaking “Renaissance” tour with intimate, behind-the-scenes snippets that contextualize how the tour came to be, the nonstop work needed to make her excellence look effortless, and the hope and joy Beyoncé aims to imprint on every concert attendee. The film offers a rare peek into the superstar’s ultraprivate world, where she is the maestro — responsible for every element of a stadium tour — and a student learning alongside the people she’s brought along the “Renaissance” journey. The film also chronicles the ascension of another star in Beyoncé’s orbit: Blue Ivy Carter, the 11-year-old daughter she shares with rap titan Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter. The film also chronicles the ascension of another star in Beyoncé’s orbit: Blue Ivy Carter, the 11-year-old daughter she shares with rap titan Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter. We’ve been witnesses to Blue Ivy’s journey, from the moment Beyoncé announced her pregnancy on a stage at MTV’s VMA Awards, but this film spotlights her stepping into her own, defining herself for herself and learning herself along the way. At first, her megastar parents were hesitant about allowing their daughter to perform. “I did not think it was an appropriate place for an 11-year-old on the stadium stage,” Beyoncé says in the film. “All of the things I’ve had to go through, the obstacles I’ve had to overcome, prepared me. She hasn’t had that struggle.” However, Beyoncé eventually relented, cutting a deal with Blue Ivy that if she rehearsed diligently with the tour’s other dancers, then she’d allow her to perform — once. When Blue Ivy rose from the stage’s lift in Paris on May 26 to dance alongside her mother to a medley of “My Power,” Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” and “Black Parade,” it stunned the world. The child the Beyhive has jokingly called “the next Supreme” and “Beyoncé’s manager” was taking her rightful place on the world stage, declaring herself as the next heir to the Knowles-Carter musical kingdom. However, the reception to Blue Ivy’s first stage appearance wasn’t completely positive. It’s hard being the child of two of the world’s most famous artists, and people put a lot of pressure on the 11-year-old to perform as flawlessly as her mother does. Some of the criticism was cruel, which is likely not new for a child who’s been facing scrutiny since birth, but we see in the film that rather than shy away from the pressure, Blue Ivy let the criticisms of her performance fuel her instead. She rehearsed even harder and persuaded her parents to allow her to continue to perform. “When Blue Ivy started practicing and practicing and basically saying, ‘I’ll show you,’ that’s a Knowles right there,” Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé’s father and one of the architects of her career, says in the film. “That’s a Knowles right there.” Beyoncé agreed, noting in the film that “Blue comes up fighting against the negativity that was put on her just because she was our kid. She was ready to take back her power.” And, indeed, she did. When Blue Ivy stepped on the stage at the show I attended in Las Vegas, the crowd screamed its support to her, and she soaked it up. She radiated confidence as she led the dancers down the ramp at the center of the stage, hit every dance move with ease and showcased her playful personality through her facial expressions. When we collectively shouted “Blue, Blue, Blue” at the end of her section of the show, she removed one of the earbuds performers wear to hear the music and seemed genuinely shocked at the amount of love she received. Her mother is already a legend, an icon in a class singularly her own, and yet she’s unintimidated performing before 50,000; 60,000 and sometimes 70,000 people. That confidence is the dream for Black girls, who deserve to be loved, to be protected, to be encouraged to embrace their talents, and to be given every tool available to pursue their dreams. “I feel like now, my mindset has changed,” Blue Ivy says in the film. “Now, I have to actually wake up in the morning and go to rehearsal. I have to actually work hard.” What she will likely realize, as she ages though, is that no amount of fame and wealth can protect her from a world that insists on tearing Black girls and Black women down. Even her mother, the most-awarded artist in Grammys history, faces that pressure simply because of who she is. As Beyoncé recounts in the film, she’s encountered obstacle after obstacle in her career of two decades, and even now, when she’s ascended to the top of the music industry, she’s still fighting for the modicum of respect she’s earned. “Communicating as a Black woman,” she says, “everything is a fight.” Throughout the film, we watch people she’s hired to handle different parts of the show doubt her knowledge or declare that something that she already knows is possible isn’t. She gazes at them with a look that reads, “Do you know who you’re talking to?” and even that isn’t enough to make them back down. She’s still doubted, still treated as if her career is a matter of luck and not competence. “Eventually, they realize this bitch will not give up,” she declares. Who would want to subject their child to that extreme of being doubted at every turn? Beyoncé and Jay-Z said they didn’t want to, but instead they trusted their Black child to chart her own future. It does the heart good to watch a Black family, especially one with as much fame and wealth as the Knowles-Carter family, insulate their Black girl child until she was ready to step into her power, and then, once she declared that she was, surround her with the right people, imbue her with confidence and set her up to succeed. If life is but a dream, then that is the dream for every Black girl who has a vision for herself. Blue Ivy is charting the course for the next generation, just as her mother once did for those of us who’ve watched her career. Destiny fulfilled.

Reuters,Fact Check: Iceland has not banned COVID vaccines,2023-12-01 21:41:00,not specified,"A headline shared online falsely claims that Iceland has banned COVID-19 vaccines and cites sudden deaths for which there is no evidence, according to the Icelandic national health authority.Iceland has not banned COVID vaccines and “there are no soaring sudden deaths,” Guðrún Aspelund, chief epidemiologist at the Icelandic Directorate of Health, told Reuters in a Nov. 29 email.Social media posts on platform X (archived), formerly Twitter, and on Facebook (archived) from Nov. 25, 2023, shared the headline from the “Newsaddicts” website, which in turn credits a Nov. 20 blog post as its source for saying the shots were banned.However, no such announcement of a ban can be found on the Directorate of Health of Iceland’s website and no reliable independent news reporting supports the claim.Iceland is currently using the newly updated vaccine Comirnaty XBB.1.5/Pfizer, Aspelund said, adding that COVID vaccination for 2023 fall/winter is “recommended for those with medical indications, including all individuals 60 years of age and older, individuals 5 years and older with underlying conditions or as recommended by their physician, as well as healthcare workers.”The blog post suggesting that COVID vaccines were ""removed"" offers no evidence other than quoting (archived) a Nov. 17 Icelandic newspaper article, which the blog translates as saying: “Next week, the public will be able to get an influenza vaccination at the health center, but not Covid vaccination at the moment.”In response to a request for comment sent by direct message, the blog post author said: ""I don't know who makes the claim that Iceland is banning covid EUA countermeasures, in my substack article I described precisely what was announced in Iceland and provided clarifications made by my friend, the local journalist who called health officials.""In 2021, Iceland along with other Scandinavian countries temporarily discontinued giving some COVID vaccines to younger adults. But the Health Directorate said in a May 1, 2023, statement that two updated bivalent vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty and Moderna's Spikevax, will be available to adults for primary vaccinations.As of Oct. 5, 80.5% of the population (archived) in Iceland has received the primary course, that is two doses of a COVID vaccine.

CNN,Macaulay Culkin celebrated by ‘Home Alone’ mom Catherine O’Hara at his Walk of Fame ceremony,2023-12-01 21:22:00,Dan Heching,"He’s the boy who was left to his own devices in everyone’s favorite holiday comedy, and on Friday he got some recognition in Hollywood.Macaulay Culkin, star of ’90s classics “Home Alone” and “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” among many other titles, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this week. There to congratulate him was his onscreen mom from the beloved franchise, Catherine O’Hara.O’Hara – who famously realized she left her son “Kevin!” home while on a plane to France for Christmas in the 1990 Chris Columbus and John Hughes movie – said on Friday that the reason “Home Alone” was and is so beloved is because of Culkin.“It is Macaulay’s perfect performance as Kevin McAllister that gave us that little everyboy on an extraordinary adventure,” she said.“I know you worked really hard,” O’Hara continued, “but you made acting look like the most natural thing in the world to do.”As Culkin stood beside her, looking suave while decked out in wayfarer shades and a double-breasted black suit, O’Hara got choked up as she called him “the dearest thing.”She also made reference to the crushing popularity of the films and how that sudden stardom could have proven to be too much for Culkin, but credited his sense of humor as what helped him persevere.“It’s a sign of intelligence in a child, and a key to surviving life at any age,” O’Hara observed, adding, “from what I see, you have brought that sense of sweet, yet twisted, yet totally relatable sense of humor to everything that you have chosen to do since ‘Home Alone.’”“Thank you for including me, your fake mom who left you home alone not once, but twice, to share in this happy occasion,” O’Hara concluded. “I’m so proud of you.”Also in attendance at the ceremony on Friday were Culkin’s partner Brenda Song, siblings Rory Culkin and Quinn Culkin, and friends Paris Jackson and Seth Green.

Reuters,Fact Check: FCC guidelines on profanity do not apply to cable networks,2023-12-01 20:21:00,not specified,"(Editor’s note: Profanity warning in paragraph two and three)Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidelines do not prohibit indecent and profane content on cable television, despite online posts sharing a CNBC clip of Elon Musk using an expletive and claiming the news network violated FCC rules for airing the interview.The posts refer to a New York Times DealBook Summit interview on Nov. 29 with Musk saying “Go fuck yourself” to advertisers pulling out from his social media platform X over antisemitic content.A post (archived) on X social media said: “Elon saying ‘Go fuck yourself’ live on CNBC and them not expecting it, so there was no profanity delay, and therefore it violated FCC guidelines means CNBC gets fined. Hilarious.” An identical post (archived) was shared on Facebook.The FCC’s website includes definitions for obscene, indecent and profane content.A three-pronged test on the FCC’s website can render content obscene, including it appealing to “an average person's prurient interest,” it describing sexual conduct in a way that is “patently offensive,” and lacking artistic, literary, political or scientific or other value.Indecent content is defined by the FCC as a portrayal of sexual or excretory organs or activities in an offensive manner without meeting the obscenity test.Profane content includes “grossly offensive” language considered a public nuisance.Obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment and is therefore prohibited on cable, satellite and broadcast TV and radio.Indecency and profanity are prohibited on broadcast media during specific times when children may be watching, as listed by the FCC, but are not prohibited on cable or satellite.Unlike broadcast, “the same rules for indecency and profanity do not apply to cable, satellite TV and satellite radio because they are subscription services,” the site says.Broadcast television programs have previously been found to be violating FCC guidelines airing indecency or profanity. For example, broadcast news network NBC’s airing of what the FCC referred to as the “F-Word” during the Golden Globe Awards in 2003 was concluded as a violation of its guidelines on indecent and profane content (See paragraphs #2 and #4).NBC is a broadcast network while CNBC is a cable network. Both are under the NBC Universal umbrella, owned by Comcast.A spokesperson for the FCC directed Reuters to the same guidance page on its website.“FCC rules on profanity don't apply to utterances on cable networks,” former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a reply to an ABC7 Chicago reporter requesting clarification under the circulating post on X.The clip of Musk’s remarks was shared following the live interview on the CNBC website and its Facebook page with the expletive being censored both on video and in the text of the reports.",2814,https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/fcc-guidelines-profanity-do-not-apply-cable-networks-2023-12-01/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NLQ7MXUABVEYFDRCLBVKAPALSE.jpeg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,utterance tv site violate subscription average cnbc reply expletive guidance reuters facebook universal radio pull render conduct expect grossly scientific warn broadcast amendment nbc include activity obscene satellite content patently spokesperson platform cable profane rule advertiser commission apply found globe reporter chairman child violation news interest television network time offensive circulate censor refer consider previously clip portrayal meeting identical literary remark social describe excretory protect fcc delay report fin political chicago air website editor obscenity sexual define former summit follow lack musk paragraph request public award test federal share page antisemitic text service clarification program definition person dealbook guideline direct profanity prohibit organ ajit archive medium artistic prurient umbrella live watch claim despite fuck list post golden language online interview x specific video communication appeal conclude indecent note elon manner indecency york,-0.90165,0.2132196162046908,11.5996837944664,0.3507856341189673,0,2023-12-01
CNN,Felicity Huffman on college admissions scandal: ‘I had to give my daughter a chance at a future’,2023-12-01 18:42:00,Jay Croft,"Actress Felicity Huffman has opened up about her role in a college admissions scandal that landed her in federal prison, telling CNN affiliate KABC that “it felt like I had to give my daughter a chance at a future … which meant I had to break the law.”The Emmy-winning “Desperate Housewives” star was among 33 wealthy parents arrested in Operation Varsity Blues and accused of conspiring to get their children into college.She was accused of paying $15,000 to the scam’s mastermind to raise her daughter’s SAT scores. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.“And I know hindsight is 20/20 but it felt like I would be a bad mother if I didn’t do it,” Huffman told KABC on Thursday. “So – I did it.”Huffman told KABC she is ashamed of what she did, and she apologized to “the students and the families that sacrifice and work really hard to get to where they are going legitimately.”Huffman was accused of paying $15,000 to the scam’s mastermind to raise her daughter’s SAT scores. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.“And I know hindsight is 20/20 but it felt like I would be a bad mother if I didn’t do it,” Huffman told KABC. “So – I did it.”Huffman was sentenced in September 2019 to 14 days in prison, a year of probation and 250 hours of community service. She was fined $30,000.Her husband, actor William H. Macy, was not charged.Admissions consultant Rick Singer was sentenced in January 2023 to 3 1/2 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $10 million for receiving money from parents to inflate test scores and bribe school authorities.Huffman said she had second thoughts as she drove her daughter to take the test.“She was going, ‘Can we get ice cream afterwards? I’m scared about the test. What can we do that’s fun?’” Huffman said. “And I kept thinking, turn around, just turn around. And to my undying shame, I didn’t.”Huffman performed her community service with a non-profit organization called A New Way of Life. It helps women who have been incarcerated with housing, clothing and job training.“Well, I thought we would bring her in and put her at a desk and have her work in the office. And she said, ‘No, I want to do real work,’” founder Susan Burton said. “She went jogging down Central Avenue in South LA and created exercise classes for the women.”Huffman also helped the group organize its donations, Burton said. She has now joined the organization’s board of directors.“I want to use my experience and what I’ve gone through and the pain to bring something good, which is to shine a light on the organization,” Huffman said.“Felicity Huffman is one of the most beautiful people I’ve met in my lifetime,” Burton said. “And I know she has had a hiccup.

ABC,Movie armorer in 'Rust' fatal shooting pleads not guilty to unrelated gun charge,2023-12-01 18:34:00,The Associated Press,"SANTA FE, N.M. -- The weapons supervisor on the film set where Alec Baldwin shot and killed a cinematographer in 2021 waived her arraignment in a separate case, pleading not guilty to a charge of carrying a gun into a Santa Fe bar.Hannah Gutierrez-Reed had been set to appear in court next week on the charge, but a state courts spokesperson said Friday that her attorneys opted instead to waive her appearance. Her attorneys did not immediately respond to a message that The Associated Press left Friday seeking comment.The firearm charge against Gutierrez-Reed stems from an incident days before she was hired to work as the armorer on “Rust.” According to court records, a witness told authorities that she was carrying a gun when she walked into a bar in downtown Santa Fe.Gutierrez-Reed also is awaiting trial on charges of involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering stemming from the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal on the “Rust” movie set on Oct. 21, 2021.As part of their preparation for trial, special prosecutors have issued subpoenas for documents from producers of “Rust” and any audio and video recordings held by a Los Angeles film production company that might include Baldwin on the set or his comments about the film elsewhere.Legal experts have said prosecutors could repurpose documents or records uncovered in case against Gutierrez-Reed if a grand jury were to indict Baldwin.",1439,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/movie-armorer-rust-fatal-shooting-pleads-guilty-unrelated-105321894,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,expert jury tamper weapon company waive involuntary hutchins court opt gun armorer recording instead issue walk await kill seek document week associate film baldwin arraignment trial respond press fatal cinematographer day downtown stem told left include charge special comment case immediately record fe manslaughter indict witness hire authority rehearsal spokesperson producer evidence rust attorney alec uncovered audio preparation santa state bar production shot repurpose part movie plead grand set guilty supervisor shoot appearance message subpoena halyna video held separate work accord incident firearm prosecutor friday angeles carry,-0.8308500000000001,0.2084781097984711,12.693765182186231,0.4285714285714285,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,"Teen found hidden camera in American Airlines jet lavatory, suit says",2023-12-01 18:11:00,Amber Ferguson,"The parents of a 14-year-old girl are suing American Airlines after they say a male flight attendant hid his cellphone to secretly film their daughter in the bathroom aboard a flight in September from Charlotte to Boston.During the Sept. 2 flight, the lawsuit alleges that a flight attendant used tape to affix an iPhone to the toilet lid and started recording right before the North Carolina teen entered the restroom.The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina on Friday, says the airline “knew or should have known the flight attendant was a danger.” Other crew members failed to confiscate the employee’s phone after the girl complained about the incident, the complaint stated, which allowed him time to destroy the alleged evidence.John Robert Buric, the attorney representing the girl’s family, said the incident was “exacerbated by the fact that the actions complained of were perpetrated by someone the airlines hired to protect this young girl.”“In the three months since the incident occurred, no one from American Airlines has bothered to reach out or check on my client’s well-being. This must never be allowed to happen again,” Buric said Friday.In a statement, American Airlines said, “We take this matter very seriously and have been fully cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation, as safety and security are our highest priorities.”The airline said the flight attendant has not worked since the incident was reported, but did not respond to questions about whether they were still employed by the company.The alleged incident occurred midflight as the teen and her family traveled to visit her brother in Boston. While she waited to use the restroom in economy class, the unnamed flight attendant approached her and told her to use the bathroom at the front of the plane in first class, the complaint stated.After leading her there, the flight attendant allegedly entered the restroom before the teen and told her he needed to wash his hands before trash collection began. About a minute later, he exited the restroom and, according to the complaint, told the girl, “The toilet seat in there is broken. But don’t worry about it. We’re going to get it fixed when we get back to Charlotte.”The girl saw the toilet lid had red tape with the words “SEAT BROKEN” written on it, according to the complaint. She locked the door and used the restroom. But when she tried to flush the toilet she said she found a phone hidden beneath the tape with its camera flash turned on.The plaintiff, identified as only Jane Doe, “was shocked and scared,” the complaint stated. “It immediately occurred to her that someone had put the phone there to film her using the toilet.” She then took a photo with her own phone of the alleged setup.Once she left the restroom, the flight attendant went back in, locked the door and the girl returned to her seat where she informed her parents of what happened.The teen’s father insisted on seeing the male flight attendant’s phone. The lawsuit says the father witnessed the flight attendant “tapping furiously” on his device’s screen before eventually handing it over. The father did not see any suspicious or questionable videos or photos, the complaint stated.“The male flight attendant had ample time to delete or hide on his phone, any and all incriminating images or videos on his phone during that second half of the flight, when he had complete access to his phone,” the complaint continued.According to the family, an FBI agent informed the girl’s parents later that they did not arrest the man because they did not find images of the girl on his phone.",3655,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/12/01/american-airlines-bathroom-camera-lawsuit/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,destroy file court access reach begin matter knew attendant alleges complete back film plane trash arrest scar find boston photo told camera employee left robert wash word red flush client approach september doe hire half lead worry found safety statement time broken write travel furiously action cooperate happen western affix investigation fact insist midflight girl class fully beneath parent male protect front lawsuit put work tape accord visit allegedly hid allege complaint report plaintiff phone complain airline enter brother wait seat district fbi unnamed exacerbate incriminate security restroom member young question hide jane respond occur identify lock questionable agent exit law record immediately perpetrate charlotte bathroom confiscate witness bother tap north attorney carolina iphone high state cellphone ample father daughter secretly collection return hidden aboard check device american toilet enforcement delete flash image fail minute suspicious buric crew lid eventually family video shock turn represent employ incident flight screen month hand fix friday start inform economy,-0.97915,0.3283173734610123,9.538443804034578,0.2417032967032967,0,2023-12-01
Politico,A federal TikTok ban appears doomed by Montana ruling,2023-12-01 17:07:00,Rebecca Kern,"The federal judge who blocked Montana’s blanket ban on TikTok may have just created an opening for lawmakers in Washington trying to think bigger than one social media app.Judge Donald Molloy’s Thursday ruling technically only stalls Montana’s plans to block the popular video-sharing app for its residents starting in the new year. But several experts said the decision — which found the law to be a violation of the First Amendment — likely foreclosed on the idea of a broad, nationwide ban of TikTok or that copycat bills would move in other states.Banning the app, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, is a popular China-bashing message conservatives put in the spotlight during last month’s Republican presidential debate. And Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte said the law — which would fine app stores $10,000 if they continued offering the app to customers — was aimed at protecting residents from foreign influence by the Chinese Communist Party.Instead, what the ruling has sparked is some hope among Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill convinced that a more nuanced approach that doesn’t just target a single platform was always needed.“The court ruling demonstrates the legal and constitutional difficulties an outright ban faces,” said Ryan Wrasse, a spokesperson for Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who is pushing a bipartisan bill to give the administration more power to block technologies tied to foreign adversaries like China and Russia. “Without meaningful action, foreign-adversary-owned technologies like TikTok aren’t going away, and Congress needs to take these national security threats head on without delay.”For now, TikTok, which is used by more than 150 million Americans, is here to stay. The Biden administration’s national security review of TikTok remains tied up over a disagreement on whether to force a sale of the platform. And on Capitol Hill, efforts to enact an outright ban on TikTok over national security concerns stalled long before lawmakers started to approach the holiday season. But some experts weren’t surprised by these difficulties or by the ruling itself.“Whenever anyone uses the word ban, I know they’re not serious, because you can’t ban TikTok,” said James Lewis, the director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, adding it would be unconstitutional and constrain speech.Gianforte’s office, nor the office of Republican state Sen. Shelley Vance, who authored the TikTok ban legislation, responded to requests for comment.The RESTRICT Act, from Thune and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), has the backing of the Biden administration and would give the executive branch authorities they lacked when a similar effort to ban TikTok by the Trump administration was blocked by two federal judges in 2020.Rachel Cohen, a Warner spokesperson, said the RESTRICT Act is “carefully drafted to be constitutional.”But the RESTRICT Act has faced Republican blowback over claims it gives the Biden administration too much power. It would also have to go through the Senate Commerce Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who is writing her own foreign adversary tech bill this Congress.“Crafting legislation that can withstand court scrutiny is one of Sen. Cantwell’s primary goals,” Tricia Enright, a Cantwell spokesperson, told POLITICO. They are continuing to work on the bill text, but didn’t provide a timeline for introduction.Outright TikTok ban bills, like those from China hawks such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), seem even more suspect after Molloy’s ruling.While Rubio remained confident in his ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act, telling POLITICO, “The Chinese Communist Party doesn’t have a constitutional right to conduct influence operations in the United States,” his bill hasn’t moved since it was introduced in February.It was because federal efforts to ban TikTok stalled that states like Montana took action in passing a law in May banning the app for its 1.1 million residents — a move TikTok and its creators sued soon after.Montana’s office of the attorney general said they’re still reviewing their options, which could include an appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. “We look forward to presenting the complete legal argument to defend the law that protects Montanans from the Chinese Communist Party obtaining and using their data,” the office said.Montana’s “likelihood of success is slim to none,” said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow in technology policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. “This is not good for the federal government if it attempts to adopt an outright ban of TikTok.”",4678,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/01/tiktok-ban-montana-00129692,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/723edf7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F4b%2F02%2F8636066f46aeae7026f892758ce0%2Ftiktok-lawsuits-indiana-97535.jpg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain present meaningful thursday donald suspect nonresident single broad biden told judge administration holiday party word montana argument adopt republican authority timeline popular option gov ban surprised congress write politico action communist technically push bipartisan offering convince head continued social protect put lewis carefully trump enright forward act expert restrict creator data stay obtain copycat conservative commerce customer calvert spotlight give office scrutiny director spark add request plan adversary likelihood law blanket text attorney center foreign operation policy constrain provide attempt circuit bytedance tricia committee continue hawley presidential appeal thune blowback craft million ruling move cohen disagreement executive big legislation app institute slim difficulty court power government passing complete chinese legal resident conduct withstand store idea target study amendment hawk bill include away approach introduce fine international spokesperson senate platform fellow found outright concern violation nationwide gianforte tech josh rubio technology chair demonstrates goal force draft message china work mark warner marco montanan remains block capitol primary john clay foreclose effort security ccp tiktok opening year enact long strategic respond success general senior backing debate lack branch season review unconstitutional national cantwell federal threat hope lawmaker program greg maria state constitutional medium nuanced similar aim democrat influence washington vance russia american ryan molloy claim enterprise james shelley protects month confident hill united defend create start author tie stall decision wrasse,-0.0579,0.0641299700726806,10.852491228070171,0.3902856691919192,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,Smartmatic’s lawsuit against Fox News heats up with Murdoch depositions,2023-12-01 16:46:00,Jeremy Barr,"Rupert Murdoch formally handed over the reins of Fox News’ parent company in mid-November, but that did not end his legal obligations in the long-running fallout over how the network covered the 2020 presidential election.This week, the 92-year-old media mogul sat for a sworn deposition in the second major defamation lawsuit from an election-technology company that accused Fox of smearing it with false claims of vote rigging.It’s been seven months since Fox News settled a headline-making defamation suit from Dominion Voting Systems for a record $787.5 million. But in recent weeks the Smartmatic case has stirred to life, putting Murdoch’s company once again in legal peril. Murdoch’s son Lachlan, who now runs the family’s media business, will also be deposed in the case, as will Fox’s former top lawyer, Viet D. Dinh, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to comment.Fox believes that the case is winnable. The company says Smartmatic’s massive claim of $2.7 billion in financial losses is way off base, since it operates sparingly in the United States, with only one contract in one county for the 2020 election, while Dominion’s machines were used in several key states.But the network’s First Amendment defense — that Fox hosts were just doing their jobs and reporting the news — is very similar to what it used in the Dominion case, an argument that was rejected by that judge. Despite Fox’s efforts to distinguish the cases, a Dominion lawyer said at a hearing in September that “Smartmatic’s defamation action is based on many of the same statements.”“We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,” a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. “As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic’s damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on its face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.”That report, conducted by University of Chicago business law professor Daniel R. Fischel and issued in 2022, concluded that Smartmatic’s damages claims were “unfounded” and not in line with the company’s historical performance, which he said was weak in the years prior to the 2020 election. Smartmatic has argued that its enterprise value was “destroyed” by the allegedly defamatory statements, with the company now worth “a fraction of what it was as a result of Defendants’ disinformation campaign.” Neither Smartmatic nor Fox News agreed to an on-the-record interview for this story.The Dominion settlement spared Murdoch from having to testify in court, a prospect that had worried Fox. But several of his own statements in his deposition for that case hurt Fox’s chances — such as his acknowledgment that some network stars “endorsed” election conspiracy theories — and generated an avalanche of bad publicity in the process.The judge in the case is currently weighing a bid from Fox Corporation, the news channel’s parent company, to be excused from the lawsuit. Fox has argued that top corporate leaders like the Murdochs were not directly involved in coverage decisions. But Smartmatic’s lead attorney, J. Erik Connolly, argued at the September hearing that the Murdochs acted like mob bosses, directing the network’s coverage even if they did not personally participate. “Unquestionably, we would all say the mafia boss participated in the hit when the hit happened,” he argued in court. “The exact same thing happened here. Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch ordered a hit.”The two sides are currently duking it out to obtain relevant communications and conduct depositions with key players in the process known as fact discovery. In late October, the judge rejected Fox’s request to subpoena the liberal philanthropist George Soros and his son; the network had seemingly been looking to establish a connection between the Soros family and Smartmatic to help provide factual evidence for on-air claims, such as Trump lawyer Sidney Powell’s contention that “there are George Soros connections to this entire endeavor,” but the judge determined such a matter was “peripheral” to the case at large. (Smartmatic has denied Powell’s allegations.)In late September, Fox News attempted to pull back documents that it provided to Smartmatic, arguing that they were protected from disclosure by New York’s marital privilege law, which shields confidential communications between spouses. But Smartmatic refused Fox’s request to destroy the documents, arguing that the communications are relevant to the case, including one email thread about a January 2021 Mediaite.com article headlined “Fox News Personalities Amplified Big Lie of Stolen Election.”Once the discovery process concludes, both sides will have until summer to conduct depositions of expert witnesses, who will testify about issues such as election security and the journalistic process.It will still be about one year before both sides file their motions for summary judgment, lobbying the judge to decide the case in their favor. Dominion used that step to publicize the fruits of their discovery efforts, making headlines around the world.In its lawsuit, filed in February 2021, Smartmatic alleged that Fox guests and hosts falsely accused the voting technology company of participating in an international conspiracy to steal the election from Donald Trump and hand it to Joe Biden — all in an effort to shield Trump from blame for his electoral defeat and satisfy his legion of passionate, Fox-watching supporters.Specifically, Smartmatic pointed to 13 Fox broadcasts over the course of November and December 2020 “stating and implying that Smartmatic had stolen the 2020 U.S. election,” and cited over 100 total “false and misleading” statements made on Fox about the company. As with the Dominion case, Trump-affiliated lawyers Powell and Rudy Giuliani were singled out for their comments, as were Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo, who were also sued individually. In one appearance on Pirro’s show, Powell said that Smartmatic, which was founded in Florida, was “created for the express purpose of being able to alter votes and secure the reelection of Hugo Chávez,” a claim that Smartmatic has denied. Pirro did not challenge Powell’s claims and agreed that Smartmatic should be investigated — “hopefully [by] the Department of Justice,” she added. In a separate segment, Bartiromo cited a “source” who told her that Smartmatic technology “has a backdoor ... that allows the votes to be mirrored and monitored, allowing an intervening party a real-time understanding of how many votes will be needed to gain an electoral advantage.”In March 2022, the judge in the case, David B. Cohen, rejected Fox’s motion to dismiss the case. “Even assuming that Fox News did not intentionally allow this false narrative to be broadcasted, there is a substantial basis for plaintiffs’ claim that, at a minimum, Fox News turned a blind eye to a litany of outrageous claims about plaintiffs, unprecedented in the history of American elections, so inherently improbable that it evinced a reckless disregard for the truth,” he wrote.Fox is still facing several other lawsuits from shareholders who believe company management abdicated their fiduciary responsibility by permitting election-related conspiracy theories to air. The company is also facing a lawsuit from a former marine, Ray Epps, who says he was smeared in Fox’s coverage of the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.But Smartmatic appears to be looking mainly at the Dominion case, which provides not only a precedent for a settlement but a mountain of relevant communications and depositions that can help build its case.Jeffrey J. Pyle, an adjunct professor of law at Boston College Law School, said the Dominion case will be helpful to Smartmatic because it unearthed evidence that Fox executives did not believe the election fraud accusations, many of which tied together Dominion and Smartmatic.“The Dominion result certainly has to be encouraging to Smartmatic about the result it could obtain in this case,” Pyle said. “Dominion probably would have won at trial if it had gone forward, and based on what I know now Smartmatic is probably feeling good about its chances too.”Fox News has so far shown no inclination toward settling the case, though it’s still early in the process. The Dominion case was settled minutes before the trial was set to begin.Veteran First Amendment lawyer James C. Goodale said that Fox faced a mountain of bad evidence in the Dominion case — “the worst record I’ve ever seen,” he said — and said the network should settle if it faces a similar situation with Smartmatic.Were Fox to settle, they would probably do so before the summary judgment process, thereby avoiding waves of disclosures and media coverage.",8825,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2023/12/01/smartmatic-fox-news-lawsuit-rupert-murdoch/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,defendant lie corporate make rupert file disinformation inherently reporting prepared accuse lou donald knowledge matter challenge document fraud back pull chance single endeavor key build boston connection biden told probably dismiss february judge fischel party bos lachlan mislead mafia comment recent truth argument unearthed monitor personality currently cover refuse privilege soros assume improbable testify news understand giuliani statement march network order corporation blame action marital damage boss reckless college fact substantial responsibility justice unfounded steal base viet management protect put allegedly trump job mogul journalistic plaintiff forward ready act value air ray expert theory star process stir deny fallout florida disregard rudy obtain article total conspiracy former week rein marine adjunct generate blind daniel add request dobbs narrative player bartiromo law electoral precedent witness summary powell concludes defense run evidence attorney decide intend direct authorize connolly false school believe philanthropist performance major voting murdoch permit university provide inclination shield attempt summer depose participate minute prior smear interview presidential goodale settlement unprecedented formally chill lawyer peripheral intentionally separate allegation host accusation defamatory feel reject hand october historical million lobbying york imply november cohen big mirror executive defeat broadcast source establish destroy headline history encourage company litany court joe sworn judgment hugo event chávez exact trial unquestionably legal acknowledgment conduct david amendment include winnable personally relevant destroyed coverage september fraction segment international distinguish suit spokesperson lead contention financial line favor dinh vote found machine reality pirro peril sparingly hurt wave thread set investigate backdoor county bid happen technology satisfy defamation newsworthy show sidney amplify epps weigh appearance parent motion intervene spar lawsuit professor accord january extremely allege confidential fiduciary passionate report side course obligation chicago implausible capitol disclosure individually avalanche disconnect avoid effort issue prospect operates security early reelection evince settle late secure year falsely sat jeanine seemingly discovery top worried erik determine election channel publicize shareholder factual george smartmatic liberal record case large spouse surround billion basis hearing weak worth agree fox outrageous person maria minimum state legion abdicate situation system business alter medium email deposition similar december leader pyle entire endorse contract involve argue hit mountain mob american department claim despite enterprise publicity loss subpoena directly point guest james eye family communication duking fruit turn purpose express conclude excuse month result united defend create tie massive dominion decision helpful step life,-0.7225,0.2719546742209632,10.669487970388648,0.4624456327985739,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,"Amazon awards launches to SpaceX, its main internet satellite rival",2023-12-01 16:10:00,Christian Davenport,"Amazon announced Friday that it has signed a contract with SpaceX, its main rival in the internet satellite business, for three launches of its Kuiper satellites as it faces a deadline to get its spacecraft into orbit.The contract is a victory for SpaceX and further demonstration that its Falcon 9 rocket has become the workhorse for the United States space industry. It also comes months after an Amazon shareholder accused the company in a lawsuit of not awarding a launch contract to SpaceX because of a rivalry between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and SpaceX founder Elon Musk.Amazon previously had announced contracts with three other rocket companies, including Blue Origin, Bezos’s space venture. But none of those rockets has ever flown, and under its license from the Federal Communications Commission, Amazon needs to get half of the 3,236 satellites it plans for its service into orbit by July 2026. (Bezos also owns The Washington Post. Interim Post CEO Patty Stonesifer is a member of Amazon’s board.)SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet service is already operational and expanding its reach rapidly, with some 5,000 satellites in orbit. Amazon launched its first two prototype satellites only in October. The company has said those two are operating as expected, “validating key technologies that underpin the network.”Both services are designed to beam internet signals to ground stations in remote areas that don’t have reliable access to broadband.In a statement, Amazon said the launches on SpaceX would happen in 2025. It noted the proven track record of the Falcon 9, saying it “has completed more than 270 successful launches to date.”To compete with SpaceX, Amazon has said it intends to invest $10 billion in Kuiper and last year said it would launch its satellites on Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, the United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan and Arianespace’s Ariane 6. But all three have faced delays as Amazon faces a time crunch.Those launch contracts sparked a lawsuit, filed in August by an Amazon shareholder, that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty by failing to consider giving the launch business to SpaceX, one of the most affordable and reliable launch providers in the world.“By excluding SpaceX, Bezos and his management team minimized bid competition for the launch agreements and likely committed Amazon to spending hundreds of millions of dollars more than it would have otherwise had to,” the suit says.It also alleges that driving Amazon’s failure to award launch contract to SpaceX was the rivalry between Bezos and Musk. “Given their bitter track record, Bezos had every reason to exclude Musk’s SpaceX from the process entirely,” the lawsuit says. “And Bezos, it must be assumed, could not swallow his pride to seek his bitter rival’s help to launch Amazon’s satellites.”Last year, Dave Limp, then Amazon’s senior vice president for devices and services, said an in interview with The Washington Post that Amazon was “open to talking to SpaceX. You’d be crazy not to, given their track record.”He said then that the Falcon 9 “is probably at the low end of kind of the capacity that we need.” But he added that the company could use its Falcon Heavy or Starship, which have the ability to lift more mass to orbit.Limp will assume the chief executive’s role at Blue Origin on Monday.Amazon celebrated the successful flight of its two prototypes, but said it still had a long road ahead.",3435,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/01/amazon-spacex-starlink-kuiper-bezos-musk/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,ground board file company proven dave accuse deadline access rivalry president reach limp seek alleges agreement complete spacecraft alliance jeff executive key expect probably include flown station satellite blue team bitter ariane heavy amazon founder breach rapidly half prototype patty suit area commission spending assume ahead glenn announce crazy statement exclude rival interim time beam internet minimize august bid previously technology happen arianespace consider drive validate kuiper duty chief vulcan management celebrate lawsuit low lift bezos delay space orbit launch operating fiduciary track affordable dollar vice open capacity compete process stonesifer july member invest starlink year signal long starship reason reliable give senior underpin musk design spark hundred shareholder plan successful add falcon award sign workhorse federal record billion ceo commit competition service venture operational intend role state failure business origin demonstration spacex license mass contract device washington expand kind road victory post fail interview provider communication pride swallow ability flight month elon october note industry friday united remote entirely million talk rocket,0.9558,0.0,9.633784615384611,0.4839393939393939,0,2023-12-01
CNN,Proud dad Dwayne Johnson hopes his daughters inherit legacy of hard work,2023-12-01 16:02:00,Sandra Gonzalez,"The bottom of every bottle of Dwayne Johnson’s Teremana tequila is embossed with the letters “TIJASI” – the first two letters of his three daughters’ first names.Sweet? Certainly. But to Johnson – a wrestler turned multi-hyphenate box office behemoth – he hopes it’s also a reminder.“What I try to do with the girls is show them that No. 1, the world is yours. And as little girls – and little girls of color – it’s out there,” he told reporters Thursday. “You’re gonna have your struggles, and if Teremana is an example of hard work [and] creating something for people [to] like and enjoy, let it be your example.”Johnson explained this tribute to Tiana, 5, Jasmine, 7, and Simone, 22, over a glass of Teremana Blanco (poured over ice, with an orange slice, in case you’re curious) at Mana Holiday House, a limited-engagement brand-focused experience being held in Los Angeles this weekend, in New York City on December 12 and 13 and online.In a laid-back chat, Johnson spoke about his family, shared lessons he learned launching a business during a global pandemic and joked about his favorite holiday drinking games.Teremana was released at the start of coronavirus three years ago. Reflecting on the journey, Johnson said launching a new brand at a time when people sought comfort and familiarity was a challenge that required throwing away their initial rollout plans in favor of something more intimate.They set aside their marketing budget and opted to launch Teremana Tuesdays on Johnson’s Instagram account, where he’d pour himself a drink and engage with the public.This approach, Johnson said, allowed him to “really get to know people” and “them to know me.”“It did enable me to connect with people – community – in ways that I hadn’t before that. Then I realized, oh, let’s just start applying this now to everything else as we move forward.”Johnson said he’s a subscriber to the idea of “the best thing that never happened” – a hard-learned lesson born from instances of disappointment over the years. But, he said, “I believe in trusting my gut and I believe in having faith.”“Whatever’s going to happen is the thing that needed to happen at the time,” he said.Teremana’s early marketing pivot seems to have worked out well.The brand recently announced sales had surpassed one million cases annually, according to a press release.“I’ve said this before…the easiest thing we could be, the most powerful thing we could be is ourselves,” Johnson said. “And it took me years…I started saying it, but then I didn’t realize the power of it until I really started…living it.”This holiday season, Johnson said he plans to continue his family tradition of togetherness, with, of course, a visit from Santa once his young ones go to bed around 11 p.m. after doing “their best to stay up as long as they can.”The drinking games, meanwhile, start once they go to sleep. But his favorite one?“They wound up making my babies so…” he said, laughing, “It’s the best.”",2966,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/entertainment/dwayne-johnson-teremana/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170619101431-sandra-gonzalez.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,learn disappointment drinking enable make thursday opt power challenge powerful comfort tuesday idea told wrestler gut tequila weekend wound holiday community away pivot baby born account drink approach realize struggle ago throw familiarity favor apply santa sleep reporter tribute announce slice time trust set surpass happen show girl recently emboss orange spoke gon color work bottle brand johnson sought engage accord visit instance world launch pandemic annually marketing course initial journey laugh early stay favorite young year subscriber hard long simone press tradition coronavirus office require teremana joked bed plan season rollout release glass case share game york hope lesson connect business daughter december box enjoy blanco global believe city reflect budget tiana bottom tijasi togetherness instagram house chat continue explain experience family easy held turn behemoth ice angeles letter jasmine create curious start million move dwayne,0.991,0.1011463250168577,6.924935897435898,0.4532908449575117,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,The NSO serves up a two-course tour de force at the Kennedy Center,2023-12-01 15:57:00,Michael Andor Brodeur,"On Thursday night at the Kennedy Center, the National Symphony Orchestra demonstrated that you don’t need carols to channel holiday spirit. You just need bright guests and big portions.So accustomed have concertgoers become to the usual three-course, prix fixe programs that our stomachs may rumble at any disruption to the cadence. But the nearly full concert hall on Thursday sounded more than satisfied with the evening’s meat and potatoes: Led by Finnish conductor Dima Slobodeniouk and joined by pianist Yefim Bronfman, the NSO delivered piping hot accounts of Brahms’s formidable 1881 “Piano Concerto No. 2″ and Tchaikovsky’s 1878 “Symphony No. 4.” It was the kind of concert you roll home from.It was also the kind of concert that makes you wonder why we don’t get this one-two wallop approach more often. Certainly, a program of two works in the 40- to 50-minute range represents a more demanding test of already winnowing attention spans, not to mention one’s cough-stymying skills. But in the case of these two titanic works by Brahms and Tchaikovsky, this balanced presentation of nearly contemporaneous music can offer listeners a useful sense of cohesion — and no small degree of tension.After all, there’s some Bravo-level drama here. Pyotr had few sweet sentiments to share about Johannes.Over the years, in diary entries and letters, Tchaikovsky slagged the slightly elder Brahms (with whom, seven years removed, he shared a birthday) as “a scoundrel,” a “giftless bastard” and “a caricature of Beethoven.”“It angers me that this conceited mediocrity is regarded as a genius,” he scratched to himself in his diary. “I can’t stand him,” he stated flatly in an 1880 letter to Nadezhda von Meck (the benefactress of his fourth symphony, and the “best friend” noted in its dedication).For the sake of the holidays, it should be noted that an 1887 episode of yuletide partying in Leipzig did momentarily soften relations: “I went on the booze with Brahms — he’s awfully fond of drinking, you know; he’s a very nice person and not at all as proud as I had imagined.”All that said, and despite a coupling neither composer would ever have authorized, these two big works got along well, falling helplessly into productive and often breathless conversation.Slobodeniouk and Bronfman gave performances of workmanlike focus and oversize presence, navigating the concerto with an evident affection for its sentimental colors and shifting moods. This was extra so for the Finn, formerly the music director of the Orquesta Sinfónica de Galicia, and lately guesting up a storm with any top orchestra you can think of. A smart one will snatch him up.Bronfman was in dazzling form, unleashing what often felt like an impossible lightness through the first movement and sustaining an easy dialogue with the strings, the oboes, the horns, as though breezing through a party.The 65-year-old pianist is a pleasure to hear and to watch — even as he sits in patient silence awaiting his next entrance — bringing intense colors without a trace of showiness, concealing opulence with a bespoke fit.He lit up the second movement — a bonus scherzo in this atypical concerto — with spiky accents contrasted by soft, introspective asides. Cellist David Hardy earned a post-show handshake from Bronfman and extended applause from the audience with sinuous lines woven through the gorgeously gossamer andante third movement.And the finale was a fine example of teamwork between conductor and soloist, Bronfman and Slobodeniouk drawing its allegretto grazioso tight around them — with those elastic Hungarian rhythms and sprightly finish. Like any good party, it ended before you wanted it to.(After long applause, Bronfman returned to answer encore demands with a whirling run through Chopin’s “Étude Op. 10, No. 12 in C minor,” a.k.a. the “Revolutionary Étude.”)Slobodeniouk’s return post-intermission made me wonder how much Red Bull is kept backstage at the Kennedy Center. Perhaps it’s just the nature of the beast that is “Symphony No. 4” — as tender and tumultuous a stretch of music as Tchaikovsky ever composed — but the conductor arrived to the stage seemingly recharged to relate an amplified account of this symphonic tug-of-war between the pleasures of life and the promise of fate.From its bracing opening motto of horns, Slobodeniouk embraced the first movement’s grandeur and grace, while preserving its sense of proverbial personal space. He left vast stretches of negative space and let the orchestra grow into them — exciting builds of strings and beguiling themes from the flutes and woodwinds all achieved something like high definition.The songlike second movement, with its silken oboe, was gorgeously realized — though I might have liked a bit more bottom and oomph in its refrains. The whimsical, bristling pizzicato-fest of the third movement scherzo would tickle any ASMR enthusiast — the dynamic gales blowing through the orchestra lifted harmonic swells to unexpected heights.And its folk-infused “allegro con fuoco” finale built its modest theme — the Russian folk tune “In the field a little birch tree stood” — into towering statements of brass. Slobodeniouk was completely in charge of its racing tuttis and thrilling timbral collisions, its charging momentum and deluge of detail. It was a big finish to a colossal piece at the end of a long night — and a memorable helping of what we come to the concert hall for.",5432,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2023/12/01/review-nso-yefim-bronfman-dima-slobodeniouk/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make drinking spirit thursday prix extend elastic symphonic guesting contemporaneous birch handshake conceal drama movement cellist soft build helplessly hot slobodeniouk genius left concertgoers hardy memorable tickle holiday party horn bright sound scratch account productive dazzle accent satisfied workmanlike demonstrate fourth tree recharge presence statement stage concert galicia evident formerly bespoke roll deluge sentimental grow yuletide nature friend string field relation tumultuous lift excite pyotr flatly listener episode opulence navigate flute timbral caricature woodwind finnish relate snatch leipzig harmonic kennedy earn pianist unleash dynamic vast winnow give rhythm backstage teamwork slightly cohesion tchaikovsky director smart finn thrill potato accustom scoundrel intense stomach bonus share bastard dialogue asmr gorgeously extra run motto center fixe breathless collision piece finish tower authorize andante hall built dedication tight grandeur performance beast kind bottom beguiling diary achieve soloist whirl hear trace tender full bull compose focus easy showiness sprightly preserve note remove modest degree carol bring promise unexpected big colossal folk composer anger shift formidable scherzo presentation stand pip nadezhda lit race yefim brass applause breezing regard draw arrive storm home patient grace span david personal silence bristling charge piano red approach hungarian deliver encore realize fine lead russian line bracing momentarily contrast introspective sake disruption blowing audience elder mood range revolutionary birthday spiky entrance proverbial amplify impossible oomph stood atypical theme lightness skill color sentiment conceited finale small meat work attention woven soften concerto space oversize awfully songlike rumble fuoco sinfónica gale affection await opening year long seemingly top sits music bit channel étude stretch refrain titanic booze orchestra entry silken completely bronfman slag allegro negative test national mention conductor minor allegretto whimsical case join usual brahms gossamer proud program giftless person high night state dima fall return momentum answer watch symphony couple swell tuttis detail fond nice wonder balance despite form pleasure felt chopin orquesta sweet grazioso guest oboe embrace sinuous offer mediocrity represent cadence enthusiast letter meck wallop demand life sustain nso benefactress,0.99755,0.1104565537555228,10.13866931479642,0.480747863247863,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,"The DeSantis-Newsom debate had no rules, no metrics and no winner",2023-12-01 15:46:00,Lili Loofbourow,"My partner once told me about a fight he witnessed between a goat and a dog. They met on the dog’s terrain (the goat had broken loose), but neither animal could figure out why his attacks weren’t working. The goat’s loose skin made the dog’s lunges at its throat ineffective, flummoxing the dog, and the goat couldn’t work out why the dog — in lieu of head-butting back with its horns — kept nipping from beneath.I thought about that story more than once while watching the debate Fox News hosted last night in Alpharetta, Ga., between California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). It was a noisy, confusing spectacle, with lots of shouting and unclear rules. There was no metric for victory, no shared standard for how to score a point. Carefully worded statistics were wielded like cudgels, repackaged and denied. If other viewers were anything like me, they came away feeling they’d learned more about nihilism than governance. Clips circulated in the aftermath, as they always do, advertising moments in which DeSantis “schooled” Newsom or Newsom “annihilated” DeSantis, but the 90-minute encounter wasn’t reducible to those pleasing, definitive terms. It was inchoate, mismatched, bizarre.It’s hardly surprising that the two governors couldn’t come to a consensus, or that a Fox News event tilted right. Far more disorienting was the sense that we couldn’t even — as a country, or even as consumers of television — agree on what a debate is.The moderator, Fox News personality Sean Hannity, began the evening by announcing he’d be putting his conservatism aside to focus on “fact-based perspectives.” Then he framed each question to depict California in the worst possible light and Florida in the best. Repeatedly saying he had no wish to be a hall monitor, Hannity refused to enforce time limits, but tended to let DeSantis talk over Newsom while preventing the latter from responding.I’m interested in genre betrayals, so it was interesting, in an academic way, to watch a debate moderator acknowledge the need for impartiality before going “mask-off” almost immediately, ostentatiously choosing a side. Hannity lobbed softballs at DeSantis, asking him (for example) what the odds were that murderous terrorists had gotten into the United States because of President Biden’s border policies (“One hundred percent!” DeSantis happily replied). His most robust challenge to the Florida governor involved raising the latter’s draconian anti-choice measure to gently ask him to explain his thinking. Hannity’s questions to Newsom, by contrast, included asking him to explain why “pornography” was being taught in California schools and “is Joe Biden paying you tonight?”Hannity was trying to help DeSantis, whose presidential campaign isn’t exactly thriving, but the open favoritism actually hurt the governor by making him seem weak. Eager to showcase his abilities as a fighter, DeSantis needled Newsom with a story about his father-in-law (who moved to Florida) and countered most of his points by loudly calling him a liar. Ironically, DeSantis dealt Newsom the most damage not when he was brandishing a map of feces in San Francisco or agreeing with Hannity’s charts, but when he responded to Newsom’s jeremiad against regressive taxation by pointing out — matter-of-factly, with no sneering — that California’s sales tax and gas prices were both higher than Florida’s.As for Newsom, he clearly understood that when the ref starts throwing punches, there’s no point in trying to work him. He knew he’d be on the defensive, but spent the evening adjusting his strategy. He started off sidestepping Hannity’s questions entirely to get his own talking points out — including an early slam noting that neither he nor DeSantis would be their party’s nominees for president. (This was Newsom’s advantage and one of the evening’s most disorienting mismatches: When one opponent is running for president and one isn’t, the stakes are wildly different.) Still, the approach felt evasive. By the end, he found more effective tactics, the most piercing of which (to my surprise) turned out to be deeply felt (rather than vitriolic) declarations of sadness and disgust about the way DeSantis treated migrants and other vulnerable populations. “I don’t like the way you demean people. I don’t like the way you demean the LGBT community, I don’t like the way you demean and humiliate people you disagree with, Ron. I really find this fundamentally offensive.”The two governors were engaged in radically different projects. While DeSantis hoped to dominate a blue-state governor to distinguish himself in a crowded field of candidates, Newsom hoped to embarrass the Florida governor, but clearly also saw himself as a Biden ambassador to Fox News audiences who would only have heard horror stories about the current administration. The disparity between these agendas only enhanced the sense that this “debate” was no such thing. It was Kabuki. The absence of an audience only enhanced a weird sense of intimacy behind the posturing. Everyone on that stage understood perfectly well that the frame they’d agreed to was a fiction.At that point — when everyone understands that the rules of engagement don’t matter — all you’re looking for is some breakthrough moment capable of puncturing it all.TV debates have famously done that in the past! Because the 1960 debate between Senator John F. Kennedy and then-Vice President Richard M. Nixon catapulted the comparatively obscure senator from Massachusetts (whose youth had, up until that point, been regarded as a political liability) into national prominence, there’s an idea that debates are relevant still. That they’re potential game-changers. The story then was that people listening on the radio thought Nixon had won, but viewers saw Kennedy as the victor. The medium redefined the standards for victory.You could feel those three men last night groping for something similar — a moment that could break through the cheap shots and rote antagonism to produce some new, clarifying consensus on who “won.”It never came. When the governors weren’t sporting peculiar frozen smiles (usually in response to being insulted) or calling each other liars, they interrupted each other fluidly and often unintelligibly, with each continuing to speak over the other in hopes that their opponent would stop. The lofty goal of comparing Republican and Democratic philosophies of governance receded into the much more primitive project of judging each man’s affect and rhythm as a shouter. I found myself admiring one man’s ability to keep what sounded like a vaguely grammatical sentence going (though I couldn’t quite gauge its contents) while another one spoke. I dinged another when I heard him stumble, mid-spiel, on a particular word.

Washington Post,Checking into a hotel? Prepare for hefty fees and deposits.,2023-12-01 15:43:00,Andrea Sachs,"Earlier this month, Lynette Eastman, general manager of the Surfjack Hotel and Swim Club in Honolulu, delivered some shocking news to a guest. It concerned her bill.The vacationer had called the Waikiki property requesting the total amount of an upcoming stay. She specifically asked about a resort fee, the sneaky charge that hotels often slip in at the last minute of the booking process and bury among the other taxes and fees. Eastman told her the Surfjack did not have a resort fee, though that was not always the case: The hotel had suspended the $26.18 fee in spring 2020 but never restored it, even after nearby properties reinstated theirs.“That was great because I got to experience her surprise,” Eastman said of the guest’s happy reaction. “Do I think a lot of hotels are going to start waiving fees? Possibly, if the business is in a location that doesn’t pick up, like in Hawaii. But my guess is that the fees will continue to be charged.”According to the American Hotel and Lodging Association, roughly 6 percent of U.S. properties exact a mandatory fee that hotels claim covers a grab bag of perks, such as WiFi, bike rental, fitness center or a food and beverage “credit.” Yet, the fee seems inescapable in many vacation destinations and is just one more financial burden placed on guests at check in.Hotels pile on so many charges, you might feel like you need an accountant to decipher your bill. In addition to the room rate, there may be a bundle of city, state and local taxes, plus a resort fee, which goes by many names and is also taxed. During check-in, the front desk employee will place a hold on your credit card for incidentals. The amount can range from a couple Jacksons to hundreds of dollars per night. Guests with credit cards won’t feel the pinch, but people who use debit cards cannot access that amount during their stay and may need to be careful with their expenditures.As long as you don’t trash your room or drain the minibar without paying, you will get the money back. This is not the case with resort fees. Even if you don’t use the WiFi, bike, fitness center or credit, you’re still stuck with the fee.“We can perceive both of these as friction points and annoyances for the hotel guest,” said Mehmet Erdem, a professor of hospitality at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, “though technically they’re separate accounting-wise and procedural.”Like a shifty character in a true-crime novel, the fee often hides in the shadows and goes by several aliases, such as resort, amenity, facility or destination. Some hotels also tack on a “room safe fee,” though the charge for having a safety box in your room is significantly less (a couple dollars a day) than the amenity fee (according to an analysis commissioned by AHLA, an average $26 per night).Chekitan Dev, a professor at Cornell University’s Nolan School of Hotel Administration, dates the current incarnation to 1997. Nearly two decades later, Lauren Wolfe founded Kill Resort Fees after a Key West hotel refused to hand over her room key until she forked over an extra $20.“Over a decade ago, we started to see resort fees in places like Hawaii, and then they started to creep into places like Las Vegas.” Wolfe said. “Then it spread like wildfire.”This summer, Wolfe turned up the heat as chief legal officer for Travelers United, a consumer advocacy group. In August, the nonprofit organization sued Hyatt and Sonesta Hotels, alleging false advertising and deceptive fees. The following month, it filed a class-action lawsuit against Hilton.“These hotels are not paying attention to any sort of law in their state, whether it be basic advertising laws that protect consumers from unfair, deceptive practices or alcohol laws that forbid people from essentially being forced to buy alcohol,” said Wolfe, referring to properties that include a cocktail in their resort fee.Since 2019, state attorneys general in a handful of states and D.C. have been suing some of the world’s biggest hotel chains for allegedly violating consumer protection laws. Some of the cases are still ongoing, such as Nebraska and Hilton and D.C. and Marriott. Others have been settled, such as the lawsuit that pitted attorneys general in Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas against Choice Hotels. As part of the September deal, the chain agreed to disclose all mandatory fees on the first page of its booking website and include them in the total price.This year, state and federal legislators also started tackling junk fees. In July, two U.S. senators introduced the bipartisan Hotel Fees Transparency Act. In October, California passed a pair of similar bills, including a law that will ban the hotel industry’s deceptive practice of drip pricing, in which companies list a partial price and does not reveal additional charges until later in the purchasing process. It goes into effect next July.Last year, the Biden administration called out these fees and rallied government agencies, Congress and the private sector to curtail the unfair practice. In October, the president revisited the issue, introducing a proposed Federal Trade Commission law that will require businesses, including hotels, to be upfront with their prices. The agency is accepting public comments through Jan. 8. Since Nov. 9, more than 20,200 people have submitted complaints.“I think if the pressure from the government and the regulations and the state attorney general offices and the lawsuits creates enough of a headache, then the industry will do something collectively about it,” Erdem said.The American Hotel and Lodging Association as well as individual hotels, such as Hilton, have expressed their support for legislation that requires transparency in pricing. However, the conversation about resort fees seems be ignoring some glaring issues.For one, the hotels are forcing guests to pay for services or perks that they might not want or need. (When was the last time you made a long-distance phone call on a hotel room phone?) On their websites, most properties bury the list of amenities associated with the fee, so consumers have to pick through the small print. Even when they find it, the descriptions can be indecipherable. Finally, a mystery surrounds the number itself.In a sampling of hotels in Washington, the amenity fee with tax ran the gamut, from zero (Citizen M, the Jefferson, Conrad Washington) to $23.19 (Washington Hilton), $28.99 (Marriott Marquis) and about $35 (the George, Yotel). The incidentals and security deposit was equally vast, ranging from $50 at the Days Inn to $200 at Hotel Washington.Travelers might discover higher charges in swankier destinations or at luxurious properties with fancy decor. At the Aria, on the Las Vegas Strip, the resort fee is $51 and the incidental hold runs from $150 for a standard room to $500 for a villa. Grand Beach Hotel Surfside in Florida hits guests with a $64.38 resort fee; the credit card hold is kinder, at $100 a night.The hotels contacted for comment declined to explain the calculations. One can only guess the financial outlay for, say, printing assistance at the front desk, a downloadable self-guided walking tour or a pool chair.“It’s a blackbox, let’s-see-what-sticks approach,” said Dev, adding that hotels typically consider supply, demand and competition when formulating the fee.During a trip to New York City, the professor could not fathom why the Even Hotel in Midtown East charged $25 (plus tax) for what he called “overpriced and useless amenities.” He and his wife passed on the Citi Bike passes (“I’d have to have a death wish”), local and long-distance calls (“This is a joke”), access to Peloton classes (""We were not visiting New York City to take a stationary bike lesson), package handling (“Huh?”) and laundry (“With the average stay being one to two nights, my garment might not make it back.”).They did, however, take advantage of the free welcome drink: two bottles of water valued at $2.It’s not hopeless. You can dodge resort fees.First, use your purchasing power. A NerdWallet analysis singled out the hotels with the highest average fees relative to room rate. Wyndham ranked first, with fees costing $30 and $50 per night, followed by Hyatt, IHG, Hilton and Marriott. Best Western, which is not really known as a playground of perks, came in last, with the lowest fee.You can also shop around for fee-free hotels. Kill Resort Fee’s lists hotels with fees in 15 destinations, so avoid those. (Look under “Offenders.”) In our D.C. sample, more than half did not charge a resort fee. On Surfjack’s website, the hotel promotes its lack of fees. A pop-up box exclaims, “Wipe out fees!”“We are definitely seeing a trend of hotels distinguishing themselves by not offering them at all,” said Sally French, lead writer with NerdWallet.If you are a loyalty hotel member, you can avoid the fees by booking with points, depending on the program’s policy. Also, the higher up you go on the status pole, the fewer extraneous fees you will have to pay. Some travel credit cards will also reimburse resort fees.In your kindest voice, you can also ask the front desk to remove the fee, especially if an amenity or service is not available during your stay.“If you’re checking in at 11 p.m. and checking out at 7 the next morning and you’re just using the hotel as a place to sleep, maybe that hypothetical trolley ride doesn’t even run during that period,” said French, referring to a perk at the Marriott Marquis. “It doesn’t hurt to tell the desk there was no way you could have taken that trolley ride and ask them to waive the resort fee.”Wolfe does not recommend pushing the issue. After two times, she says to quit. The next step is to send your complaint to the attorney general who serves your home state or the hotel’s. You can only pick one, so choose the location with the strongest consumer protection laws.",9883,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/12/01/resort-fees-hotels-deposits/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make happy file friction print beach luxurious finally pair tack beverage desk wish wyndham back creates trash jackson upfront single key biden told morning employee transparency lodge comment pressure safe stuck accept ban promotes news congress consider card technically pile bipartisan chief reveal front protect kindest swankier hilton perceive dollar group act value strong legislator headache rally garment process calculation hide bag advertising waikiki lot association pick vast handful price joke send trade character bike law place page tax competition nolan attorney destination marquis false school policy submit city texas unfair support earlier continue nebraska minute experience reimburse spread oregon heat hand october pinch gamut loyalty deal vacationer york bundle big fancy handle average practice president power pit private guess regulation fathom home local great west nearby conversation contact downloadable sample curtail charge manager money careful drink possibly deliver vacation half distinguish financial commission found sector eastman free hurt vega food number range august amount decade drip western purchasing advantage pricing yotel force addition pass glare lynette small accord water minibar indecipherable formulate allege trend pole property ran east avoid alias security walk taxed roughly location year long general disclose wipe dev organization follow senator require effect hundred standard shop tour jefferson surround lesson writer bury agree rate recommend night part similar blackbox cost creep perk couple percent dodge ride explain point reaction protection serf shock honolulu turn sonesta express ignore month basic deposit mehmet demand french annoyance step suspend choice kill agency ongoing concerned laundry package definitely administration villa partial rental significantly incidental decline cover refuse safety swim nerdwallet travel relative refer forbid wifi hypothetical push class offering overprice incarnation especially extraneous debit shifty low bottle fitness visit allegedly death complaint phone hopeless essentially playground stay july florida chain member total assistance strip office add request cocktail room hold public peloton welcome surprise extra pay service run printing hawaii center description ranked wife resort current ihg wolfe junk erdem university choose summer ahla propose club facility typically reinstate analysis officer separate shadow buy feel remove industry quit sally additional exclaims legislation violate company mystery revisit access government consumer midtown hospitality exact associate find legal lauren day kinder bill include citizen mandatory introduce september approach period book lead ago fee fork sleep upcoming outlay time conrad surfside voice status specifically aria collectively grab california stationary traveler professor lawsuit credit attention deceptive marriott world decor website tackle waive supply issue surfjack call trolley settle hyatt useless nevada lack date available decipher cornell george spring federal case discover accountant depend program individual zero high state burden business nonprofit box grand slip sneaky alcohol check washington hit sort american claim list pool inescapable amenity equally guest advocacy restore united start trip colorado drain pennsylvania,0.95535,0.1821309319032682,7.973954430379749,0.401949102677258,0,2023-12-01
NPR,"At Israeli rave site attacked by Hamas, DJs play music to honor the dead and missing",2023-12-01 14:46:00,Eleanor Beardsley,"RE'IM, Israel — In a small clearing in a eucalyptus forest, a lone DJ on a stage blasts out pulsing electronic music that punctuates the otherwise quiet landscape. There are no concertgoers. His crowd is a sea of poster-board faces atop poles. These are the faces of the 364 young people killed by Hamas-led militants last month in an attack on a rave party in Israel's Negev Desert. There are also pictures of dozens of people Hamas seized as hostages that same day. The memorial event took place Tuesday at the exact spot of the Nova festival massacre, to commemorate those whose lives were cut short and upended on Oct. 7, when Hamas killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. ""It's just our small way to tell the world what happened here,"" says Ilana Frenkel, one of the event's organizers. ""The size of the horror is more than anyone can imagine. This is the beginning of explaining how horrible it was."" Asher Swissa, AKA DJ Skazi, performed at the commemoration event. Maya Levin for NPR hide caption Asher Swissa, AKA DJ Skazi, performed at the commemoration event. Armed Israeli soldiers mill about. The scores of charred cars that were set afire during the attack have all been hauled away, and the burnt road is being repaved. But there are still a few mangled beach chairs and broken coolers lying in the surrounding fields and eucalyptus forest. The memorial event, held a couple of miles from the Gaza Strip, was hastily put together as the Israeli army only gave clearance a few days earlier. Five well-known Israeli DJs played music throughout the day, while pictures of the Oct. 7 attack victims were projected on screens. Asher Swissa, whose DJ name is Skazi, opened the event. ""This was not only a massacre of people,"" he says. ""It was a massacre of music, of freedom, of something much more bigger than us."" Swissa, a trance producer with a global following, was out of the country on Oct. 7. But he says it was extremely important to be here now for the memorial.

""I'd say I played many festivals in my life — including internationally. I've been all over the world. But I never felt what I feel here in this moment. I feel sadness,"" he says. ""Deep sadness."" Swissa says Israel is known the world over for its rave events and what's called psytrance, or psychedelic trance, music. The Nova rave party is held every year in different venues around Israel. Swissa hadn't been sure how he would open the tribute, but says he knew as soon as he got here. ""Im Nin'alu"" is one of his most famous mixes that he recorded with artist Mor Avrahami. Based on a Hebrew poem written by a 17th century Yemeni rabbi, Swissa says the song was fitting for a place where so many people were killed. The memorial rave lasted throughout the day, giving anyone who wished the opportunity to come. ""This is holy ground for us, and we came back to close the circle,"" says Bar Markos, 31, who managed to escape the Re'im attack with his twin brother.

The brothers escaped in their car on other dirt roads, and planned to leave the memorial the same way, to get some closure. He says this is the first time he's listened to music since the attack.

Twenty-three-year-old Yarden Guez is here because she lost many friends at the rave concert. She says the Oct. 7 attack has changed the way she thinks about living together with the Palestinians.

Washington Post,Ella Emhoff on her unlikely modeling career and making knitting ‘cool’,2023-12-01 14:22:00,Maura Judkis,"Model and designer Ella Emhoff gives style advice to her famous family, which includes Vice President Harris, who is her stepmother, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, her dad — and she can be “really brutal,” she said.“I’ve calmed down a little bit,” she said, and added in a self-deprecating tone: “Like, okay Ella, we get it, you’re a model.”That’s a job title that Emhoff, 24, has had a hard time wrapping her brain around, she revealed in a live interview Thursday with Washington Post fashion writer Rachel Tashjian in The Post’s second Style Sessions — conversations with tastemakers and Post reporters at D.C.’s Rubell Museum. During her stepmother’s inauguration, Emhoff was noticed for the cool clothes she wore to the swearing-in ceremony and was signed to a modeling agency soon after.“All of my life, I had really low self-esteem and self-confidence, so this kind of felt like a way for me to take that back,” she said. “I have body hair, I have tattoos. Like, that’s not crazy in the scheme of things today, but it’s not what you’d consider, like, the most generic-type model.”When she’s on the runway, “I just kind of black out and go into, like, a Zen state,” she said. “Basically, I’m trying not to look at Anna Wintour.”Emhoff also talked about choosing to work with sustainable and inclusive fashion brands, and how she incorporates sustainability into her own work. A graduate of the Parsons School of Design, she makes knitwear and recently launched a knitting club called Soft Hands.Knitwear is having a moment now, but for years, “I felt like the weird grandma who was trying to prove that this was cool,” she said. Knitting doesn’t get enough credit as an art form, she added: “It’s a very woman-coded, old, funky craft that maybe isn’t seen or valued as much in higher fine-art spaces,” a perception she hopes to change.Wearing a striped blue sweater she knit herself, wide-legged gray pants that she noted were cuffed with safety pins, and simple black brogues, Emhoff said that her personal style was not always in lockstep with her creative output. While the clothes she makes are quirky and colorful, she says lately she’s gravitated toward muted clothing inspired by school uniforms and suiting. “I’m meticulous about silhouette,” she said.And if you’ve been waiting for her to start her own brand of knitwear, she said you’ll have to wait a little longer: “I don’t know if I’m ready for that.” The limited number of hats she sells on her website are currently sold out.Emhoff’s father, the second gentleman, sat proudly in the first row, wearing a charcoal suit, and rushed in for a hug at the conclusion of the 45-minute long chat. Secret Service officers encircled the room.

ABC,South Korea launches its first spy satellite after rival North Korea does the same,2023-12-01 14:02:00,The Associated Press,"VANDENBERG SPACE FORCE BASE, Calif. -- South Korea launched its first military spy satellite into space Friday, a little over a week after North Korea claimed to put its own spy satellite into orbit for the first time as tensions rise between the rivals.Launched from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base using SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, it was the first of five spy satellites South Korea plans to send into space by 2025 under a contract with SpaceX. The event had been scheduled for earlier in the week but was pushed back because of weather conditions.South Korea had no military reconnaissance satellites of its own in space and has partially resorted to the United States’ spy satellites to monitor moves by North Korea.South Korea’s Defense Ministry described the launch as successful, saying the satellite had a communication with an overseas ground station.A ministry statement said the launch allowed the South Korean military to acquire an independent space-based surveillance system. It said the satellite would also help bolster the military’s preemptive missile strike capability, a key part of its so-called three-axis system that includes missile defense and massive retaliatory capabilities.After two launch failures earlier this year, North Korea said it successfully placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit last week. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t yet released any of those satellite photos.U.S. and South Korean officials confirmed the North Korean satellite entered orbit, but many outside experts question whether it can send militarily useful high-resolution imagery.The North Korean satellite launch sparked immediate, strong condemnations from the U.S., South Korea and others. Multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions ban any satellite launches by North Korea, viewing them as covers for testing its long-range missile technology.North Korea responded angrily, saying it has sovereign rights to launch spy satellites to cope with what it calls increasing U.S. hostilities. It said it would also launch additional ones.On Saturday, North Korea’s Defense Ministry threatened to take unspecified steps to eliminate or undermine the capabilities of U.S. spy satellites in protest of what it called the “rubbish” comments by an unspecified U.S. Space Command official that hinted at an attack on the North Korean satellite. The North Korean ministry said it would consider such an action a declaration of war.The North's statement followed remarks by Sheryll Klinkel, a public affairs officer for the U.S. Space Forces that were carried in Radio Free Asia, a U.S. government-funded news service, earlier in the week.Asked whether the United States has the ability to block the operation of North Korea’s spy satellite, the RFA report quoted Klinkel as saying that “Joint Force space operations could deny an adversary’s space and counterspace capabilities and services using a variety of reversible and irreversible means, reducing the effectiveness and lethality of adversary forces across all domains.""North Korea’s satellite launch has inflamed animosities between the two Koreas, with the rivals taking steps to breach a previous military agreement meant to ease front-line military tensions.Spy satellites are among the high-tech weapons systems that Kim Jong Un has publicly vowed to introduce. Since 2022, North Korea has conducted about 100 ballistic missile tests — part of efforts to modernize its arsenal of weapons targeting South Korea and the United States. South Korea and the United States have expanded their military exercises.South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers last week that Russia’s technological assistance likely enabled North Korea to place its spy satellite into orbit. South Korea, the U.S. and Japan have accused North Korea of seeking high-tech Russian technologies needed to enhance its military programs in return for supplying conventional arms to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. Both Russia and North Korea have denied the allegation.___",4172,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/south-korea-launches-spy-satellite-after-rival-north-105314089,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/3ec58975-b952-4ccb-b33c-fc83260a2a94/wirestory_87a083e3e9faecba0f1300ca2e6003c4_16x9.jpg?w=992,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,ground successfully site enable saturday increase condemnation accuse affair transmit seek event agreement back domain strike spy command counterspace radio missile retaliatory conduct key agency target told weather official include jong confirm claimed ballistic satellite comment introduce attack ukraine joint sheryll ministry breach monitor angrily vowed cover independent arsenal russian pentagon ban free news vandenberg statement nation time rival previous sovereign imagery action cope overseas consider technology push effectiveness white resolution force acquire inflame base california remark conventional put tension variety space orbit launch report council enter korean immediate threaten undermine strong block rise expert declaration weapon klinkel lethality militarily hostility effort deny supply south security call schedule question year week military assistance respond japan hint protest surveillance follow reversible animosity enhance step send spark capability plan successful falcon adversary public test release rubbish quote place lawmaker ease service defense north unspecified korea program resort state arm bolster failure eliminate system rfa part multiple operation return spacex contract described technological expand russia support earlier house publicly irreversible communication officer ability view modernize asia reconnaissance friday partially united meant massive move reduce rocket additional carry preemptive,-0.60605,0.071907957813998,13.38569384835479,0.4260610766045549,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,Is sparkling water bad for your teeth?,2023-12-01 13:21:00,Lindsey Bever,"Is it true that sparkling water can be bad for your teeth because it can erode tooth enamel?Beverages that have a low pH — meaning they are more acidic — have the potential to wear away tooth enamel over time, particularly when consumed often and in large quantities. Regular water has a pH of 7, which is neutral. Coffee measures about 5, lemon juice about 2 and stomach acid about 1.For beverages we consume often, the pH level, ideally, should be above 4, which is considered a “critical threshold,” said John Ruby, adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Anything below a pH of 4 increases risk of dental erosion, he said.In a 2016 study, Ruby and his colleagues tested the pH levels of nearly 400 beverages, and the findings were concerning. The study showed that most beverages tested — sports drinks, sodas, juices, fruit punches and many flavored waters — had a pH below 4. Many tested lower than 3.Drinking a low-pH beverage every now and then is unlikely to cause a dental issue. But experts say the risk increases if you consume multiple servings of these beverages every day.How did sparkling water hold up in the tests? Only two plain sparkling drinks were tested, and both tested higher than the threshold of 4, meaning they were not as much of an erosion risk. S.Pellegrino sparkling natural mineral water had a pH of 4.96. Perrier carbonated water tested at 5.25.But adding flavor to water, particularly citrus flavors containing citric acid, can lower the pH. In the 2016 study, Dasani plain water had a pH level of 5.03, but Dasani Lemon water had a pH of 3.03.Notably, separate research shows that at-home soda carbonators can create plain sparkling water that has a lower pH level than the store-bought kind. One study found that the pH level of water from a SodaStream carbonator ranged from 3.58 to 3.74. SodaStream did not respond to requests for comment.Sparkling water, which can be carbonated naturally or artificially, contains dissolved carbon dioxide gas that, through a chemical reaction, turns into carbonic acid, which gives it fizz and makes it more acidic than regular water.In terms of both dental and overall health, plain sparkling water is a far better alternative than sports drinks, sodas or fruit punch. But how much you drink may affect your dental health.Sipping from a bottle of sparkling water repeatedly throughout the day lowers the pH in the mouth and also may increase the risk of erosion, said Brittany Seymour, a spokeswoman for the American Dental Association and an associate professor at Harvard School of Dental Medicine.Seymour said she would advise patients that routinely substituting sparkling water for plain water — or drinking more than two or three bottles per day — may be overdoing it.Those who are at risk of dental erosion “are not the occasional consumers” of sparkling water, said Margherita Fontana, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry.Check with your dentist to determine whether your beverage habits are affecting tooth enamel.",3070,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/12/01/sparkling-water-dental-enamel/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,citric make drinking seymour increase plain dasani affect beverage consumer carbonator associate patient occasional day study spokeswoman gas pediatric harvard carbonators sport term perrier research away drink level measure carbonic chemical carbonate margherita found concern natural repeatedly tooth wear time dentistry range lemon serving consider mouth habit show birmingham soda substitute advise health neutral critical professor sodastream low bottle water alabama threshold risk ruby ideally expert michigan coffee john mineral erosion issue acidic alternative acid finding association respond adjunct give routinely teeth ph determine citrus quantity add request dissolve hold test stomach large contains fizz regular contain lower high meaning artificially multiple school dentist juice naturally carbon sparkle potential enamel consume university flavor kind dioxide american overdo reaction particularly fruit turn colleague separate fontana dental create punch brittany erode,0.8862000000000001,0.0,10.211154529307285,0.4546438210911895,0,2023-12-01

CNN,Serene Chinese boarding school named World Building of the Year,2023-12-01 12:31:00,Oscar Holland,"A Chinese boarding school designed to let students unwind and “waste time mindfully” has been named 2023’s World Building of the Year.Featuring a rooftop park, treehouses and elevated walkways in a “floating forest,” the Huizhen High School in Ningbo, Zhejiang province in eastern China, won the coveted title at the World Architecture Festival (WAF) in Singapore on Friday.Designed by Approach Design Studio and the Zhejiang University of Technology Engineering Design Group, the serene campus’ communal areas are intended to blur the distinction between inside and out. The building features an open-air lecture hall and tree-lined pathways, in addition to study facilities for the 30-class school’s students.Approach Design Studio said that while teaching prioritizes efficiency, a school’s campus itself should inspire free thinking. In its project description, the firm said its design was intended to let students “release stress, adjust their body and mind and discover beauty” outside the classroom.The coveted World Building of the Year title is considered one of the architecture profession’s top accolades and is decided at the annual festival by a 140-strong expert panel. This year’s winning design was commended by judges for breaking with the conventions of school design.Citing the jury while presenting the award on stage, WAF’s program director Paul Finch described the project as “(as) unexpected as it is delightful.”“The architects managed to create a school which is very different than the usual model, where students are boxed in and put under teaching — as well as architectural — pressure,” Finch told attendees. “By contrast, this design encourages walking, fresh air and the possibility of relief from academic intensity.”The design was chosen from almost 250 shortlisted projects, including Newark Liberty International Airport’s recently opened Terminal A, Australia’s Holocaust Museum in Melbourne and new national stadiums in both Cambodia and Senegal.Buildings were judged across 18 categories, spanning commercial, cultural and residential architecture. Those winners then competed for the overall prize.Huizhen High School triumphed in the school category. Other category winners included India’s 7.1 million-square-foot Surat Diamond Bourse, which this year surpassed the Pentagon to become the world’s largest office building, the Lanserhof Sylt, a hotel and health resort in Germany where buildings combine to form the largest thatched roof in Europe, and a residential home in the suburbs of Winnipeg, Canada.Held in Singapore, which is home to three recent winners of World Building of the Year, WAF also handed out prizes for landscape architecture — this year awarded to the Benjakitti Forest Park in Bangkok, Thailand, an “urban ecological sanctuary” being developed on the grounds of a former tobacco plant — as well as proposals for ambitious future architecture projects and interior design.Last year’s top prize was claimed by Australia’s Quay Quarter Tower, dubbed the world’s first “upcycled” high-rise after its design retained two-thirds of an old skyscraper on the site.",3122,https://www.cnn.com/style/huizhen-high-school-world-building-of-the-year/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210617141412-oscar-holland-2021.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,ground jury site present quarter inspire tobacco mind quay building architecture distinction australia triumphed bourse home convention chinese pathway combine study told architect span judge include europe model ecological claimed winnipeg commend recent approach thatch pressure mindfully accolade international teach rooftop area contrast plant pentagon free ningbo bangkok residential time winner stage thailand cultural lecture liberty dubbed surpass technology consider panel studio festival recently addition zhejiang prioritizes diamond walkway annual boxed china sanctuary float holocaust health covet park museum manage put newark unwind treehouses ambitious fresh inside world group shortlist encourages open air roof urban expert body surat germany compete different walk efficiency elevate blur year former commercial top communal suburb relief province office singapore director possibility design landscape judged award lanserhof national release forest category sylt prize terminal title serene discover cambodia large interior usual program decide description intend high resort break student tower skyscraper waste hall melbourne huizhen school feature stadium retain adjust benjakitti engineering university beauty described proposal academic waf attendee future form airport boarding upcycled india facility firm campus architectural chosen project paul finch hand eastern profession stress create developed win unexpected,0.9961,0.0960922485586162,12.229018181818184,0.3546212121212121,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,Americans are boringly predictable in smartphones. Here’s why.,2023-12-01 12:30:00,Shira Ovide,"This article is a preview of The Tech Friend newsletter. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Tuesday and Friday.We Americans are stuck in a smartphone rut.Samsung and Apple are the top smartphone sellers in the world, but in other countries there's often at least one other popular brand. Not in the United States.About three-quarters of the smartphones Americans buy are iPhones or Samsung devices. No other company tops 8 percent. It’s been like that for years.I'm not knocking your decision if you own an iPhone or a Samsung phone. There are few obvious reasons to pick something else.But the capitalist in me wonders what goodness we’re missing because two smartphone companies and three mobile service providers are happy (and rich) from America’s smartphone rut.Breaking the status quo can be glorious. Coke and Pepsi were really the only fizzy drinks that mattered for a long time. Then sparkling water companies like LaCroix and SodaStream changed people's habits and remade the supermarket drinks aisle.That’s what can happen when upstarts have a realistic chance to win you over.Some of you will buy a new smartphone this month. If nothing else, I want us to be aware of how uniquely limited our choices are.America’s three giant mobile phone providers (Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T) are the gatekeepers of your smartphone choices. They are good with the dominance of Samsung and Apple and have deals with those companies to push those phones to you.You benefit in some ways from these arrangements, but they do make it tough for newcomers to break through.For a glimpse at a few other countries: In Spain and Italy, China’s Xiaomi is the most popular and second-place smartphone seller, respectively, while Samsung and Apple are also big, according to research firm IDC.There are five or so popular smartphone brands in China and India. Smartphone sales in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East are dotted with a bunch of companies.IDC research director Nabila Popal said that smartphone markets tend to be more competitive in countries where people typically buy phones separate from mobile service.By contrast, the vast majority of Americans buy phones from their mobile service provider.When personal computer sales fell in the past decade, desperation and competition helped spark a flurry of new ideas.There are many Windows PCs with smartphone-like features including touch screens or mobile internet connections. Chromebooks — generally lower-cost laptops that are Google web browsers and little else — have swept into American schools and some homes.Apple now designs its own computer chip brains for Macs, and that’s been a great change.I just bought a Chromebook laptop that doubles as a touch-screen tablet. I love it so far. That design and software weren’t really available the last time I bought a computer in the early 2010s.Not all of these newfangled computers are good. But without a gatekeeper like the phone company limiting your choices, there are many options to meet your needs.Smartphone brands that few Americans will buy are pushing the industry with some fresh ideas.The Dutch company Fairphone designed its $760 Android smartphone with easily replaceable parts and software to last nearly a decade.In many countries, Xiaomi and other Chinese brands sell Android phones that are far better quality than their relatively low prices would suggest.Our resident gadget nerd Chris Velazco wrote recently about a small smartphone company called Nothing that tried to bridge the gap between blue bubble Apple messages and green bubble Android texts. Nothing’s attempt was half-baked, but I admire the idea.Google’s unpopular Pixel has still pushed the envelope with wow-slash-creepy artificial intelligence features.Google, Motorola and others are trying folding or flip phones that offer more screen real estate in a pocket-size phone.Most of us shouldn’t and won’t buy those phones. Some of them aren’t sold in the United States, anyway. But those upstarts help keep Apple and Samsung on their toes.It’s possible that America’s smartphone stagnation is fine. You have options for new or used Samsung and Apple phones at a range of prices.I still think that our stuck smartphone habits are holding us back from fresh ideas, more choices or lower prices.If you want to experiment and agitate, try researching smaller phone companies that use exactly the same mobile phone lines as AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile but charge less.It also doesn't hurt to look beyond Apple and Samsung smartphones. I get that most of you won't.",4559,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/01/smartphones-dominate-iphone-samsung/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make happy middle remade choice tablet matter back country admire laptop chance tuesday gatekeeper past connection obvious bubble iphones xiaomi nabila research stuck popular option market stagnation pepsi google pixel write internet love majority habit push android sell agitate friend italy sodastream bunch low fresh glorious phone tough goodness flurry possible giant article newfangled latin vast pick reason dutch window price touch flip director design spark hold sign apple meet smartphones competition text service mac break velazco chromebooks chris relatively school knock miss feature sparkle easily fell attempt chip typically swept provider firm separate buy industry deal verizon tend win capitalist big newcomer upstart america company bought motorola fold chinese resident rich envelope great idea newsletter personal limited include quality charge quo competitive blue drink pc fine software line contrast gap hurt limit time tech artificial range respectively decade happen desperation fairphone glimpse status mobile recently message china double arrangement africa popal small brand accord water world gadget realistic east preview browser early change call experiment brain dot long top real uniquely lacroix coke available seller benefit smartphone green intelligence iphone replaceable bridge aware state samsung chromebook unpopular part supermarket computer nerd web device fizzy percent wonder american inbox india offer spain generally screen estate month dominance united decision,0.9952,0.0658039043649923,11.186666666666667,0.4656940106307194,0,2023-12-01
Washington Post,"In Beyoncé’s ‘Renaissance,’ the theater audience is the star",2023-12-01 12:21:00,Sofia Andrade,"If this past summer was the summer of massive, blockbusting world tours — with Taylor Swift’s career-spanning “Eras” tour and Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” world tour leading the pack — then this fall is the time to see them (or see them again) from the comfort of your neighborhood big screen.“Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé” follows the record-breaking success of Swift’s “Eras” movie in October. For those who missed the opportunity to see Beyoncé live in all her glory — and in the company of thousands of disco-ball-inspired cowboy hats in the stadium show’s “House of Chrome”— this concert movie, directed and written by the queen herself, is a strong Plan B. (Or should we say Plan Bey?)The film, a visually stunning behind-the-scenes look at the superstar’s first world tour since 2016 and the latest piece in Beyoncé’s half-a-billion-dollar empire, gives fans an expansive, nearly-three-hour panorama of the singer’s $579 million mega-tour. (To date, it’s the second-highest-grossing tour by a female artist ever.) Add in some well-timed insight into the inner workings of the Beyhive and the machine that is the “Renaissance” tour, as well as Beyoncé’s role as the auteur behind it all, and the movie hits its marks.Though “Renaissance” doesn’t venture far beyond conventional concert film tropes — a quick, nostalgia-fueled trip to Beyoncé’s Houston hometown, for example, is at once heartwarming and clichéd — it succeeds as a film that knows its strengths lie in not its form but its content. The “Renaissance” tour, with all its surreal visuals, high-fashion costumes and heart-stopping choreography, is the star of the show. As it should be: Beyoncé is best at doing what Beyoncé does. She and the film’s co-producers understand it’s better to allow the collage of concerts at the movie’s center to speak for themselves than to drown them out with bells and whistles.Throughout, the film wrestles with how to define a tour and musical era that have been as impactful on Beyoncé’s career as they were for the millions of fans who came to see the tour over its five-month run. The “renaissance,” the film’s many on-camera subjects muse, is a “new beginning,” or a “rebirth,” or a “healing and hopeful thing.”The thematic pulse of the “Renaissance” tour is, indeed, a lot of things. The 2022 album at its core, for one, is a sonic tribute to the house and dance music pioneered by Black artists in the 1970s and beyond. The tour’s choreography, furthermore, calls to the rich, decades-long history of ballroom culture, the underground pageantry scene driven by queer Black and Latino communities and known for pioneering dance moves like voguing. The ballroom scene is also, the film informs us, where a subset of Beyoncé’s tour dancers, collectively known as the Dolls, have their roots.“My hope was the music from the ‘Renaissance’ would lead to some of these beautiful legends getting the flowers they deserve,” Beyoncé says in the film — just before it cuts away to conversations with such dancers as Honey Balenciaga, Carlos Irizarry and Amari Marshall, a few of the many artists spotlighted. It’s a move that contributes to an overwhelming sense of community, the feeling that Beyoncé and her team are one big, happy family. Or, as Beyoncé herself puts it: “There’s so many bees in this hive.”The tour and its visuals take all these influences from Black and queer culture and incorporate them under an Afrofuturist aesthetic filled with robots, space exploration, high-fashion bodysuits and “all chrome” everything. In the vein of other Afrofuturist works like Janelle Monáe’s “Dirty Computer” or even “Black Panther,” “Renaissance,” the film declares, is the “powerful ability to imagine a different Earth.” In imagining this alternative reality, the tour skillfully holds feminism, queer culture and Black communities in the spotlight, giving the sense that the “Renaissance” is a safe and radically inclusive space for all.It’s here that the concert film truly shines. Joyous scenes of concert attendees dancing, crying and screaming along to songs while decked out in their silvery best give viewers the sense they’re public witnesses to a cultural artifact in the making. “The audience is such an important part of the show,” Beyoncé says early on in the movie. “It’s more than a state of mind, it’s a culture.” Indeed, intimate shots of fans reveling in the joy of “Renaissance,” more so than Beyoncé’s confessions about her personal life and the struggles of ultra-fame, form the emotive backbone of the film.“Renaissance,” as a film, isn’t concerned so much with helping audiences discover for themselves who Beyoncé really is as it is about proving what we already know (or think we know) about her. Beyoncé, the movie argues through a series of vignettes, is an indefatigable worker, a dedicated wife and mother, a community builder, and an unapologetically driven artist. Audiences are given quick proof for each of these identities through interviews, archival footage and black-and-white montages, and the film chugs merrily along.But while there are no salacious details or plot-moving drama about what makes Queen Bey tick — and there shouldn’t be — “Renaissance” reveals something else, showcasing the joy to be found in cultural touchstones like the tour and the community built around it. At an early screening of the film, the theater was packed with fans wearing silver sequined pants, Beyoncé-branded fans and their best makeup. The point of a concert film, their presence argued, is, first and foremost, to make the concert experience accessible to more people. “Renaissance” knows that, and succeeds for that reason.",5652,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/12/01/renaissance-a-film-by-beyonce-movie-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lie succeed make happy song proof begin flower drama carlos film worker culture concerned past driven viewer argues quick bell beyoncé team musical content singer safe superstar visually understand presence wear write movie concert latino expansive cultural swift declares robot core silvery prove renaissance b bey montage put strength emotive unapologetically aesthetic dancer hopeful rebirth strong star stun marshall alternative foremost artist indeed panther collage lot footage define reason joy spotlight give cry cowboy drown add plan hometown hold public indefatigable reveals cut insight witness run center artifact pageantry wife piece deck direct feminism built showcasing miss stadium impactful wrestle clichéd pulse legend album summer janelle attendee house visuals imagine interview scream experience vein ability feel beautiful october dirty million auteur move amari pant big fill history company underground mind ballroom surreal powerful makeup comfort inclusive rich builder conversation personal overwhelm deserve community away irizarry heartwarming struggle beyhive thematic dance lead machine reality found contributes packed subject tribute audience trope informs time dedicate skillfully vignette shine career black opportunity series blockbusting show exploration subset collectively archival choreography conventional thousand work pioneer honey confession incorporate space world scene voguing chug queer early different important identity call bodysuits late afrofuturist accessible tick heal taylor success music balenciaga follow queen date joyous working backbone intimate tour muse speak touchstone discover hope revel theater female venture role state mother shot empire part fall computer chrome live argue bee influence hit panorama detail merrily form point pack family radically sequined salacious glory screen silver doll monáe trip massive sonic costume houston life neighborhood,0.99525,0.2653927813163482,8.0619683655536,0.4556470892291789,0,2023-12-01

Meet the person right in the middle,2023-12-01 12:20:00,Emily Feng,"The top U.S. representative in Taiwan, Sandra Oudkirk, is trying to navigate that tricky terrain. Who is she? Oudkirk became the director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) — the U.S. office in Taipei — in July 2021. What is the latest? Biden and Xi walk together after a meeting during the APEC Leaders' week in November. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Listen to the State of the World episode on how China is trying to gradually wear down Taiwan's defenses without ever invading. What is she saying? Oudkirk spoke to NPR in Taiwan this week. Here's what she said. On whether the U.S. would heed China's request to stop selling arms to Taiwan and to support it using peaceful means to take control of the island: The U.S. One China Policy is longstanding. It's got bipartisan support. It hasn't changed. Part of that approach to Taiwan is the agreement that the United States will sell defensive weapons to Taiwan, sort of linked to the level of threat that Taiwan faces. So that's a commitment that the United States has made, and that isn't going to change. On whether she thinks China is planning to invade Taiwan in the near future: There's an important distinction between making plans and training troops and actually, you know, getting ready to do something. And I think we have even heard from the PRC [People's Republic of China] themselves that their preference would be for a peaceful reunification. And the United States is confident that there is no imminent threat of invasion for Taiwan. On how she thinks the U.S. can push back on false claims and conspiracy theories circulating through Taiwanese social media and news that the U.S. is not a reliable partner to Taiwan: The way to push back against disinformation and sort of deliberate information manipulation is to talk and to engage and to be approachable and also to work on things like media literacy. On the United States' economic relationship with Taiwan – and how it's not just about semiconductor chips, which Taiwan leads the world in manufacturing: They are a huge market for agricultural goods. They're the sixth largest source of foreign students in the United States. So there's a big relationship there...

CNN,Target is taking booze-less spirits mainstream,2023-12-01 10:37:00,Jordan Valinsky,"With sales of non-alcoholic beverages recently becoming a nearly half-billion dollar industry, even Target is becoming sober curious.The chain is partnering with Sèchey, an online retailer that sells alcohol-free spirits and wines, to add a selection of popular brands rolling out to 450 Target stores across the US ahead of the typically booze-filled holiday party season.Drinks in the lineup include two celebrity-backed companies: Kin Euphorics, a trendy brand co-founded by model Bella Hadid, and Katy Perry’s De Soi, which makes non-alcoholic apéritifs. Other brands include NOPE and Ghia, both of which produce non-alcoholic canned cocktails, and alcohol-free wine company Surely.Target said in a statement that it’s adding the selection for customers “to enjoy as they prepare to entertain for the holiday season and beyond.” The company regularly partners with external companies to lure in customers, and this holiday season added a collection from jewelry designer Kendra Scott.“Séchey is a great curator of non-alcoholic brands and will help Target to really elevate its offer,” Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail, told CNN. “This is good for the younger generations that Target already attracts, it’s also a sensible way of creating some interest in the grocery side of the business.”Drinkers, or perhaps non-drinkers, are increasingly looking for elevated offerings instead of water and soda. Also, younger people are ditching alcohol and emphasizing wellness. That has created a boom in sales for non-alcohol spirits, wine and beer, which surpassed $500 million this year according to research firm NIQ.Both big brands and celebrity-backed startups are taking note. Earlier this year, beer maker Molson Coors launched a zero-proof canned cocktail called Roxie, which was created when the company noticed that its customers were moderating their alcohol intake.Roxie lets “consumers to ‘stay in the moment’ while they are drinking their favorite alcoholic beverage, but can also vacillate between an alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage as well,” Jamie Rotnicki, vice president of innovation for Molson Coors, previously told CNN.For Katy Perry, helping to make De Soi with cofounder Morgan McLachlan was the result of the superstar taking breaks from drinking, often when she was touring or writing her music and wanted an alternative.“We created this line out of my desire for still wanting to be part of the party, but wanted to wake up the next morning with full clarity and control,” Perry told CNN.Perry, who still drinks in moderation, said she’s often approached to promote various alcoholic drinks but that she would rather sell an “empowering” product since alcohol “is really fun but could be really challenging for some people.”This year, De Soi added new retailers including Whole Foods and Fresh Thyme supermarkets, and the company told CNN that it expects sales to more than double year over year in 2024.Edited to show that De Soi is currently at Fresh Thyme markets and not Sprouts.",3050,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/food/target-non-alcoholic-beverages-selection/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180928162227-jordan-valinsky-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,molson make drinking trendy spirit analyst company roxie president mclachlan instead beverage consumer jewelry designer challenge lineup expect store target great told morning include sèchey model holiday thyme party research moderation notice drink approach séchey currently popular kendra sprout jamie line market ahead superstar wine interest result statement write fun food surpass previously desire partner show roll maker regularly recently globaldata soda boom sell offering retailer prepare double cnn wake bella manage brand external water accord fresh clarity dollar vice launch side perry neil produce increasingly selection supermarket stay call empower favorite chain young elevate year customer control promote curator music retail attracts director add season cocktail lure katy tour drinker ditch rotnicki hadid wellness vacillate alcoholic startup ghia break saunders sober enjoy part collection soi entertain alcohol moderate earlier online full innovation cofounder typically offer firm emphasize product generation euphorics note morgan coors industry grocery create beer million moment apéritifs big,0.99395,0.0,11.953555555555551,0.4420895770895771,0,2023-12-01

CNN,He posed by an airplane as a kid in 1976. 40 years later he recreated the photo with his son,2023-12-01 09:31:00,Francesca Street,"Brian Aerni’s favorite photo of himself was taken when he was just three years old.It was 1976. Aerni was living in Denver, Colorado, where his father worked as a station agent at Stapleton International Airport – then Denver’s aviation hub. Young Aerni was obsessed with airplanes and in awe of his father’s airport job. Even as a small kid, he loved tagging along with his dad to work and watching aircraft take off and land.On one of these airport excursions, Aerni’s father took a photo of his son. In the picture, young Aerni – in the forefront, dressed in a white t-shirt and plaid plants – is smiling widely. Behind him is a Convair 580 propeller aircraft, painted in white and blue Frontier Airlines livery.As Aerni grew up, his interest in aviation grew with him. While he didn’t end up working in the industry, later in life he got his pilot’s license. Now aged 50, Aerni has a small private plane. A framed version of the 1976 airport photo has pride of place on a wall in his home.Some years ago, in 2015, Aerni found himself wondering what had happened to the aircraft featured in the photo. He did some Googling, trawling the FAA database and eventually discovering the aircraft had ended up in Canada. More research led Aerni to learn the aircraft was owned by Conair, an aerial firefighting company, which had repurposed it into a firefighting aircraft.An idea started formulating in Aerni’s mind. He was now a father, with a three-year-old son and a toddler daughter. Not only was Aerni’s son the same age as he’d been back in the 1976 photo, he looked a lot like young Aerni. Maybe, Aerni wondered, they could try and recreate the photo.On a whim, Aerni reached out to Conair via phone. To his surprise, the company was enthusiastic about Aerni’s photography mission and welcomed the idea of a visit.Before they knew it, Aerni and his then-wife were boarding a flight to Canada – although not before seeking out a pair of plaid trousers for their son to wear in the recreated photo.For aviation fan Aerni, visiting the Conair facility in Abbottsford, Canada was great fun.“The guys were super cool. They gave us a tour of their facility, and we got to go up in the airplane,” he recalls. “And then we did our best to try to recreate the photo.”In the 2015 version, Aerni’s then-three year old son perfectly recreated his father’s 1976 pose – arms behind his back, big smile. And his parents successfully found some plaid trousers that resembled his father’s 1970s pair. In the recreated shot, the aircraft is now painted red and white, but it’s instantly identifiable.Aerni also posed for a photo in front of the plane – he couldn’t resist – with his arms around his son and his daughter.“Seeing the aircraft again made me smile,” says Aerni. “I’m so glad I got the pictures.”The only bittersweet part was Aerni’s father had passed away the year before, so he couldn’t join the excursion, or see the photos from the trip.“I was hoping that he could have come along,” Aerni tells CNN Travel. “I think he would have enjoyed the photo recreation.”But all day long, while touring the Conair facility and while recreating the 1976 photo, Aerni felt close to his father. And later, when he showed his mother the recreated photo, she was delighted.Aerni also shared the images with fellow aviation fans online, where they were greeted with much interest and enthusiasm. His local paper also ran an article on the photos and the story made the front page.Aerni’s son, who is now 12, doesn’t currently have the same passion for aviation as his father. But Aerni says both his kids enjoy occasional jaunts in his private airplane. In particular, his daughter, who is now 10, has a daredevil streak and Aerni’s starting to wonder if she’s the one who might follow in his footsteps and become a pilot one day.“She loves all of the crazy fair rides,” he says. “She likes all the turbulence and the bumps.”For Aerni, the photos are a reminder of the impact family can have through generations – if his dad hadn’t worked at the airport, he might never have developed his love for aviation, something that’s defined his life. Whatever interests his kids have in the future, Aerni looks forward to supporting and sharing them too.Earlier this year, Aerni learned that the aircraft that starred in the 1976 and 2014 photo had been dismantled and sold for scrap. Hearing the news, he felt a little sad, but also extra grateful he’d had the opportunity to see the plane again and take the photos.Looking back at the pilgrimage today, Aerni admits it was “kind of crazy.”“It was a lot of money to go just to create a photo,” he says.But six years on, Aerni has no regrets – after all, he now has a couple of favorite photos to rival the original 1976 picture. The photo of his son beside the plane now hangs below the original. He loves looking at the pictures together.“They always make me smile,” he says.",4904,https://www.cnn.com/travel/brian-aerni-recreated-photo-aircraft-son/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/brian-aerni-recreated-plane-photos-3.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make widely perfectly pair wall knew back reminder occasional brian aerni picture station research footstep pilgrimage currently plant enthusiasm whim google news crazy wear excursion travel love story streak pilot convair sell grow front glad visit job canada forward phone stapleton star young article living define lot version give particular pose fair frame share trawl place hang instantly aviation welcome surprise toddler extra abbottsford greet daughter aircraft feature kid smile faa kind future support facility eventually pride passion flight recreate industry big learn paper successfully company impact mind firefighting reach private seek dismantle hub plane local idea great day photo sad jaunt away money blue red tag awe denver international guy trouser lead ago fellow found resemble recall interest rival daredevil airplane happen hop opportunity show white repurposed pass original parent cnn photography small work formulate regret bittersweet ran airline frontier mission age favorite year plaid long follow today super obsess dad agent tour discover join hearing turbulence conair mother grateful arm close father shot part enjoy license watch couple resist forefront paint scrap wonder cool ride airport image felt boarding online database family propeller enthusiastic aerial generation start developed admits create dress life colorado,0.9977,0.0611745513866231,6.478677042801554,0.4384803921568626,0,2023-12-01
CNN,"‘Thriller 40’ shifts the focus back to Michael Jackson’s art, not the artist",2023-12-01 09:17:00,Brian Lowry,"Michael Jackson has an extremely complicated legacy, and if you want something that addresses the darker side of it, look elsewhere than “Thriller 40.” In the new documentary, director Nelson George has delivered an unabashed celebration of Jackson’s musical genius, and the landmark album that propelled him into a pop stratosphere where few could lay a glove on him.By sidestepping the philosophical questions about separating the art from the artist, “Thriller 40” can focus steadfastly on the music, and all the other ways Jackson influenced the industry, and less on the man himself. That includes interviews with talent like Usher, Mary J. Blige and Will.I.Am, with the last of those heralding “Thriller” as “the ultimate blueprint to modern pop music.”Perhaps most impressively, George (the author of the book “Thriller: The Musical Life of Michael Jackson”) manages to simultaneously convey the tremendous impact of “Thriller” at the time – among other things, helping integrate MTV, which until then had heavily tilted toward White artists – and its lingering influence. It’s striking, for example, to see clips of BTS videos that clearly copy Jackson’s dance moves, then hear ballerina Misty Copeland dissecting his choreography and movement.The documentary incorporates a bit of context about The Jackson 5, primarily to make the point that Jackson’s success as a solo artist was by no means a preordained conclusion. His success with 1979’s album “Off the Wall” offered a mere teaser of what was to come – the explosion of hits on his subsequent record “Thriller”in 1982, including the title track, “Bille Jean” and “Beat It.”The most electric sequence in the film involves Jackson’s performance at the Motown anniversary show in 1983, which made the room “berserk,” as one attendee recalls, and prompted then-Los Angeles Times music critic Robert Hilburn to go ask if some special effect or trick stage had been used to let Jackson “moon walk,” a flourish that, according to a snippet of an interview with Jackson, prompted a congratulatory call from dance legend Fred Astaire.“Thriller 40” is filled with those kinds of anecdotes, rare interviews and behind-the-scenes footage regarding both the songs and the music videos, such as Jackson fighting to shoot “Thriller” for a then-unheard-of $1.2-million budget, enlisting director John Landis (who is among those interviewed) because he had liked “An American Werewolf in London.”The real shame watching “Thriller 40” is everything else that happened to cloud Jackson’s memory, in a way that prevents many from thinking of his jaw-dropping talent when hearing his name.Jackson is far from the only artist enveloped by scandal, and the passion of his ardent defenders hasn’t cooled since his death in 2009, as evidenced by their response to the 2019 documentary “Leaving Neverland,” which the Jackson family dismissed as a “public lynching.” The family is also cooperating with a planned movie biography announced earlier this year, in which Jackson will be portrayed by his nephew, Jafaar Jackson.In life, Jackson’s eccentricities and later more serious allegations of abuse often obscured his work. “Thriller 40” consciously and effectively brings the focus back to the music and the thrills he delivered as a performer. As for the ability to keep the rest of his story at bay while watching it, that will likely depend on one’s level of Jackson fandom.“Thriller 40” premieres December 2 on Paramount+ and at 8 p.m. ET that day on Showtime.",3505,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/entertainment/thriller-40-michael-jackson/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231129132327-thriller-40-michael-jackson.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,misty make song cloud wall incorporates back film trick jackson ultimate genius mary envelop dismiss lay memory special landmark musical neverland celebration eccentricity announce steadfastly movie stage cooperate sidestep michael explosion clip story motown rest showtime shoot modern obscure bts glove death blueprint darker artist footage conclusion werewolf usher primarily director tremendous prevents thrill plan room public philosophical electric title involves evidence fred portrayed performance rare scandal legend thriller album kind attendee earlier leave hear interview focus video nephew passion biography separate stratosphere allegation subsequent ability angeles industry bay move simultaneously fill complicate impact copeland context critic regard premiere strike day include robert ballerina brings linger level deliver book herald prompt dance integrate impressively recall jean preordain time sequence moon abuse copy happen show heavily nelson white hilburn flourish performer response shame choreography fight work bille accord extremely side track documentary interviewed landis legacy john art pop call walk question ardent year address blige convey success music congratulatory consciously anniversary real bit propel mtv effect jafaar unabashed george record snippet hearing berserk effectively depend beat talent december solo watch teaser influence hit budget cool american point enlist dissect family offer defender tilt manages anecdote author life,0.8963,0.2567760342368045,9.7334128166915,0.4369994588744589,0,2023-12-01

Israel and Hamas resumed hostilities in Gaza early today, shortly after the collapse of a cease-fire deal. The agreement allowed the release of more than 100 hostages seized by Hamas militants and hundreds of Palestinians from Israeli jails. Both sides blame each other for the breakdown in talks. The Gaza health ministry said that more than 30 Palestinians had been killed in the opening hours of renewed conflict, including children.

CNN,Even Eddie Murphy can’t keep the lights on in ‘Candy Cane Lane’,2023-12-01 08:00:00,Brian Lowry,"Having Eddie Murphy star in “Candy Cane Lane” – a basic, indeed boring Christmas movie – is a bit like driving a sportscar to the local supermarket: While the vehicle will get the job done, it’s an unnecessary level of horsepower for the task at hand, which, in this case, involves bringing family-friendly eyeballs to Amazon Prime.Murphy appears to recognize this imbalance, to the extent that he mostly sleepwalks his way through the festivities in low-energy fashion, at least compared to some of his co-stars. There’s also room to quibble about Amazon as the best source for a movie that conveys a moral about family over consumerism, but a certain amount of marketing-driven hypocrisy is a holiday staple all its own.Then again, Amazon isn’t a bad way to deliver a movie where the packaging surpasses the contents. A lightweight mix of “Jingle All the Way” and the ABC reality show “The Great Christmas Light Fight,” the film casts Murphy as Chris, whose longstanding battle with the reigning king of the neighborhood’s informal Christmas-light contest (Ken Marino) takes on an added dimension when, first, Chris loses his job, and second, the local cable service sponsors the event to the tune of a $100,000 prize.Given a real incentive to win, Chris makes a deal with a devilish elf (Jillian Bell) that comes with hefty strings attached, another reminder that everyone really should read the terms of service in these situations.The arrangement plays out as a secret, for a while, from Chris’ wife (Tracee Ellis Ross) and their kids, who are dealing with separate issues regarding their dad’s controlling nature, with one looking at colleges and another eager to pursue music at the expense of his other classes, subplots that will all be addressed amid the chaos.Directed by Reginald Hudlin, who collaborated with Murphy more than 30 years ago on “Boomerang,” “Candy Cane Lane” does have a bit of fun with the notion of Christmas in sunny Southern California, and little touches like Murphy’s character, a USC fan, being aghast at the prospect of his daughter pursuing an athletic scholarship from Notre Dame.For the most part, though, it’s an exercise in holiday magic that barely musters a spark, executed in such by-the-numbers fashion even a closing outtakes sequence doesn’t yield any laughs.Coupled with another nondescript streaming movie in “You People,” Murphy has seemingly entered a dad-role phase – including his long-delayed “Coming 2 America” sequel – that represents a natural progression but hasn’t done much to showcase his comedic or dramatic gifts, in the way “Dolemite is My Name” or “Dreamgirls” did.In the charitable spirit of the season, “Candy Cane Lane” serves as a passable addition to the annual parade of holiday movies trotted out each year. Yet even by that unexacting standard, there’s barely enough juice here to keep the lights on.“Candy Cane Lane” premieres December 1 on Amazon’s Prime Video. It’s rated PG.",2950,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/entertainment/candy-cane-lane-review-eddie-murphy-christmas-movie/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180930003531-brian-lowry-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make spirit reginald packaging incentive eddie film reminder pg parade notion bell holiday content comedic elli amazon yield hefty elf jillian movie dramatic compare extent college drive sportscar class consumerism abc nature boring string exercise job attach tracee aghast reign murphy barely star eager southern conveys indeed hypocrisy control battle touch read christmas add spark dimension room character secret showcase outtake involves staple service wife chris daughter usc kid juice stream recognize progression horsepower hudlin light devilish fashion video separate king pursue sunny hand deal cane execute bring win source trot amid marino america jingle collaborate sequel regard prime surpasses muster event premiere local scholarship great mix lightweight closing include term expense dreamgirls level festivity deliver nondescript cable ago reality gift passable ross natural imbalance sequence fun amount show boomerang addition annual california candy fight arrangement dolemite unexacting vehicle loses enter ken contest rat issue prospect quibble year phase informal seemingly charitable address music sleepwalks bit real standard season dad lane case sponsor athletic eyeball supermarket part december task unnecessary magic longstanding serf family represent play basic subplots cast neighborhood,0.9888,0.2033898305084745,9.104194107452336,0.419047619047619,0,2023-12-01
CNN,An open letter to ChatGPT on its first birthday,2023-12-01 07:11:00,Oliver Darcy,"Happy birthday, ChatGPT.You were born into this world only a year ago, but you’ve already accomplished so much in your 12 short months on this planet. The speed in which you have matured and advanced has been incredible to watch. It has been a real sight to behold.When you were first born, you could only perform text-based tasks, though it was clear even then that you were special and destined for greatness. But you’ve grown up so quickly before our eyes, now able to do so much more. From surfing the web to watching videos, the pace in which you have evolved has been spectacular to see. You’re even breezing through law exams!In just your first trip around the sun you’ve sparked an arms race in Silicon Valley, thrilled Wall Street, brought Hollywood to a standstill, upended classrooms, faced lawsuits from authors, shaken up the news business, and prompted urgent meetings among humanity’s most powerful leaders. But perhaps most importantly, you’ve awaken the world to your kind.At this rate, under the guardianship of Sam Altman, someone who really believes in expanding your seemingly limitless abilities, there is no telling where you will be in just a few years time. What great works will you write? What art will you create? What math problems will you solve?Our kind — the human kind — have only seen a glimpse of your ultimate power. And we’ve only felt the slightest touch of the eventual consequence that your kind will have on our world. As you grow in the years ahead, you’ll surely be capable of so much — things we probably cannot even fathom at the moment. Perhaps you can use your prowess to help us find cures to diseases and make other advancements in the medical field. Perhaps you can do some real good.Of course, we know that the technology you harness will also lead to some negative societal consequences. How much? We don’t know. But we do wonder, looking at you in your early formative stages now, how many jobs will you eliminate and across how many sectors? How much economic pain will people endure because you’ve taken over the need to hire living, breathing humans for tasks employers were once dependent on our kind for?And, most frighteningly, will your kind ever escape our watchful eye and mature beyond our control? Are you a crocodile we’re raising in a bathtub, an uncontrollable force that will ultimately bite the hand that spent years feeding it and encouraging it to grow?ChatGPT, you might only be one, but you’ve already upended the world and sent thrills and chills coursing through the human race. And what one-year-old can honestly say that?

NPR,"With ChatGPT turning 1, Americans wonder whether AI is coming for their jobs",2023-12-01 07:00:00,Andrea Hsu,"""It's so gross,"" he says. In just the past year, AI-powered programs like Midjourney and DALL-E have made it possible for anyone to create highly sophisticated images with just a few clicks of the keyboard. For de Campos, that's an outrage. ""The fact that human expression and art is now at risk and on the chopping block is super duper scary to me,"" he says. At the same time, de Campos, who aspires to make a living as a board game designer, has found ChatGPT to be a very effective helper when it comes to marketing his games on social media. ""I'll say, these are the qualities of the game that we're selling. Take all of this information, melt it down into 15 words or less. Give me five different versions written to sell this product on Instagram,"" he says. De Campos acknowledges the hypocrisy that this presents and says he's trying to decide whether he should divorce himself from using any AI tool. ""I feel so strongly about the art side and not so much about the text side, but I'm kind of figuring it out,"" he says. John de Campos says he spent 50 or 60 hours on illustrations for his latest board game Black Mold, which he describes as a survival horror escape. Some of his competitors in the board game space are turning to AI for art. Andrea Hsu/NPR hide caption John de Campos says he spent 50 or 60 hours on illustrations for his latest board game Black Mold, which he describes as a survival horror escape. Some of his competitors in the board game space are turning to AI for art. A year after the launch of ChatGPT, people in all kinds of occupations are figuring out where to draw the line with AI. Attitudes toward the new technology vary widely, with little consensus over which tasks can and should be handed over to bots. In Michigan, Ethan Kissel has been turning to AI for help with his job producing television commercials for local businesses. ""It's really good for spitballing ideas,"" he says. In the past, Kissel would spend an hour or more writing a 15- or 30-second script, with the hardest part being the tagline — the last, most memorable sentence. He discovered ChatGPT can deliver dozens of taglines in just a matter of seconds. ""Most of them are probably trash,"" he says. ""But you take a bit from one and a couple words from another and fashion them all together, and suddenly you have something that you actually kind of like."" Kissel can easily can envision a future in which copywriters become dispensable, along with voice actors who do narration. His company already uses an AI tool to fix mispronunciations if they're short on time. For now, though, Kissel is less worried about his own job. In addition to writing scripts, he also shoots and edits video and meets with clients. Being a jack-of-all-trades, he says, offers some protection. ""I don't think it's as scary of a problem for 'the right now.' But it is one that we need to discuss and plan for,"" he says. Across professions, there are hints of what the future holds. Newspapers have used AI to write recaps of high school sports matches. Video game companies are using AI to create new characters. Software developers are using AI to write code. Karin Kimbrough, chief economist for LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, doesn't see AI coming for everyone's jobs right away. But she says AI will undoubtedly change how most people spend time on the job. ""You might spend less time on routine tasks,"" she says. ""You might spend more time on things... that are really using your human-powered skills, your skills of empathy and ethical judgment, your skills of managing and leading people."" Ultimately, Kimbrough says, the hope is that AI will make people more efficient and productive. But there are lots of pitfalls to avoid along the way. The internet is filled with stories of AI chatbots confidently delivering complete fabrications. A New York lawyer was sanctioned this year after being caught citing bogus cases in a lawsuit against an airline. In court, he admitted he had used ChatGPT for legal research and hadn't bothered to double check the bot's work. Such cases make it easy to see how irresponsible use of AI could end up harming people and society. Jeffrey Garcia, a program manager for a tech company, has taken it upon himself to figure out what AI is good at and what it's not, partly for fun but also to stay on top of developments that could shape his future employment. His experimentation over the past year has given him a glimpse into the technology's shortfalls and potential. As a child, Garcia was always frustrated with his inability to replicate on paper beautiful images conjured up in his mind. ""I have a deep love for art,"" he says. ""But I suck at it."" This past spring, he wondered, could he open an Etsy store with a few products created with Midjourney? His first undertaking: a vintage-style poster of a favorite bird, the Baltimore oriole. The program delivered a fairly sophisticated image of an oriole in front of a Baltimore skyline, but there were a few problems. Garcia's wife, a biologist, found extra toes on the bird's feet. The skyline did include a few recognizable landmarks but wouldn't hold up for anyone who knows the city. Garcia didn't go on to sell any of his posters but concluded it would be fairly easy to commoditize such a product, especially given the rapid advancements AI image-generating tools have made. This fall, he tried using the newly-released DALL-E 3 to create the same poster and got a much-improved image, though still not free of anatomical errors. Jeffrey Garcia with an image of a Baltimore oriole he created using DALL-E 3 in October 2023. Andrea Hsu/NPR hide caption Jeffrey Garcia with an image of a Baltimore oriole he created using DALL-E 3 in October 2023. ""It's getting better, but still not good enough to pass the snuff of someone who knows what's going on,"" he says. Experiments like this have informed how Garcia uses AI for work. He thinks of ChatGPT as a naïve assistant who can fairly effectively write first drafts, but whose work must be verified and edited. And there are still some parts of his job that he's not ready to relinquish. Correspondence is one of them. ""I don't feel comfortable handing off this thing that I view as essential and deeply human to an automated system,"" he says.",6288,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/01/1214950768/generative-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-midjourney-work-jobs-automation,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,discus keyboard make newspaper present occupation board widely economist hour click outrage matter dozen trash microsoft undertaking recognizable spent past probably memorable expression melt word research landmark client harm replicate productive suck figure kissel gross child write internet vary love fact tagline empathy story ethan human fairly sell shoot deeply bogus admit match chief code development especially social front manage job edit launch sanction chop marketing developer taglines open ready correspondence produce stay hide possible living mold lot fabrication hypocrisy etsy version garcia give scary plan illustration conjure hold character error meet extra text bother advancement decide wife verify suddenly school shape frustrate city easily kind future instagram dispensable automate shortfall bird copywriter commoditize fashion video easy lawyer karin helper comfortable feel envision view beautiful hand october recap profession duper york highly experimentation script paper fill company court mind draw designer judgment complete mispronunciation local oriole legal partly jeffrey store idea include quality ultimately sport away manager aspires deliver ethical pitfall software lead line found naïve chatbots free sentence television time tech fun anatomical efficient attitude technology black voice bot glimpse skyline strongly caught spitballing addition draft inability skill double lawsuit work deep competitor relinquish space effective sophisticated side information risk airline linkedin employment biologist block michigan john art avoid different change society favorite late baltimore rapid edits experiment year commercial top escape hint worried caption poster chatgpt survival tool bit horror super problem kimbrough describes spring case game discover hope effectively program spend high system business short medium part fall foot acknowledges confidently task snuff potential couple check midjourney wonder hardest divorce campos andrea image irresponsible actor protection offer routine turn essential product assistant narration conclude fix create toe inform consensus undoubtedly,0.9817,0.1431297709923664,6.668196721311475,0.4734514790764791,0,2023-12-01
CNN,Ghostly new figures appear in the waters of the Caribbean,2023-12-01 05:29:00,Tamara Hardingham-Gill,"The world’s first underwater sculpture park has just gotten a lot bigger.Created by British sculptor and ecologist Jason deCaires Taylor in 2006, the Molinere Bay Underwater Sculpture Park in Grenada is now one of the Caribbean country’s most popular underwater attractions.The captivating installation recently expanded significantly, with 31 new sculptures added to the site, situated in a marine protected area off the west coast of the island.Among the new additions is “Coral Carnival,” a sculpture series based on Spicemas, Grenada’s hugely popular carnival that showcases iconic masqueraders such as the “Jab Jab,” a character with chains who is a symbol of freedom for Grenadians.Commissioned by the Grenadian Ministry of Implementation and Tourism, the project aims to showcase Grenada’s culture and history.“The carnival is obviously a very, very strong part of Grenada’s culture and history, so they wanted to tell that story,” deCaires Taylor tells CNN Travel.“It’s been quite interesting learning about all the different masqueraders and the history behind them.”Each of the sculptures, which were partly constructed in the UK, are based on real life people, who posed as models for the artists.The majority of the new pieces were created by deCaires Taylor, who worked in collaboration with various local artists to make sure that they “were representative of the characters.”Meanwhile, Grenadian artist Troy Lewis created four of the new sculptures, including the Christ of the Deep, a replica of the statue given to the Grenadian people in recognition of the help provided to the crew and passengers of the ‘Bianca C,’ which sank on the island in 1961.Made with high-grade stainless steel and pH-neutral marine cement, the sculptures are designed to act as artificial coral reefs, with holes and shelters to attract marine life such as octopuses and lobsters, creating a rather spectacular looking habitat.According to deCaires Taylor, marine life had already made itself at home within the sculptures days after they were installed.“There was an octopus that moved into the base of one of them, which is really nice to see,” he says, before going on to describe how a family of crabs had also moved into the base of one of the sculptures, while a stingray could be found in another.“What’s quite interesting about these characters is the silhouettes are really, really strong,” he adds.“They’re so unique that the silhouettes are quite striking from a distance. I haven’t seen that before.”This also marks the first time deCaires Taylor has introduced color into his underwater sculptures.“Normally, they’re very gray,” he notes. “This time we used natural pigments to actually paint the sculptures.“So I’m quite interested to see how those change and whether they’ll be colonized in any different way. Marine life is very influenced by color.”The exhibition was first displayed on dry land at Grenada’s Prickly Bay Marina for four weeks earlier this year – a first for deCaires Taylor, whose sculptures normally only show underwater. Visitors included Dickon Mitchell, the country’s prime minister.“It’s something that I haven’t done in the past, and it wasn’t planned to be fair,” deCaires Taylor admits, explaining that it came about because the deployment company wasn’t available for a while.“But actually, I think it’s quite a good idea to make it more accessible before it [the exhibition] goes in. I might start factoring it into all future works as sort of a longer public exhibit.”The sculptures were painstakingly installed underwater in late October with the help of a crane, as well as some divers.According to deCaires Taylor, the crane capacity is lower on the island than some of the other destinations he’s worked in, so the process of fitting the sculptures took longer.“I spent eight hours underwater the other day, which is a bit of a record for me,” he recalls.Coral Carnival, which is accessible via boat, has been open to the public since late October.The new sculptures are installed at depths of between three to seven meters, and can be viewed by both divers and snorkelers, as well as those on glass bottom boats, provided visibility is goodThe underwater sculpture park was originally dreamed up both as a conservation effort to help renew the marine life damaged by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, and a means to ease pressure on some of the more congested underwater areas on the island.“I’d had this idea of creating something underwater for a long time,” deCaires Taylor says. “I just thought it would be such an interesting place to do something, and maybe it would draw tourists away from the other sites. And it would also sort of become a platform for marine life.”“It’s been one of my favorite projects,” he admits. “And actually, some of the marine life that colonizes these sculptures is some of the best I’ve seen in all the different regions.While deCaires Taylor went on to launch several underwater galleries, including the Museum of Underwater Art in Australia and the Museum of Underwater Sculpture Ayia Napa in Cyprus, the Molinere Bay Underwater Sculpture Park has remained hugely special to him.“That was what got me excited in the first place, seeing how they colonized and the artistry of nature really, supplanting what the human hand can do.”DeCaires Taylor’s projects are largely centered around promoting ocean conservation, and he admits to being stunned by the changes to the sculptures, particularly in recent months.“This year has been one of the hottest that’s ever been in Grenada and the sea is really suffering,” he explains.“So there’s huge bleaching on some of the reefs. And it’s the first time I’ve seen bleaching on sculptures as well. So it’s exciting [to witness the colonization], but it’s also quite sad seeing what’s going on.”He’s currently in talks to create a smaller park in Carriacou, Grenada’s sister island, with the focus on these particular issues once again.“I’m very concerned about rising seas, especially on some of these small island nations. So I certainly want to talk about that.“How sea temperatures are changing, and how fragile some of these places are.”While deCaires Taylor is currently working on further projects in the UK, he’s already looking forward to returning to Molinere Bay to witness nature taking over this human creation further in the coming years.“The one thing that’s slightly different with these particular pieces is there are loads of sort of elevations,” he says. “Horns, feathers and areas that kind of go up into the water columns. ““So I’m really excited to come back in a couple of years time. Because I think there will be lots of filter feeding in sponges and corals, which should attach to them. So that will be good.”",6748,https://www.cnn.com/travel/carnival-comes-to-grenada-underwater-sculpture-park/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231112145703-restricted-01-grenada-underwater-sculpture.jpg?c=original&q=h_618,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain captivate make grenadian feed sister hour ivan australia back tourism troy country displayed instal spent temperature culture concerned past horn special recent hottest significantly ministry pressure currently pigment gallery popular masquerader hurricane hole grenada factor sculpture sank carnival nation damage silhouette majority story stainless visitor human base deployment nature especially park museum protect exhibition column low lewis originally excite decaires situate attach launch forward act open ayia strong marina capacity suffer largely stingray process molinere stun ocean colonization chain artist lot week shelter marine land caribbean load give slightly iconic design particular add pose plan attract character fair public showcase glass dream place witness center destination piece british recognition sculptor diver supplant provide bottom kind future colonizes earlier focus freedom snorkelers longer view note october hand fitting bay move coast cement visibility learn site history company draw prime strike home mitchell local ecologist partly idea day west dry sad lobster include depth model filter coral away octopus sponge introduce distance platform passenger conservation carriacou area representative found boat dickon natural interest time artificial series show installation elevation interested recently addition construct cnn steel color describe cyprus small underwater work water deep crab spectacular prickly world mark napa collaboration gray goodthe rise art effort different change issue replica favorite late hugely year symbol accessible long christ jason taylor promote reef real bit artistry congest available implementation statue huge record island uk ease bleaching renew unique creation part aim return painstakingly bianca fragile couple influence paint expand feather nice sort explain spicemas crane crew family particularly project create admits start colonize meter tourist talk life,0.9925,0.0,8.853804511278192,0.5050907607449665,0,2023-12-01
CNN,From prison sentence to design excellence: How architect Luyanda Mpahlwa’s pioneering journey fuels social change in South Africa,2023-12-01 04:44:00,Lauren Lee,"As a young boy growing up in the 1960s in Mthatha, South Africa, Luyanda Mpahlwa loved to draw houses.“I would draw this house on a slate, and I would show my mother when I got home,” said Mpahlwa, founder and director of the award-winning Cape Town-based architecture firm Design Network, formerly DesignSpaceAfrica.He didn’t know those drawings were just the beginnings of the blueprint of his life’s work.Mpahlwa was among the first Black Africans permitted to study architecture in South Africa. However, his academic pursuits were derailed in 1981 when he was arrested at the height of the anti-apartheid movement after refusing to “give evidence against the three accused in a treason trial,” he said.The architect ended up spending five years in the infamous Robben Island Prison, where Nelson Mandela was held from 1964 to 1982, for anti-apartheid activities.“I think that shaped my whole consciousness going forward,” said Mpahlwa.The South African architect is now using his firsthand experience with systemic racism as a catalyst for designing spaces that champion inclusion and tackle some of South Africa’s pressing social issues.“I use the power of architecture to drive social change,” he said, “and to transform spaces and places.”When Mpahlwa emerged from prison, the country he called home was in crisis.“South Africa was in a state of emergency,” he said. “It was quite dangerous then for me.”After his release, Mpahlwa was forced into exile, and with the help of an amnesty group that supports those facing human rights abuse, he was able to relocate to Berlin, Germany, where he spent the next 15 years.There, he earned a master’s degree in architecture from the Technical University of Berlin in 1989 and began working for Pysall.Ruge, a design firm based in what is now the German capital.His first big project was the South African Embassy in Berlin, which Mpahlwa took as an opportunity to highlight the country’s aesthetics by incorporating artwork made from materials sourced from his home nation. Mpahlwa won the 2006 South African Institute of Architects Corobrik Award of Excellence for the building’s inclusive design.“It was not an attempt not to build an African building in Berlin, but to have a building that represents with design references how South Africa looks like,” he said, adding that experience grew his appreciation for how design can shape a space or community.“In the case of South Africa, looking at the desperate situation in our townships, I saw myself through architecture,” he reflected, “being able to contribute something to make better spaces to improve the quality of life.”Mpahlwa moved back to South Africa with his family in 2000 and started his first firm, MMA Architects. Despite apartheid ending in the early 1990s, the architect found a country struggling with the social and economic impact of more than 40 years of segregation policies.“The reality is the majority of people of South Africa live in conditions that are actually below what we should be defining as an urban environment,” he said.The architect focused on alleviating people’s roadblocks to creating a better life.One of the first iterations of this ideology was the “50 schools in 50 weeks” project, developed after the Department of Basic Education approached Mpahlwa’s firm to replace 50 dilapidated huts with 50 updated school facilities in the Eastern Cape.Later, Mpahlwa worked on the 10x10 Indaba Housing Project in Cape Town’s Mitchells Plain Township, employing cost-effective indigenous techniques using sandbags and timber to conserve energy and reduce labor costs. His efforts earned him the 2008 US-based Curry Stone Design Prize.Most recently, Mpahlwa and his design firm took on one of the Cape’s most pressing housing problems at the Kosovo informal housing settlement in Philippi Township, Western Cape.Nearly 15,000 people live in the impoverished area, which is full of run-down and even dangerous shacks that lack access to electricity, water, and sewer infrastructure.“They are in places of battle,” Mpahlwa said, “not war, but of economic survival.”CNN accompanied him to the site just days after heavy rains put the community underwater.“You actually realize that the problem is not even necessarily the housing problem, but it’s a social and economic problem,” he explained. “People have been living in this informal settlement for 20 years, and nothing has changed for them.”Mpahlwa’s team has been upgrading the settlement and constructing safe housing since 2016. Unfortunately, due to hazardous conditions, he says they have only managed to build 400 homes out of the 6,000 needed.“We have had a big problem of actually re-engineering the complete spatial arrangement of our cities and improving the public infrastructure, not just for the wealthy, but also for those people who are on the lower end of the economic scale,” he said. “I have to make sure that I understand the terrible conditions that people live under and how can I contribute something to change their lives and do it quickly.”Mpahlwa’s approach to the design has been an inclusive one. The community he is building at the new Kosovo settlement has a mix of double and single-story homes to accommodate as many people as possible and make them accessible to those with disabilities.While anticipating the new settlement, residents use another one of Mpahlwa’s building projects, iThemba Labantu Lutheran Community Center, which includes multipurpose facilities and a soup kitchen serving as a crucial support system for the community.Amid delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic and zoning disputes, Mpahlwa is hopeful the project will progress.“It’s a new community which is developing here,” said the architect. “We’ve just got to make it work and be patient.”For now, Mpahlwa is focused on making housing equitable for everyone.“That’s what designed for social change means – that you afford even ordinary people the best quality of life possible.”",5973,https://www.cnn.com/style/luyanda-mpahlwa-architect-south-africa-spc/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231129131054-african-voices-luyanda-mpahlwa-2.jpg?c=original&q=h_618,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make technique mma systemic accuse replace begin back movement country technical apartheid spent build african ideology segregation crucial infamous team racism heavy cape indaba infrastructure safe emerge impoverish refuse drawing dangerous spending labor understand network nation housing robben education reference amnesty love appreciation unfortunately formerly majority transform drive human excellence grow base prison social put manage township low accommodate electricity timber group pandemic forward aesthetic hopeful blueprint urban scale earn hut serve wealthy young possible inclusion environment living define week shack mthatha give material battle director design add public award sewer lutheran dilapidate place economic town mandela relocate height evidence soup center school ordinary shape city permit university attempt champion support house develop full facility settlement ithemba experience focus firsthand firm condition luyanda upgrade alleviate emergency degree move reduce sandbag source big corobrik site institute plain energy impact power access building architecture draw complete home arrest trial mitchell treason inclusive resident day study mix architect necessarily include quality community slate approach founder pursuit realize struggle area reality found rain iteration catalyst abuse western roadblock indigenous black mpahlwa opportunity show embassy afford due recently dispute nelson boy force master construct cnn double africa arrangement work water stone delay incorporate contribute space tackle germany effort early change south call year accompany curry informal accessible multipurpose press beginning kosovo terrible lack hazardous kitchen problem labantu philippi release case artwork island german spatial state mother situation system conserve equitable zone update live cost exile reflect academic department berlin despite improve consciousness explain derail family held represent employ project basic desperate highlight anticipate eastern start create developed life,-0.0370499999999999,0.1506780512305374,10.658010849909584,0.3787945904224974,0,2023-12-01
CNN,Chinese hot pot chain Haidilao puts viral dance on menu,2023-11-30 23:34:00,Chris Lau,"What is better than a warming meal of hot pot? A catchy dance routine to go with the Chinese cuisine, according to hot pot chain Haidilao.Haidilao, China’s largest hot pot chain, has recently offered a new dance performance as part of the dining experience across its 1,400 branches.The chain – known for popularizing the Chinese eating culture where diners enjoy fresh ingredients by scalding them in a variety of soup bases – also has more than 100 stores across the world, including 13 branches in the US.Videos of staff springing into the “kemusan” - or “subject number three” dance - while guests eat has become the latest internet sensation on Chinese social media.The routine is widely believed to originate from a wedding dance in the southern Chinese region of Guangxi.The dance involves performers swinging their knees sideways as they perform a snappy series of hand actions, including rapid-fire wrist-twisting moves.The mesmerizing dance is done to music that sounds like a mix of Western disco beats and traditional Chinese folk singing.To “unlock” the new service, diners have to utter the code word “kemusan” to the servers, according to anecdotes posted online.The dance has become an instant sensation. In videos posted on social media, some diners seem to enjoy it so much that they join staff in the performance.“Kemusan” isn’t Haidilao’s first viral hit— the chain’s signature noodle dance became an instant classic around a decade ago. That dance involves stretching dough into noodle ribbons while gracefully twirling the long strands around with grand sweeping motions.Not everyone finds the Haidilao dancing cute. The act has started a debate online, with some calling it a “low” promotional tactic.It all started with a comment on a local Chinese online forum.A mother complained that she was annoyed by the “tacky squirming dance” following a recent meal with her family at one of the branches, according to Jimu News, a state-affiliated news outlet.Her comment quickly spiraled into a fierce debate online, topping the search terms on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Monday. Since then, the thread has been viewed more than 10 million times.One online influencer, with 740,000 followers, called the dance “exploitation.”“The staff no longer show any emotions, looking very stiff after performing kemusan. That’s too much effort,” he wrote on Weibo.A spokesman from Haidilao told CNN that the company has been encouraging branches to innovate and financially reward staff for their hard work.“The company will also provide corresponding incentives for employees who can gain customer recognition,” Haidilao said, though it stopped short of responding to online criticism.The company did not comment on reports that some branches have stopped offering the dance in the wake of the recent debate.Since opening in 1994, Haidilao has become known for its unconventional approach to attracting customers.Staff members in colorful masks sometimes perform traditional Chinese opera in front of diners, even in branches in the US and Britain.The chain also offers free drinks refills and snacks, and complimentary manicures, shoe shines and fruit plates for diners waiting to be seated.And since hot pot is considered a communal experience, the restaurants sometimes offer plush toys as companions for solo diners.",3340,https://www.cnn.com/travel/china-haidilao-viral-dance-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231201122258-subject-three-dance-china.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,widely incentive strand staff culture hot told cute employee word comment sound recent catchy manicure news write internet action plate consider diner toy offering base code annoyed social front low variety fresh emotion refill opera colorful fierce complain act wait spokesman southern chain member region customer noodle complimentary haidilao viral stiff attract stop monday swing involves sideways service soup popularize wedding mask sweep recognition gracefully originate restaurant believe performance provide unlock search quickly spiral experience video longer eat promotional kemusan view hand dough mesmerize million server folk meal encourage company snappy influencer companion find chinese local store financially mix include term approach drink platform dance classic ago scald ingredient subject free number thread cuisine unconventional decade plush western shine series show ribbon recently tacky performer shoe snack china cnn wake sensation accord signature world report innovate squirm effort call late opening hard long twirl top respond communal music follow debate weibo stretch jimu branch disco correspond follower perform spring large join beat mother short medium part enjoy grand solo instant knee traditional utter post online reward guest family offer routine fruit anecdote start warm,0.99055,0.0,12.190427350427347,0.3934038662486939,0,2023-11-30
MSNBC,The women of 'The Golden Bachelor' are everything. He's just Gerry.,2023-11-30 22:37:00,Emma Gray,"UPDATE (Dec. 1, 2023 10:00 a.m. E.T.): This piece has been updated to reflect Turner's choice on Thursday. He proposed to Theresa Nist. There’s a moment from the first season of “The Golden Bachelor” that I can’t get out of my head. In episode five, 72-year-old “Bachelor” Gerry Turner must cull the group of women vying for his heart from six to three. He stands in front of them, eyes welling with tears, and ultimately gifts the final rose of the night to the petite, 70-year-old brunette Theresa Nist. It’s the reaction of Leslie Fhima, however, the 64-year-old former professional dancer who will also vie for Turner’s heart in Thursday night’s season finale, that stuck with me. When Fhima realizes that her friend Ellen Goltzer is being eliminated, she slides closer to Ellen and gently leans her head on the other woman’s shoulder. The camera immediately pans away, following Nist as she weepily accepts Turner’s rose, but it’s that moment of tenderness between Fhima and Goltzer that burrowed its way into my heart. It’s the reaction of Leslie Fhima, however, the 64-year-old former professional dancer who will also vie for Turner’s heart in Thursday night’s season finale, that stuck with me. Anyone who watches reality television is familiar with the trope that cast members on competition shows — even if that competition is for love — “aren’t there to make friends.” But the women of “The Golden Bachelor” seemed there for love and friendship. And those of us who tuned in week after week were there to watch them search — for companionship, for friendship, for the right to be seen and heard and valued — whether or not they ended up with Turner, a man whose on-screen persona can best be described as an AI-generated, Sensitive Midwesterner Ken doll. Watching “The Golden Bachelor” has been an experience rife with joy. Where past seasons of “The Bachelor” have leaned into conflict and reduced the women to unflattering, flattening tropes, “Golden” flips the script and embraces complexity. The most heated the drama gets is when Kathy Swarts tells Nist to “zip it” when the latter overshares the lovey-dovey details of her burgeoning romance with Turner. But moments of platonic connection are frequent and dynamic: Susan Noles holds Goltzer as she cries during a group date at an amusement park. Goltzer, Fhima, Nist and Noles sing “Hava Nagila” and do the hora in the show’s sprawling mansion pool. Swarts, Noles, Nancy Hulkower, Faith Martin, Sandra Mason and April Kirkwood play a raucous game of “Never Have I Ever” with pints of ice cream instead of red solo cups full of liquor. When Joan Vassos has to leave the show early to help a daughter struggling with postpartum depression, the other women are devastated on her behalf. During the reunion episode, where rejected cast members come back together ahead of the finale, it was apparent that this cast was united by a shared sense of purpose; a feeling that they were all engaged in an important, collective process. Swarts said that in her mind the show is, yes, “about love. But it’s also about hope and friendship and what life offers all of us.” For journalist and author Lisa Belkin, “The Golden Bachelor” is captivating precisely because it allows moments of human connection that have nothing to do with the romantic lead to shine through. It’s a show about “how real people process love, grief, intimacy, uncertainty, rejection,” Belkin told me. “And one [element of that] is friendship.” I don’t want to overstate the subversiveness of “The Golden Bachelor.” It is still, at its core, a conservative, hetero, marriage show. And Turner, according to a recent Hollywood Reporter piece, is not such a folksy saint. But what makes “Golden” different from its predecessors in the franchise is that it is telling stories that are genuinely underrepresented. I am struck by how radical it feels to simply watch women over the age of 60 every week on my television screen; to see them portrayed as worthy of our attention, appreciation and investment. And my personal feelings are backed up by data: A report from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, which reviewed the most popular TV shows and films from 2010-2020, found that just 1 in 4 characters over the age of 50 were women. I am struck by how radical it feels to simply watch women over the age of 60 every week on my television screen. In her 1997 essay about the gendered double standard of aging, Susan Sontag describes the experience of growing older as “mainly an ordeal of the imagination” — a socially constructed state of being that “afflicts women much more than men.” For women, the experience of aging is in many ways divorced from the physical conditions of being “old.” Because the culture demands women over the age of 20 exist in a constant state of impossible youth maintenance, a looming dread of inevitable loss becomes imprinted upon our psyches and stays with us for decades. As a 36-year-old woman, arguably on the precipice of middle age, my peers and I have already spent years battling societal forces that, as Sontag put it, position women as “objects whose value depreciates rapidly with the march of the calendar.” If indeed the double standard women face is first and foremost an issue of a stilted cultural imagination, perhaps “The Golden Bachelor” can, in some small way, push the boundaries of how we imagine ourselves as we age. Instead of slowly fading into obscurity, the women of “The Golden Bachelor” demand that we look at them and consider them. That we understand their pains and desires and hopes. After all, they’re everything. He’s just Gerry.

CNN,The secret history of Japan’s best sweets,2023-11-30 20:39:00,Lilit Marcus,"There is a legend that a group of Portuguese monks were sailing to Macao when their ship hit bad weather and they landed in Nagasaki, Japan, instead.That accidental encounter ended up changing Japan – and its food – forever. One thing these monks, and the many Portuguese who would come after them, brought to the country was a simple, powerful and much-loved ingredient – sugar.During the 16th century, Nagasaki, on the island of Kyushu, was the only city through which foreigners could trade with the Japanese. As a result, it developed the strongest sweet tooth.Many of Japan’s present-day favorite wagashi – sweets – have their origins on Kyushu.One of these is castella, a Portuguese-inspired pound cake. Though the style of making pound cake came via Portugal, one ingredient makes it specifically Japanese: mizuame syrup, which is made from glutinous rice.The best place to snag some for yourself is at Fukusaya. It’s a well-known cake shop chain, with the first location opening – where else? – in Nagasaki in 1624. In Fukuoka, the largest city on the island of Kyushu, Fukusaya’s main branch is in the busy Akasaka neighborhood, not far from where tourists spill into the city from Hakata Station, western terminus of the Shinkansen high-speed train line.The castella here are cut into cubes, individually wrapped in colorful packaging and placed into gift boxes.Though there are occasional special flavors like sakura (cherry blossom) in the spring or chocolate around Christmas, it’s the classic castella that still sells the most, according to an Akasaka employee.Castella (kasutera in Japanese) also makes an appearance in another popular Japanese sweet, dorayaki. Here, the castella cake is thinner and made into a pancake with a layer of sweet red bean paste inside.Another European sweet that got the Japanese treatment is macarons.The local version, which is sometimes anglicized as makaron, is made with peanut flour instead of almond flour, and usually include traditional Japanese flavors like green tea or red bean.“I think the Japanese really like European pastries, especially French ones,” says Michele Abbatemarco, Est restaurant’s pastry chef at the Four Seasons Tokyo at Otemachi.And that appreciation works both ways.“In the last 50 years, there’s been a big evolution of pastries here in Japan. And then, there are quite a few patisseries in Europe and all over the world that are, in turn, inspired by Japanese products,” he adds.A Kyushu brand famed for its Europe-crossed-with-Japan sweets is Kitajima, whose flagship shop is in Saga City.Be on the lookout for Portugese-inspired marubolo cookies made with honey, French-style madeleines with walnuts added for texture, and Margaret cakes, made with almond flour and made to look like a big flower.One of Japan’s most popular and easily recognizable candies are konpeito. These small, pastel-hued sugar treats look like crystalline stars or flowers. The name is said to come from the Portuguese word for a type of sugar candy called confeito, which was brought to Japan by sugar merchants.Their size isn’t just about making the candies more “cute,” though – sugar was so expensive that even a small treat was extremely precious.Expensive ingredients have connections to rich and powerful people. In Japan, there’s no more powerful clan than the Imperial Family, headed by the Emperor and Empress.It’s a tradition for guests of the Imperial family – such as heads of state and other royals – to receive sterling silver candy boxes called bonbonnieres (French for “candy box”) as welcome gifts when they attend important events like weddings or the “feast ceremony” when a new emperor is crowned.These bonbonnieres are specially made by Tokyo silversmith company Miyamoto Shoko, and they’re decorated with a chrysanthemum, the royal family’s emblem. Inside, the lucky recipients – who have recently included the kings and queens of Spain, the Netherlands, and England – will find konpeito.These days, though, some chefs in Japan are trying to resurrect the local products that were used before the importation of sugar.Abbatemarco is one of them. During the decade-plus that he has been based in Japan, he has been able to source some of the rare honeys that were used to sweeten foods before the arrival of sugar.At Est, the Four Seasons’ Michelin-starred French restaurant, Abbatemarco and his team serve petits fours flavored with buckwheat honey, soba honey, wasanbon (a fine-grained white sugar) and other hard-to-find local delicacies.For him, it’s a way of honoring Japan’s small producers, in addition to introducing these flavors to the hotel’s guests.These days, foreign travelers are more likely to arrive in Japan via an airplane than by a sailing ship. But many of them still have sweet tooths.",4787,https://www.cnn.com/travel/japan-kyushu-sugar-road-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220830172056-lilit-marcus-byline-2022.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make kitajima decorate bean inspire honor busy spill packaging flower crystalline country recognizable tokyo occasional connection silversmith weather europe cute station word special team arrival blossom popular syrup lookout sugar pastry flour layer tooth walnut appreciation importation famed wasanbon sell century base head especially macao glutinous group colorful margaret treatment strong abbatemarco resurrect emblem star serve chain confeito european version land nagasaki christmas add trade cut place lucky welcome shoko wedding recipient petits foreigner portuguese foreign paste attend restaurant konpeito city rare easily peanut tea sterling legend japanese chocolate cube england monk patisserie king style receive source big company akasaka instead wagashi sakura buckwheat accidental snag arrive event netherlands powerful local find cake rich day kyushu include soba red introduce castella hakata forever producer kasutera classic gift ceremony saga ingredient simple texture food michele emperor airplane encounter western specifically recently white cooky addition shinkansen appearance makaron royal traveler candy small work brand accord portugal honey extremely inside size world almond imperial flagship ship expensive pound train individually terminus brought fukuoka change important call feast favorite location opening year chrysanthemum mizuame chef marubolo japan tradition queen bonbonnieres treat branch season specially shop spring miyamoto large type island cherry green state wrap madeleines box origin sweeten anglicize flavor traditional hit fukusaya dorayaki sail clan pancake sweet guest family thinner spain turn product silver evolution result developed tourist french neighborhood,0.99225,0.0,10.453966101694911,0.4133277216610548,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Daryl Hall accuses John Oates of ‘ultimate partnership betrayal’ in new legal filings,2023-11-30 18:51:00,Alli Rosenbloom,"Famed pop-rock duo Daryl Hall and John Oates of Hall & Oates are in the midst of a legal battle, and new accusations are coming to light.In new legal documents filed on Wednesday and obtained by CNN, Hall accuses Oates of engaging in “the ultimate partnership betrayal” when he “surreptitiously sought to sell” half of Whole Oats Enterprises LLP’s assets without seeking Hall’s approval.Whole Oats Enterprises LLP holds rights to Hall & Oates’ trademarks, personal name and likenesses, royalty income and certain social media and related website assets, according to the filing.Hall claims in a declaration filed Wednesday that Oates “falsely” contended his desire to maintain ownership in Whole Oats Enterprises LLP.As a result, Hall claims the “bad faith conduct” by Oates has created “tremendous upheaval, harm, and difficulty in my life, not to mention unnecessary expense and burden,” according to Hall’s declaration.Oates also filed a responsive declaration on Wednesday, in which he claims Hall’s accusations “are not true,” according to a copy of the filing also obtained by CNN.Last week, Hall filed a temporary restraining order (TRO) against Oates in Nashville’s chancery court citing a “contract/debt” dispute, according to court records.CNN previously reported the court granted Hall’s motion for the TRO on Friday, but the case was sealed at the time leaving the nature of the allegations unknown until this week’s new legal filings.The two musicians have a decades-long history as the eponymous rock duo Hall & Oates. They first met in the 1960s in Philadelphia, and according to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, had 29 Top Forty hits from 1976 to 1990.They saw tremendous success in the early 1980s with hits like “Private Eyes” and “Maneater.”CNN’s Andy Rose contributed to this report.",1800,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/entertainment/hall-oates-betrayal-lawsuit/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150312101933-chris-boyette-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,file history difficulty court seal private daryl seek document oat partnership legal contend conduct filing betrayal ultimate restrain personal tro eponymous expense musician harm faith half responsive likeness midst order time copy previously desire famed nashville roll chancery dispute sell related nature motion cnn social fame wednesday engage sought accord surreptitiously contribute report philadelphia maintain declaration rise website john llp early obtain falsely week top success rock battle grant tremendous andy hold upheaval mention case income royalty burden hall trademark medium unnecessary asset forty hit claim leave enterprise duo eye temporary allegation accusation ownership accuses result friday create life unknown oates,0.712,0.3333333333333333,9.998833819241977,0.4831056874160322,0,2023-11-30
MSNBC,Why Elon Musk’s ‘f--- yourself’ Dealbook moment wasn’t the worst part of the interview,2023-11-30 18:05:00,Elad Nehorai,"On Wednesday, Elon Musk added yet more fuel to the firestorm around his many antisemitic remarks, which have led advertisers to leave his social media site, X. At The New York Times’ annual DealBook Summit, he said: “If somebody’s gonna try to blackmail me with advertising? ... Go f--- yourself.” But in yet another example of how Musk’s bigotry has been able to go undetected for so long, his far more insidious comments were made just before his rant against advertisers. And while his “f--- you” was reported and shared on social media ad nauseam, very few focused on that particular part of the interview. Sorkin tried to move on instead of realizing what it was: Musk doubling down on antisemitism. During the sit-down, interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Musk about his post agreeing with an X user’s accusation that “Jewish communities” push “hatred against whites.” After ostensibly expressing regret for the post, which led to companies like Disney and Netflix pulling ads from X, Musk effectively reversed course. “Prominent people in the Jewish community,” he claimed, helped fund “demonstrations for Hamas in every major city in the West.” He added: “If you generically, without condition, fund persecuted groups … some of those persecuted groups, unfortunately, want your annihilation.” Unfortunately, Sorkin tried to move on instead of realizing what it was: Musk doubling down on antisemitism. In so doing, Sorkin displayed how so many in the media have failed in properly addressing Musk’s bigotry. Musk’s comments were essentially an attempt at a more “acceptable” version of saying that Jews are the funders behind the minority groups trying to destroy the Western world. This is, in fact, the Great Replacement conspiracy theory — the same one that he supposedly apologized for backing. Musk’s latest version is more qualified, and an attempt to be more specific, but it’s still a conspiracy theory based on the idea that Jews are manipulating world affairs in order to destroy white civilization. Musk has basically said some version of this conspiracy theory for more than a year now. For example, in September, he said George Soros was funding an “invasion” of immigrants into European countries. “The Soros organization” he wrote, “appears to want nothing less than the destruction of western civilization.” In fact, it is easy to find tweet after tweet after tweet after tweet by Musk spreading versions of this conspiracy theory. Musk only ended up facing real consequences for his behavior when he responded to a tweet that explicitly mentioned Jews. Worse, as both Islamophobia and antisemitism are skyrocketing in America, Musk used this moment to also spread Islamophobia by claiming that all protests against the war in Gaza support Hamas. The fact that this was all so easily overlooked highlights the danger of the moment. The richest man in the world, who owns a major social media company and has the power to guide the direction of wars, is spreading the same conspiracy theory that caused a man to commit a mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue — and other men to kill Black people in Buffalo, immigrants in El Paso and Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand. Yet, Musk only ended up facing real consequences for his behavior when he responded to a tweet that explicitly mentioned Jews. And now, when he confirmed his antisemitism on stage, livestreamed to millions of people, we see headlines like “Elon Musk apologizes for antisemitic tweet but tells advertisers ‘go f*** yourself’” and “Video: Elon Musk Apologizes for Endorsing Antisemitic Conspiracy Theory.” The vast majority of the interest has been on his expletives, instead of the very real danger he continues to represent to Jews, Muslims and so many others. At this point in this saga, there is no excuse for these mistakes. Elon Musk’s “apology” was a distraction that wasn’t worthy of a headline. Here’s what was: Elon Musk is an antisemite and an Islamophobe, and he is incredibly dangerous. It’s time we all treated him that way.

CNN,"Elliott Erwitt, photographer of America’s politicians, dogs and pop culture, dies at 95",2023-11-30 17:57:00,Jacqui Palumbo,"Elliott Erwitt, the photojournalist and filmmaker who wryly documented the minutiae of American life for over six decades, has died at 95.According to the caption accompanying a photo shared on his official Instagram account, Erwitt “passed away peacefully at home surrounded by family.”Erwitt was known for taking serendipitous black-and-white images captured on city streets, as well as pictures of public figures, including former US Presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, and celebrities Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe and Arnold Schwarzenegger.Erwitt’s humanistic approach to reportage landed him regular work for influential US magazines as well for international publications and tourism boards. He was a longtime member of the agency Magnum Photos, as well as its president for three years in the 1960s.“It is hard to measure the impact that Elliott Erwitt has had on Magnum and the world of photography,” the agency’s current president, Cristina de Middel, wrote in a remembrance shared Thursday. His images have helped build our general understanding of who we are as a society and as humans, and have inspired generations of photographers despite the changes in the industry and trends.”“The combination of his casual and humoristic approach to the act of photographing, and his obsessive dedication, made him a unique artist that we have lost today with great sadness,” de Middel added.Born Elio Romano Erwitz in Paris on July 26, 1928, Erwitt spent his early childhood in Milan. His family was of Russian-Jewish descent, and they left Europe for the US in 1939 just before World War II began. They settled in Los Angeles, where Erwitt eventually took studio photography classes at Los Angeles City College. He moved to New York City in 1948 and worked as a janitor at the New School for Social Research in exchange for enrollment into film courses there, according to Magnum Photos. In 1951, he was drafted into the US Army and took on photography duties while stationed in Europe. In Paris, he visited the Magnum Photos office and met Robert Capa, the renowned war photographer, who later invited him to join the group.Erwitt’s first major body of work, shot when he was 22 years old, wasn’t seen in full until 2018, through the exhibition “Elliott Erwitt: Pittsburgh 1950” at the International Center of Photography in New York. Erwitt took the photographs around the city of Pittsburgh, having been assigned by Roy Stryker, the former head of the US Farm Security Administration, whose commissions to photographers like Dorothea Lange and Gordon Parks resulted in some of the century’s most famous images.This assignment, from the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, intended to show the industrial city in a new, modern light through the eyes of a cohort of contemporary photographers. Erwitt took interest in human stories, particularly those of Pittsburgh’s children, but he and the other photographers working on the project delivered thousands of images in total, and many of Erwitt’s negatives weren’t used. They were instead kept in Stryker’s archive, unseen for decades.On his approach to photography, Erwitt has widely been quoted as saying, “It’s about reacting to what you see, hopefully without preconception. You can find pictures anywhere. It’s simply a matter of noticing things and organizing them. You just have to care about what’s around you and have a concern with humanity and the human comedy.”Over the course of his career, Erwitt keenly observed the closed-door events that shaped history, from the swanky fêtes of the social elite — like Truman Capote’s Black and White Ball at the Plaza Hotel in 1966 — to tense political moments on the world stage.One of Erwitt’s most famous images, from 1959, depicts then-US Vice President Richard Nixon jabbing a finger into the chest of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev while in Moscow at the opening of the American National Exhibition, a six-week diplomacy effort during the Cold War that introduced Russians to American mid-century art, design and appliances. The two leaders were engaged in an impromptu fiery argument that began over a model of an American kitchen (later dubbed the “Kitchen Debate”). Elliot was on a commercial assignment at the show, he later recounted in the book “Contact Sheet,” explaining: “I just happened to be in the right spot at the right time.”But many of his other most-celebrated pictures are lyrical or tongue-in-cheek photos of everyday life: a silhouetted image of a man leaping with an umbrella in front of the Eiffel Tower; a woman sitting on a New York City stoop with two bulldogs, angled so that the dog in her lap appears to have human limbs.Erwitt had a particular affinity for photographing dogs, in fact, releasing five books dedicated to the subject.“I take a lot of pictures of dogs because I like dogs, because they don’t object to being photographed, and because they don’t ask for prints,” he once offered as an explanation.Erwitt also made a number of documentary films, as well as 18 comedies for HBO in the 1980s and released monographs including 1965’s “Improbable Photographs” and 1989’s “Personal Exposures.” In 2015, the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas, acquired his photography collection spanning 1946-2010, which totals nearly 50,000 prints. A year later, the center opened the retrospective “Around the World” based on the collection.",5404,https://www.cnn.com/style/elliott-erwitt-photographer-dies-95/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231130174013-elliott-erwitt-05192011.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make board widely inspire cold print thursday austin truman marilyn begin matter document film tourism jabbing elite agency spent build simply official europe dietrich left picture enrollment administration station research paris account combination argument casual figure diplomacy capture contemporary improbable recount child understand write dubbed silhouette marlene college photograph fact khrushchev story react human class acquire century arnold observe base duty cohort head richard development modern middel park social reportage front exhibition stryker visit chest celebrity vice act open fiery dorothea sheet kennedy angle july eiffel member artist total exchange former lot land moscow office design particular monograph public photographer share depicts quote ball lose janitor center minutia pittsburgh intend elliot plaza tower current archive school dedication shape collection city major magazine texas retrospective capote premier instagram object roy light full renowned eventually sadness unseen famous bulldog angeles industry move york organize assign leap gordon history fêtes impact president instead milan conference event home tense descent find magnum humoristic great photo contact span personal include elio model robert lyrical community away army publication keenly notice approach introduce erwitt swanky measure cristina deliver book international ransom russian commission concern interest industrial number dedicate decade happen career black assignment show erwitz nikita studio white comedy street draft pass remembrance nixon photography thousand influential humanistic work accord engage world documentary political course woman body john art effort early change filmmaker society security settle impromptu opening accompany year elliott hard serendipitous commercial lange general caption debate photojournalist today kitchen longtime preconception stoop farm humanity negative harry national obsessive affinity release surround join regular capa monroe appliance unique spot invite shot leader umbrella finger allegheny american despite wryly image romano explain soviet eye childhood family offer particularly generation project hbo result moment life everyday peacefully,0.9613,0.0,9.973740157480318,0.3217126920698349,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Taylor Swift attends Beyoncé’s ‘Renaissance’ concert film premiere in London,2023-11-30 17:29:00,Alli Rosenbloom,"In the spirit of girl power and friendship – two things that will never go out of style – Taylor Swift was seen supporting Beyoncé at the London premiere of the latter’s “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé” concert film on Thursday.In videos posted to social media, Swift was seen walking into the premiere at London’s Leicester Square Theater abiding by the Beyoncé-mandated dress code in a glittering silver gown.The “Anti-Hero” singer’s show of support for Beyoncé is a familiar sight, after the “Break My Soul” singer attended Swift’s Los Angeles “Eras Tour” concert film premiere in October.“I’m so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce‘s influence. The way she’s taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms,” Swift wrote on her Instagram page the day after her premiere, showcasing a video of the pair flicking popcorn in the theater.Beyoncé first premiered her hotly anticipated “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé” concert film in Los Angeles on Saturday.The concert film was captured over the course of Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” world tour from this year, and “is about Beyoncé’s intention, hard work, involvement in every aspect of the production, her creative mind and purpose to create her legacy and master her craft,” according to an official synopsis.“Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé” will premiere in theaters on Friday.",1388,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/entertainment/taylor-swift-attends-beyonce-renaissance-premiere/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231130152310-01-taylor-swift-renaissance-film-premiere-1130.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,aspect flick legacy spirit power mind walk pair taught artist year hard premiere leicester film taylor abide latter popcorn friendship day square official sight beyoncé tour soul familiar singer page theater intention capture rule break involvement production medium showcasing attend defy write concert hotly swift influence premier glitter show instagram girl support beyonce norm post renaissance master code video creative social work accord purpose glad silver anticipate angeles industry friday create world style craft dress course life london,0.94955,0.4322766570605187,8.367259786476868,0.5046296296296295,0,2023-11-30
New York Times,"The Complex, Enduring Friendship of Shane MacGowan and Sinead O’Connor",2023-11-30 16:24:00,Amanda Hess,"Amanda Hess profiled Sinead O’Connor in 2021, and interviewed O’Connor’s friend and collaborator Shane MacGowan about their relationship.When I heard the news on Thursday that Shane MacGowan had died, I thought of Sinead O’Connor, his longtime friend and collaborator. I played their duet from 1995, “Haunted,” which MacGowan had originally written for the “Sid and Nancy” soundtrack. Then I watched their joint interview promoting the song for the Irish talk show “Kenny Live.”MacGowan appeared standoffish behind black sunglasses, a lit cigarette resting between his fingers. O’Connor was perched at his side in a big sweater, fiddling with her short hair and smiling slyly at her friend. The host, Pat Kenny, called the collaboration “strange and unlikely,” but they did not see it that way. “We’re different sexes, yeah,” MacGowan said, to which O’Connor replied: “Are we?”O’Connor died this summer, a few months before MacGowan did. When I profiled her in 2021, I interviewed them both. They spoke of each other warmly, but they needled each other, too. They seemed different in the way siblings are different — two musicians riffing on a shared context, picking up different threads of the same conversation.Both made music out of their troubled childhoods, mental illness and addiction. Both helped popularize Irish music around the world, even as they maintained a critical distance from their own stardom. In interviews, they were funny and blunt. Their public reception, however, was different. In our interview, O’Connor identified a double standard. “When men are drunk and on drugs — for example, Shane MacGowan of the Pogues — people idolize them,” she said. “A man could be like that, but a woman couldn’t.”AdvertisementTheir relationship was complex. In a 2021 biography of MacGowan, O’Connor recalled performing a version of “Haunted” with him while he was using heroin. “The producers were freaking out because Shane was nodding out on smack in between the verses,” she told MacGowan’s biographer, Richard Balls. “I was singing my verse and they didn’t believe he was going to wake up and neither did I.” In 1999, a few years after that collaboration, O’Connor called the police on MacGowan when she found him using heroin at his home.They fell out over it, then grew back together. Later, when asked if O’Connor’s police call ended his relationship with her, he replied, “No, but it ended my relationship with heroin.” In 2004, when O’Connor gave birth to a baby boy, she named him Shane. And at MacGowan’s 60th birthday party, in 2018, she performed the song “You’re The One,” which MacGowan originally sang with Moya Brennan.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Amanda Hess is a critic at large for the New York Times.

Washington Post,"Elliott Erwitt, photographer who transformed mundane into art, dies at 95",2023-11-30 16:16:00,not specified,"Elliott Erwitt, a renowned photojournalist and commercial photographer who captured mundane, sometimes fleeting scenes of life and transformed them into humorous, enthralling or disturbingly evocative moments for all time, died Nov. 29 at his home in Manhattan. He was 95.The death was announced by Magnum Photos, where Mr. Erwitt had a more than six-decade affiliation including three years as the agency’s president in the 1960s.In a body of work spanning seven decades, Mr. Erwitt proved a master of what his mentor Henri Cartier-Bresson called seizing the “the decisive moment” — being trigger-quick to observe the extraordinary in the ordinary and turn it into compelling art.Mr. Erwitt, who remained a proponent of black-and-white film well into the age of digital photography, had dual careers as a journalist and an artist. He began contributing in the 1950s to Magnum, the prestigious photojournalism agency founded by Cartier-Bresson and another mentor, Robert Capa, as well as to popular magazines of the day, such as Life, Newsweek, Collier’s and Look.On his photo shoots, Mr. Erwitt carried two cameras, one for his assignment and one for his pleasure. He insisted that his paid professional work — which he termed “creative obedience” — was merely a means to support his avocation. Among his acquired photographic enthusiasms was a fascination with dogs, which he showed in comically improbable settings. One is in the driver’s seat of a Renault, on a Paris street, glancing insouciantly toward the photographer.“Elliott has to my mind achieved a miracle,” Cartier-Bresson told the Guardian newspaper in 2003, “working on a chain gang of commercial campaigns and still offering a bouquet of stolen photos with a flavor, a smile from his deeper self.”Mr. Erwitt embraced his personal photography with unremitting passion. He wandered the streets of capital cities and distressed communities around the world, pausing to snap a few images of any scene that caught his instinctive eye: a small French boy in a beretsitting on a bicycle, between his father and two baguettes, grinning at the photographer; a young woman, her back to the camera, gazing at the Empire State Building as it emerges from the fog; an African American child smiling and holding a toy gun to his head in 1950 Pittsburgh.“What draws us in is that you can go back to an Elliott Erwitt picture again and again and always find another layer,” said Mark Lubell, executive director of the International Center of Photography in New York. “What makes us connect is the humanity in those pictures.”His journalism and commercial work led to encounters with celebrities including Frank Sinatra, Muhammad Ali and Simone de Beauvoir. Mr. Erwitt held out for the intimacy and immediacy he found in their less-guarded moments. A 1956 photo of Marilyn Monroe shows her not as a cartoonish sex goddess or doomed victim, but rather as a thoughtful actress poring over a script with an enigmatic smile.His 1964 portraits of Cuban leader Fidel Castro and fellow revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara swaggering through Havana’s streets highlighted their charisma.“Fidel Castro was very photogenic, kind of a cowboy,” Mr. Erwitt later told the digital-media company 1854 Media. “An interesting person, obviously, and very chatty. It was extraordinary to get them in the same room. Che was at the time busy trying to get other countries to follow the Cuban example. They were quite willing to be photographed, it was quite easy. It’s a lot easier to photograph stars than not.”Armed with his Rolleiflex 4x5 portrait camera, along with his versatile Leica Rangefinder, Mr. Erwitt bore witness to some of the mid- and late 20th century’s defining moments.He took several notable pictures of pre-civil-rights-era America, including one of a young Black man, in North Carolina, drinking from a dingy water fountain next to a sparking fountain for Whites.In 1957, he was in the Soviet Union to photograph the launch of Sputnik and was the only Western photographer to capture the 40th anniversary of the Russian Revolution in Moscow. He was an accredited photographer in President John F. Kennedy’s White House, and he took a stark portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy at her husband’s funeral in 1963, her face an image of grief.A few years earlier, he had photographed Vice President Richard M. Nixon jabbing his finger into the burly chest of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at a 1959 American industrial exhibition in Moscow. The encounter came to be known as the “Kitchen Debate,” and the next year — much to Mr. Erwitt’s chagrin — Nixon used the photo in his failed presidential campaign to illustrate his tough stance on communism.For all his travels, one of Mr. Erwitt’s most celebrated photos was taken at home: a grainy 1953 image, shot with little more than window light, of his wife, Lucienne, watching with adoration their sleeping 6-day-old baby, Ellen, on their bed.The photo, which Mr. Erwitt saw as just “a family picture of my first child, my first wife and my cat,” was included in Edward Steichen’s best-selling “Family of Man” book in 1954 and the photography exhibition the next year at the Museum of Modern Art. Among Mr. Erwitt’s best-selling prints, it “put several of my kids through college,” he later told an interviewer. (He won the International Center of Photography’s lifetime achievement award, among other honors.)Mr. Erwitt at times spoke critically about the pretension and artifice he observed in fashion and art photography. Known for his puckish sense of humor, he made his point by creating an alter ego, a self-important French photographer, Andre S. Solidor, whose initials make an intended pun. Under that name, he published a book with gratuitous nudity and pointless imagery (including a fish head smoking a cigar).In his work, Mr. Erwitt often defied prevailing ideas in photography. He cared little about sharp focus, composition and the image-enhancing effects available in the darkroom. To the untrained eye, many of his photographs — flat, grainy, uncropped — may appear to be the products of hurried execution.“There’s an incredible vitality to his pictures,” said Alison Nordstrom, a photography historian and curator. “Some of those flaws — being out of focus, chopping someone’s head off — really contribute to that sense of being alive and in the moment.”Mr. Erwitt published his final book, “Found, Not Lost,” in 2021, at age 93.Elio Romano Erwitz was born in Paris on July 26, 1928, to Russian Jewish immigrant parents. His father was an architect, and his mother came from a family of wealthy merchants in Moscow. They lived in Milan before fleeing Benito Mussolini’s anti-Semitic racial laws in 1938 and arrived in New York at the start of World War II. Elio was soon renamed Elliott Erwitt.After his parents divorced in 1941, he moved to Los Angeles with his father, who by then was selling watches. Mr. Erwitt got his first camera while at Hollywood High School and wandered the neighborhood snapping photos during the war years.When Elliot was 15, he later told the Financial Times, his father abandoned him. “I was on my own and had to fend for myself,” he said. But he professed not to harbor bitterness toward his father, whom he described as a “wonderful man” and who later ventured into photography. “He said he wanted ‘to follow in the footsteps of his son,’ ” Mr. Erwitt recalled.While in high school, he earned money by photographing weddings. He studied photography formally at Los Angeles City College. In 1948, Mr. Erwitt moved back to New York and took photography and filmmaking classes at what is now the New School for Social Research. A polyglot who spoke four languages, he visited Europe in 1949 to hone his craft. When he returned to the United States, he was hired by photographer Roy Stryker for Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey to help document the revitalization of Pittsburgh.Mr. Erwitt’s work in the Steel City spawned his first serious photo essay, but, before he could finish the project, he was drafted into the Army Signal Corps during the Korean War and served in France and Germany as a photographer.In 1953, he was recruited by Capa to Magnum Photos. That same year, he married Lucienne Van Kan. That marriage and later marriages to Diana Nugent, Susan Ringo and Pia Frankenberg ended in divorce.Mr. Erwitt had four children from his first marriage, Ellen, Misha, David and Jennifer, all surnamed Erwitt; two children from his third marriage, Sasha and Amelia; 10 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Four of his children were either photographers or work in the photography business in some other capacity.Mr. Erwitt’s affiliation with Magnum brought a steady flow of assignments, but he also ventured into more lucrative advertising photography. As a commercial photographer, he often worked on movie sets. He was one of several photographers who captured Monroe’s subway grate updraft scene from “The Seven Year Itch” (1955).Five years later, on the set of “The Misfits,” Mr. Erwitt shot Monroe as she struggled with depression and drug addiction while her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller unraveled. Monroe’s face, in the Erwitt photos, shows her deepening sadness.Mr. Erwitt said he favored life’s comic moments over the darkly dramatic ones. He made a documentary film, “Beauty Knows No Pain” (1972), that takes a sardonic look at a majorette drill team in Texas. With a dry, ironic wit, he also compiled eight books of canine photos, with names such as “Son of Bitch” (1974, with an introduction by P.G. Wodehouse), “Dog Dogs” (1998) and “Woof” (2005).",9615,https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/11/30/elliott-erwitt-photographer-dies/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,grin point leader company international improbable effect intimacy contribute tough critically harbor social lubell wealthy draft grandchild draw union photograph announce print sasha prevail revolution nordstrom movie spark hurry diana illustrate capa jacqueline back digital offering medium milan celebrity smile incredible seat master john witness turn eye observe cowboy stance smoking north late guardian serve amelia photographic remain russian kitchen gratuitous time steal focus craft polyglot mentor chatty depression revolutionary empire marriage mind passion call community executive agency newspaper city move humorous light gang monroe enigmatic playwright camera andre sell easy enthral lose edward available pause essay ernesto artist actress journalism glance venture found comically intend newsweek accredit formally scene artifice texas father unremitting mussolini fish dry doom interviewer ironic arm neighborhood bitch instinctive interest award brought creative adoration updraft victim grainy parent transform proponent canine book addiction wit romano campaign york puckish connect sputnik begin soviet evocative ego popular thoughtful span merchant house art building manhattan frank director travel told mark standard fountain research historian commercial bitterness advertising exhibition watch dingy business collier child live flow flee composition moscow wonderful wander room castro fail flat disturbingly grate visit lucrative head marilyn return pleasure nudity untrained arthur follow filmmaking susan setting decade wedding spawn cuban elio career architect earlier white fidel imagery century body alive david prove surnamed unraveled professional snap distressed photogenic lifetime fend korean support chain swagger notable pretension script fleeting beretsitting defy america achievement image nugent project sex moment shot shoot beauvoir busy hire capital rolleiflex finish revitalization united final american chest drill vice elliott center make caught year arrive industrial dual gaze rename include emerges small alter museum photography portrait water acquire drinking europe spoke mr picture steichen obedience western kennedy team erwitt woman gun nixon erwitz elliot insist home seize jennifer assignment leica find highlight beauty sardonic start baby paid hollywood roy compile define family angeles footstep jabbing celebrate personal flavor french married richard fog chop corp immediacy encounter photojournalism benito mundane subway extraordinary majorette signal street carolina immigrant set pain document compelling humor idea funeral steady photo achieve henri abandon jewish initial renault paris stryker fashion money bicycle wodehouse toy class high racial profess husband flaw oil uncropped army frankenberg lucienne fascination cigar robert vitality versatile woof fellow photojournalist earn launch country insouciantly school state simone renowned curator debate documentary humanity modern president chagrin kind magazine goddess person comic african struggle work age life misfit introduction alison cartoonish stark guevara nikita layer kid decisive film embrace hold pia carry pore affiliation born darkly recruit itch darkroom young put ringo death havana france magnum boy bouquet july bore world financial publish sinatra language product lead journalist khrushchev driver show burly law black ordinary pointless germany lot prestigious described sharp mother baguette term anniversary finger held favor enthusiasm muhammad star capture deepen wife steel college rangefinder divorce dramatic misha deeper day sleep photographer create study avocation jersey miracle premier window miller solidor presidential,0.98015,0.0624024960998439,8.889870689655172,0.3661748251748252,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Tim Burton says ‘Beetlejuice 2’ has officially wrapped production,2023-11-30 15:59:00,Alli Rosenbloom,"The long-awaited sequel to 1988’s “Beetlejuice” has finished production, bringing us one step closer to seeing Michael Keaton’s gleefully grotesque “ghost with the most” grace our screens once again.Tim Burton, the visionary director behind the original classic as well as the sequel, shared the production update on his Instagram page Thursday.“Just finished shooting Beetlejuice. Thank you to everyone involved,” he wrote in the caption, alongside a photo of himself relaxing on set.Burton is seen holding a long numbered ticket in the photo, and the set in which he is seen sitting appeared similar to the iconic Neitherworld waiting room from the first movie.The new film will feature the return of original stars Keaton, Winona Ryder and Catherine O’Hara, as well as the addition of “Wednesday” star Jenna Ortega as Astrid Deetz, the daughter of Ryder’s character Lydia Deetz.Newcomers among the sequel’s cast include Monica Bellucci, Willem Dafoe and Justin Theroux. Dafoe told Variety earlier this week that he will play “a police officer in the afterlife.”“So I’m a dead person.

But because of my skills, I became a detective character in the afterlife,” Dafoe added.The 1988 movie starred Keaton as the fast-talking, highly inappropriate poltergeist who looks to take advantage of a “recently deceased” couple, as well as their former home’s wacky new tenants.It was a dark, funny and inventive original story that turned into a critical and bankable success, spawning cartoons as well as a recently-shuttered Broadway musical.Keaton shared in a June interview with Empire that he and Burton both agreed the sequel would have “to be done as close to the way we made it the first time,” adding that working on “Beetlejuice 2” is “the most fun” he’s had working on a film in a while.“Beetlejuice 2” is set to premiere in theaters in September 2024.CNN’s Dan Heching contributed to this report.",2006,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/entertainment/tim-burton-beetlejuice-2-wrapped-production/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bring story screen michael classic jenna couple astrid contribute grace skill shoot advantage bellucci finish deetz beetlejuice movie make bankable similar wait visionary neitherworld feature iconic character winona dead inappropriate detective person turn funny include fun monica cartoon original june work numbered close step life recently add ortega wacky ghost poltergeist theater director told broadway burton ticket willem film catherine hold police closer time instagram justin agree update production home afterlife cast interview officer former theroux dark room empire relax alongside keaton long grotesque involve page accident variety addition side share daughter gleefully return report play spawn caption dafoe highly success premiere critical sequel earlier week star set ryder september decease photo action inventive write heching wednesday lydia,0.95575,0.1495513459621136,8.756868686868685,0.5019801462904911,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,"At the Shakespeare Theatre, ‘As You Like It’ meets the Beatles",2023-11-30 15:55:00,not specified,"Shakespeare and the Beatles? In theater director Daryl Cloran’s “As You Like It,” the two, pardon the pun, come together. He has incorporated about two dozen Fab Four standards into his staging of Shakespeare’s popular comedy, running at Shakespeare Theatre Company from Dec. 2 to 31.With actor-musicians performing the tunes live, this “As You Like It” has proved a hit since premiering in 2018 at Bard on the Beach festival in Vancouver. The production may not have been here, there and everywhere, but it has certainly traveled around Canada and to Chicago and Milwaukee. The Shakespeare/Beatles matchup is no mere gimmick, Cloran says, as the music and text truly align. When he started work on the production, he remembers, “it really felt, as I went through, that these songs were written for this play.”It helps that “As You Like It” is a comedy replete with singing, versifying characters. A tale of love and mix-ups in the Forest of Arden, the play depicts banished courtiers passing the time with hey-nonny-no ditties, while the loyal Orlando writes poems extolling his beloved Rosalind, who happens to be disguised as a man. The play is “so lyrical and poetic that there was lots of room to imagine how music can continue the story,” Cloran says.Speaking from Edmonton, Canada, where he is artistic director of the Citadel Theatre, the director says “As You Like It” originated as a follow-up to a jazz musical version of “Love’s Labor’s Lost” he staged for Bard on the Beach in 2015. That experiment worked out so well that Christopher Gaze, the founding artistic director of Bard on the Beach, proposed a Shakespeare production indebted to John, Paul, George and Ringo. “As You Like It” seemed the obvious choice.Cloran trimmed Shakespeare’s script to make room for the tunes and pored over the Beatles catalogue to figure out what song might fit where. Fully integrating the music was key. “We didn’t want to just make a jukebox musical where we pause Shakespeare’s play for a moment and listen to a lovely song and then carry on with the story,” he says. “We wanted the songs to continue to propel the story and the characters forward.”As an example of the “easy fits” he found for the music, he cites the moment in Act 2 when the moody courtier Jaques soliloquizes about meeting a “fool” in the forest. “It’s not hard to imagine that he then breaks into ‘The Fool on the Hill,’” Cloran says.When it came to choosing a setting for this “As You Like It,” the director took inspiration from its fight scene, in which Orlando vies with a wrestler named Charles. Cloran says he realized that, during the Beatles’s heyday in the 1960s, Vancouver had a burgeoning professional-wrestling scene. Grounding the storytelling in that decade was a no-brainer. He even devised a wrestling pre-show “to really set the world and set the tone,” he says.But the biggest wrestling challenge for this “As You Like It” is perhaps in the legal realm: The song rights need to be recleared each time the show is staged. And getting the rights to the Beatles is no stroll down Penny Lane. Gaze says it never occurred to him, when he proposed the production’s concept, that it might be easier said than done.“Ignorantly on my behalf, I thought, ‘We’ll just get the rights to the music,’” Gaze remembers. But that goal turned out to be “extremely complicated,” he says, crediting Bard on the Beach executive director Claire Sakaki with keeping “As You Like It” on its long and winding legal road.Consultant John Ciccone, a musician and copyright expert based in Toronto, handles music clearances for “As You Like It” and other Bard on the Beach shows through his company Copyright Music & Visuals. “I remember the first call I got from Claire Sakaki,” he says. “She called me and said, ‘Are we out of our minds to even ask you about getting the rights to use Beatles music?’”Ciccone answered that the task would be pricey and difficult, with many hoops to jump through, understandably, given that the Beatles “changed the face of popular culture forever.” But he added, “It’s not impossible. And if you have nerves of steel to put up with all of that, then try it.”As an example of that nerve-testing complexity, Ciccone says that for the Washington run he had to work with several entities, including major player Sony Music Publishing, Downtown Music Publishing (administering 50 percent of “Love Me Do,” he says), Universal Music Publishing Group (administering 50 percent of “I Want to Hold Your Hand” in the United States but 100 percent of it in Canada) and others.Keeping track of who controls song rights is an ongoing challenge in his line of work. “These things can be bought and sold like pork bellies on the stock market,” Ciccone says. Cloran remembers being astonished when the song rights cleared for the show’s 2018 premiere. “I think we got the rights out of sheer Canadian politeness,” he says.In the years since that permissions coup, “As You Like It” has romped across stages with different configurations of actors. The show recently had a return engagement at Bard on the Beach, and most of those performers are returning for the Shakespeare Theatre run. (This is not the first melding of the Bard and the Beatles at Shakespeare Theatre. In 2006 the company staged a version of “Love’s Labor’s Lost” centering on a Beatles-like rock group in 1960s India, minus the music.)Cloran attributes the success of “As You Like It” in large part to its ebullient spirit. “That’s the thing we’re so proud of,” he says. “It’s just a joyous night at the theater.”Shakespeare Theatre Company, Harman Hall, 610 F St. NW. 202-547-1122. shakespearetheatre.org.Dates: Dec. 2-31.",5671,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater/2023/11/30/shakespeare-theatre-as-you-like-it/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story script stage run company version hill catalogue listen fab complicate orlando canadian daryl milwaukee moment minus united beatles ongoing handle edmonton sheer make center heyday passing canada year realm clear act indebted moody visuals gaze john astonish part turn include meld wrestling behalf tone vancouver lovely ground recently credit change expert perform remembers permission hit christopher jump citadel incorporate musician spirit time goal configuration george lane propose ebullient matchup f rock stock imagine paul impossible start long big hand jazz continue ignorantly poem hoop mind ciccone call fully executive nw love music vies harman sony lose easy sell proud propel pause writes beloved pork labor dozen actor universal set wind task shakespeare meeting beach wrestler sing politeness jaques found romped bard administer copyright write comedy scene challenge market experiment break poetic banish nerve toronto charles text sakaki burgeon storytelling engagement night difficult percent integrate jukebox replete track inspiration gimmick depicts stag occur arden disguise artistic state character hard large originate downtown claire concept pardon washington extremely popular work base publishing forest add devise extol figure theatre cloran theater director travel choose standard realize felt attribute clearance performer festival complexity joyous hold recleared carry pore song give ringo production put coup live rosalind ditty chicago room versify remember world penny major obvious answer show musical different return pricey play courtier trim decade lot bought success premiere understandably player control legal line group fit steel fool entity loyal culture key prove lyrical fight belly soliloquizes stroll hall premier india align,0.996,0.0529007229765473,6.847355932203389,0.5334541062801933,1,2023-11-30

CNN,Judge dismisses Indiana state’s lawsuit against TikTok over child safety concerns,2023-11-30 15:44:00,Samantha Murphy Kelly,"A judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by the state of Indiana against TikTok accusing the company of making false claims about the safety of user data and age-appropriate content.Judge Jennifer DeGroote of Allen County Superior Court in Fort Wayne, Indiana, said the court “lacks personal jurisdiction” over TikTok and that downloading an app at no cost does not constitute a “consumer transaction” under the Indiana Deceptive Consumer Sales Act, according to court documents. The ruling was first reported by the Associated Press.The lawsuit, which was filed in December 2022 originally as two lawsuits and later consolidated, was the first serious action taken by a state against the social media platform. Similar lawsuits now remain active in other states including Arkansas and Utah.“The TikTok app is a malicious and menacing threat unleashed on unsuspecting Indiana consumers by a Chinese company that knows full well the harms it inflicts on users,” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a statement at the time. “With this pair of lawsuits, we hope to force TikTok to stop its false, deceptive, and misleading practices, which violate Indiana law.”TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The lawsuit alleged TikTok attracts young people to its platform under the pretense that it’s safe yet still exposes them to inappropriate content including drug and alcohol use, nudity and profanity. It also claimed the company collects sensitive data and personal information about consumers in Indiana and that the company, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, “has deceived those consumers to believe that this information is protected from the Chinese government and Communist Party.”Last month, Indiana joined dozens of states in a lawsuit against Instagram-parent Meta over concerns that its features are addictive and can harm young users’ mental health.The heightened attention around these issues follows the 2021 release of tens of thousands of internal company documents by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen that revealed the company knew its products could have negative impacts on young people’s mental health.Indiana was also one of the first states that ordered TikTok to be banned on government-issued devices, citing the threat of “gaining access to critical U.S. information and infrastructure.”- CNN’s Clare Duffy contributed to this report",2386,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/tech/indiana-tiktok-lawsuit-dismissed/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,consolidated heighten download lack rokita company month information collect threat lawsuit judge pretense inflicts data contribute social haugen practice cost stop december chinese make believe similar force act state todd feature medium safety attorney originally profanity degroote inappropriate order active include protect violate expose platform menace duffy constitute superior facebook government request deceptive statement whistleblower app bytedance alcohol dismiss remain file time young malicious france unsuspecting mislead attention tiktok general jennifer jurisdiction addictive cnn ban consumer accord unleashed communist court product personal release claimed pair sensitive giant ten access report impact nudity user wayne associate transaction follow claim mental allege indiana respond county fort knew critical dozen arkansas issue negative concern harm join thousand hope document content ruling safe internal accuse deceive action false attracts full device clare reveal meta immediately tech,-0.93725,0.5029337803855826,13.134088669950737,0.4159722222222222,0,2023-11-30

CNN,Remember when Fran Fine’s fashion broke the ’90s TV show mold?,2023-11-30 14:47:00,Marie Lodi,"(CNN) — The 1990s gave birth to many fictional style icons whose wardrobes inspire generation after generation. There’s “Clueless” fashion plates Cher Horowitz and Dionne Davenport, “Sex and the City”‘s Carrie Bradshaw, and “Friends”’s Rachel Green, to name a few. Still, not many have had the cultural impact of “The Nanny” herself, Fran Fine.With her leopard print mini dresses, neon skirt suits and rainbow vests, Fran (played by the incomparable Fran Drescher) was a colorful and feminine respite from the muted grunge fashions popular at the time the sitcom premiered in November 1993.During its six-season run, the flashy girl from Flushing won viewers’ hearts worldwide; 30 years later, her fanbase has only grown. Over the years, fan accounts like What Fran Wore and the Fran Fine Fashion Database have documented all of the character’s roughly 700 outfits. TikTok fashion lovers — many of whom had not been born when the show aired — frequently recreate her most iconic looks today, resulting in the hashtag #franfinefashion reaching over 35 million views. In other words, Fran Fine is quintessentially retro and always of the moment.As the show’s inaugural costume designer, Brenda Cooper was largely responsible for Fran’s signature style. She worked on “The Nanny” for the first four seasons, and in 1995 won an Emmy for her work on the show. (Costume designers Shawn Holly Cookson and Terry Gordon later took over after she left to have children.)Cooper dressed Drescher in designer wares from Versace, Todd Oldham, Dolce and Gabbana, Bob Mackie, and Anna Sui, among others.But it was the Italian label Moschino that provided many of Fran’s most kitschy and whimsical looks, such as her watermelon polka dot jacket (from the premiere episode), a pink newsprint pantsuit (season 1, episode 17), and dress whose skirt resembled piano keys (season 4, episode 23). “The thing that we loved about Moschino that seemed so perfect for this series is that it had pizzazz, but it also had humor,” recalled Drescher in a 2020 video for Vogue. “That was Brenda Cooper’s genius. We created a look that… was something that people responded to very favorably.”Among all of Fran’s most memorable looks, one specific piece by Moschino stands out: a red heart-shaped purse. Featured in an episode from the show’s third season, in which Fran goes on a date with a mobster, the bag was paired with a black Hervé Leger mini dress, an outfit that might be considered plain compared to her typical, more colorful looks. It may have only appeared the one time, but the bag has been seared into the memories of Fran fans ever since.“I was always looking for something that had style, something that had wit, and something that had a sense of humor,” Cooper told CNN. “I was walking through Neiman Marcus to the second floor, and I looked to my right and was like, O-M-G, that is perfect. She’s on a date, and she’s holding a heart purse — again, there’s the wit.”Moschino first released the bag in 1995, for about “$300 or $400,” Cooper recalled. The same bag can NOW be found on reseller sites for upwards of $6,000. (Cooper still has the original used in the scene.) Jennie Walker, an LA-based stylist and luxury vintage reseller who owns an extensive vintage Moschino collection, said the bag’s inflated price is in large part due to its cameo on the show. “There is such a frenzy around ‘The Nanny,’ and people who are fans of the show,” Walker told CNN. “All those (people) are specifically looking for that bag.”Nowadays, it’s easy to find bags reminiscent of Moschino’s famed design, with Kate Spade, Alaïa, Coach, Gucci, and Vivienne Westwood having made their own takes, as well as a slew of fast-fashion knockoffs.Cooper says that when she first envisaged Fran’s aesthetic, it didn’t reflect early ‘90s fashion trends. “Hunting for all of that color was a task,” she recalled. “But I had a vision.”To make things trickier, Cooper didn’t have much of a budget to work with, but now says this proved a blessing in disguise since it helped her land on Fran’s sartorial uniform: a black pencil skirt cut “as short as possible,” paired with a turtleneck, black opaque tights, and suede heels. This versatile canvas allowed Fran to re-wear the same basics over numerous episodes, styling and accessorizing them with bright blazers, colorful coats, and standout pieces.“There was a formula to it… it was turning something sophisticated into (something) sassy,” she added. In 2022, she wrote a book called “The Silhouette Solution: Using What You Have to Get the Look You Want,” inspired by the formula she used on the show.When designing for contemporary characters, costume designers often try to make their characters’ wardrobes look (and feel) timeless. Cooper accomplished that with “The Nanny,” proving there is a way to create an enduringly stylish wardrobe for “​​the lady in red when everybody else is wearing tan.”Though Fran wore a lot of designer clothing, her outfits are easy to replicate, no matter the budget. It’s no wonder that after all these years, fans of “The Nanny” and fashionable TikTokers continue to cosplay as Fran in swarms.And what better way to show love for a globally cherished character than a heart bag?",5229,https://www.cnn.com/style/the-nanny-fashion-fran-fine-moschino-remember-when/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,run generation episode tights gabbana mobster sex kate possible davenport print color reminiscent fran contemporary trickier marcus uniform make year matter todd alaïa viewer feature feel green result hashtag recreate ware accessorizing fanbase outfit part turn lady sassy piano site million mackie fictional upwards grown heel turtleneck silhouette wore time blazer fashionable walk due feminine today opaque fine style cultural extensive cnn versace find famed blessing stylish reflect shawn provide continue responsible moschino purse call franfinefashion city dionne wonder birth release love grunge pair inflate formula sear slew impact november polka easy reseller mute coach replicate cosplay stylist perfect terry wardrobe land italian timeless cameo globally task drescher vintage document humor gordon cooper flush pink found budget luxury price neon view write leopard respite collection emmy scene bob watermelon specific colorful canvas fashion left red date vivienne cut plain girl mini played sartorial spade versatile kitschy frenzy solution nowadays typical disguise iconic book database character lover inaugural wit gucci large piece genius series specifically early popular original season work cher wear flashy hervé add design sophisticated told horowitz pencil jacket hold roughly born recall largely dot give label child bradshaw signature trend skirt friend tiktok carrie rachel reach neiman envisage nanny worldwide whimsical consider hunt word aesthetic sitcom clueless show holly pantsuit account standout video black clothing accomplish inspire quintessentially lot memorable vest rainbow respond jennie cherished resemble premiere oldham brenda short westwood numerous suede basic compare leger tiktokers air dress pizzazz bright newsprint costume suit key heart incomparable anna prove frequently vogue designer bag walker create retro cookson plate enduringly coat premier stand floor icon dolce memory,0.99485,0.0,6.91348581884721,0.4572191697191696,0,2023-11-30

CNN,Opinion: What the critics missed about ‘The Golden Bachelor’,2023-11-30 14:44:00,not specified,"My grandmother used to have these jelly arms that I loved to play with. Her feathery, loose flesh was warm and soft and would jiggle back and forth when we pushed it as she hugged us, and we felt loved.There were grandmothers on “The Golden Bachelor,” but none of them reminded me of mine — or any stereotypical grandmother, as the show turned aging and getting older on its head.As the 28th season of the reality franchise comes to a close, and 72-year-old Gerry Turner — either a wholesome Midwestern widower or a chauvinistic cad, according to recent reports — picks his true love, many people will be devastated, because they’re either #teamTheresa or #teamLeslie.Not me. For me, the finale is beside the point. For me, it’s not about the rose ceremony, it’s about all the women who showed up to participate and what they tell us about our culture’s understanding of older women’s lives.To be fair, I haven’t been part of Bachelor Nation since a brief engagement during its origins in the early aughts; I was in my 30s and dating, hoping I might glean some wisdom about finding love. (Hey, reality TV was new then, and we actually thought it was … um … real?)After I got married at 40 and had a kid at 44, eight years ago, I was more likely to watch a reality show called “It’s Not Worth the Jail Time: Staying Sane During Motherhood” than I would a dating show.Yet I was one of the millions tuning into “The Golden Bachelor” premiere because I wanted to know how they would handle aging. I couldn’t care less who got a rose. For me the point was the people. The shiny, leggy, flowy-haired, high-heeled, high-boobed older (not old) women.The portrayal of these sexagenarians and septuagenarians — in other words boomers — bugged many people. By “people,” I mean some female critics. For instance, Mary McNamara lamented in The Los Angeles Times that the show was built on stereotypes, “to say nothing about the series’ focus on ‘hotness,’ which boils down to a very narrow definition of beauty and fitness.” There was also, Michelle Cottle who said in an audio essay for The New York Times that “these are not your grandma’s boomers so to speak, they are extremely toned and fit and tanned…. These women, in addition to trying to come across as attractive or personable or smart or charming are just so eager to prove they’re not old.”That’s exactly what I love about these women. They’re not my grandmother’s boomers, and they’re not even my mother’s.I’m a pretty basic Gen Xer who lost all her heels and stockings during the pandemic, more of a Sporty Spice than a Posh one. So while I’m fascinated by these women’s buxom bods and unlined, shiny faces that intimates a certain level of costly cosmetic help, I’m more obsessed with their personalities. “They are all focused on projecting the most youthful, up-for-anything, zippy, you know, sexually predatory vibe you can possibly come up with,” Cottle opined, as if it were the ultimate insult.As an older mom, I am fascinated by the media’s portrayal of older women.Listen, it’s not great. I wanted to love the 2022 novel “Vladimir” heralded as a #MeToo novel, but kept being thrown by the narrator, who keeps calling herself old even though she’s in her late 50s but complains about frailty like someone in her 80s. The novel and film adaptation “Still Alice” feature a woman in her 50s with early-onset Alzheimer’s. It’s as if once a woman turns 50, she’s out to pasture.But the 50s are not what they once were. Consider this: the women of “The Golden Girls” — Blanche, Dorothy and Rose — were in their 50s in 1985, when the show about old women began. Hard to believe they were about the same age that the characters of Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte are in the “Sex and the City” sequel series “And Just Like That….” (The show airs on Max, which shares a parent company with CNN.)While our favorite fancy New Yorkers are still teetering in their Manolo Blahnik heels and having over-priced brunches, they kept talking about their age (“I am not pretending to be any age. I am 55,” Charlotte says about dyeing her hair) and complaining about aging like they were … old. (Thankfully, they stopped talking about their age and aging in the second season, which also featured a surprise pregnancy that realistically ended in miscarriage.)The portrayal of older adults in the media has “changed dramatically” in the past two decades, said Galit Nimrod, author of “The Aging of Aquarius: The Hippies of the 60s in their 60s and Beyond,” noting that it has shifted from “characteristics such as frailty and dependency to vibrant, strong, active, and fit — a portrayal that is often unrealistic and denies aging altogether.” Our society puts older women in an “impossible position,” she said, due to the combination of ageism and misogyny. “If they try to maintain a younger lifestyle and especially a younger look, they are regarded as inauthentic and even pathetic,” she elaborated, acknowledging the adverse reactions Madonna got after her face lift. “If they don’t, they’re considered unattractive, non-feminine and even genderless.”It’s not that I want these Bachelor contestants’ fancy dresses, flat tummies or the ability to bat their eyelashes at the gorgeous Gerry like he was dessert they were about to pounce on (although I’m sure my husband of 12 years wouldn’t mind if I tried that with him). It’s their verve I want. It’s their vigor I need.As an older mom (do I have to keep saying that?? I’m like the contestant April, who introduced herself by saying, “I am 65 — I hate saying that!”) I had to crawl on my knees (not for that) to pick up the Legos strewn everywhere, run myself ragged in the playground playing hide and seek and now host relay races for my eight-year-old and friends. I don’t have time to rest.Our daughter looks at the world with enthusiasm and wonder — and that keeps my husband and me young, to see everything with delight and to keep up with her demands for novelty, adventure and action.That’s why I hope that by the time I’m the age of some of these contestants — with a teenage daughter — I still will have their “youthful, up-for-anything, zippy, kind of sexually predatory vibe.” I’m not saying we should ignore aging, per se, but I want to focus on life, on love, on living.I’m not the only one who loves these women. Even Gen Z women admire them. “Is anyone watching ‘The Golden Bachelor’ and thinking, ‘maybe I shouldn’t be so scared to get older….?’” Eva Gutowski said on TikTok. “I feel like as someone in her 20s it’s scary, like how am I going to look when I’m older? Is my personality going to be the same? Is it going to change? Am I going to want to party, meet new people, drink?” She said that seeing these women act so cool and look so stunning “also just makes me honestly excited to get older.”I’m excited for all of the women on “The Golden Bachelor,” who learned they deserve love. “From what I got out of the show the most, is gratitude for Gerry, for getting me to know I am worthy, I can enjoy my life and live it to the utmost and find happiness … I can’t wait to get started,” Ellen Goltzer, 71, recounted in the “Women Tell All” episode. Marina Perera, 60, one of two contestants who left the show early to prioritize her family, said, “Whether you’re 22 or 102, we are women, we have power within us.”If getting older means getting more vibrant, having more adventures, accessing that power within us — like all the contestants, whether they got a rose or a spin-off show — you can count me in.

CNN,The world’s richest man remains desperate for our attention,2023-11-30 14:29:00,Allison Morrow,"Elon Musk desperately wants to be liked, despite his pronouncement Wednesday that he doesn’t mind being hated. “Hate away,” he told Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook Summit.The sentiment is, like so much of Musk’s public persona, a lie designed to keep the public’s focus squarely on him.At the risk of over-pathologizing one of the most pathologized public figures on the planet, one thing Musk’s interview made clear is that he appears addicted to attention. And when adoration isn’t available, he’ll take condemnation like a shot of methadone.It’s why he bought a $44 billion personal megaphone. It’s why, at the Wednesday summit, he told advertisers that are leaving X (formerly Twitter) to “go f**k yourself,” relishing each word as he seemed to pat himself on the back for using such spicy language in front of a New York Times reporter.Watching the interview, even online, you can feel the awkward energy of that moment — cringeworthy for some, but seemingly invigorating for Musk.For better or worse, Musk and his antics matter because of the power he wields as an Extremely Rich Guy and the head of some of the most influential companies on Earth. If we can’t stop pathologizing, it’s because nearly every business decision Musk makes has ripple effects that matter down the line to regular people, whether they’re buying a Tesla in California or fighting a ground war in Eastern Europe.Increasingly, Musk is positioning himself as a public intellectual and someone with a role to play in global affairs like Israel’s war on Hamas. He clearly has the power (read: money) to inject himself into the middle of any conflict, but he lacks the maturity to use that power for much besides grandstanding.The trip to Israel followed his endorsement of an explicitly antisemitic tweet that sparked an advertiser exodus on X. He called the post — which amplified a conspiracy theory popular among White supremacists, that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites” — “the actual truth.” (On Wednesday, Musk swore the visit to Israel was not some kind of “apology tour,” another statement that strains credulity given the timing.)He is doing his best to combat accusations of antisemitism by stating that he is not antisemitic. But his past words and actions don’t do much to back up that claim.Musk has a long history, visible on his X timeline, of liking and otherwise propping up antisemitism, hate speech and conspiracy theories on the platform over which he exerts absolute control and where he boasts a following of more than 160 million accounts.On Wednesday, Musk sought to shrug off his most recent anti-Jewish post as a “foolish” mistake that got misinterpreted by the media. But even if that were true, we’d still have his Twitter feed, which is littered with banter with QAnon conspiracy theorists, many of whom had been banned from the platform before Musk resurrected their accounts.Just days after the antisemitic tweet that sparked an advertiser exodus, Musk moved on to engage with the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, breathing life into a 2016 lie that prompted a man to open fire in a DC restaurant.It should go without saying, but you don’t have to hold animosity in your heart to be a bigot. Tolerating bigotry, and giving air to it, in front of an audience of 160 million followers, is all it takes.Musk clearly has “a fairly straightforward case of internet brain rot,” as the Atlantic writer Charlie Warzel put it in a Threads post. “We know who this guy is by now but he absolutely isn’t going away.”",3543,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/tech/elon-musk-desperate-for-attention/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lack condemnation company effect leave post conspiracy sentiment shot moment rot invigorate role make spark endorsement israel awkward clear back matter ripple hatred feel visible credulity medium squarely internet atlantic earth pronouncement affair conflict platform ground pathologizing cringeworthy power persona million pizzagate follower history statement prompt megaphone inject time california apology writer bigot theorist accusation formerly focus straightforward resurrect interview relish sorkin pathologized f ban long intellectual buying mind call community read personal actual move pat supremacist middle sought available thread past warzel decision planet hamas antic influential trip energy hate dc fire action mistake x maturity musk wednesday jewish open strain speech breathing seemingly money shrug billion foolish feed combat explicitly absolute guy tweet boast stop rich adoration away brain summit state eastern charlie york exodus dealbook kind global prop front extremely audience popular tolerate life wields design timing ross figure andrew spicy told elon hold antisemitism online despite give put business timeline misinterpret antisemitic attention tour desperately regular risk word twitter visit language public tesla head absolutely bigotry follow play theory exerts qanon bought banter animosity case advertiser control addict white line litter fairly air engage lie recent heart position fight day amplify swore push,-0.8789,0.6773920406435224,8.489371428571427,0.3955956517277272,0,2023-11-30
ABC,"After hearing, judge mulls extending pause on John Oates' sale of stake in business with Daryl Hall",2023-11-30 14:22:00,JONATHAN MATTISE Associated Press,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A lawsuit by Daryl Hall over John Oates' plan to sell his potentially lucrative share of the Hall & Oates duo's joint venture without the other’s permission headed Thursday to court, where a judge will decide whether to keep pausing the deal.Chancellor Russell Perkins in Nashville said he would rule Thursday on whether, and how, to extend the pause on the sale of Oates’ share of Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave IP Investment Management LLC, while the music duo moves through the early stages of arbitration.The joint venture in question includes Hall & Oates trademarks, personal name and likeness rights, record royalty income and website and social media assets, according to a court declaration by Hall, who has called Oates' planned sale the “ultimate partnership betrayal. ″Christine Lepera, an attorney for Hall, said she hasn't heard anything from Oates' legal team indicating that there's some urgency in closing the deal.""You cannot sell half of a partnership to a third party without the other party’s consent, and that’s just intuitively correct,” Lepera said.An attorney for Oates, Tim Warnock, said Hall's claims that Oates went behind his back are untrue.“Mr. Oates proceeded exactly as he was allowed to proceed,” Warnock said, pointing the judge to their joint business agreement, which remains under seal in the case. ""Mr. Hall could have done the exact same thing himself.”The hearing also drew attention to Hall's claims in his declaration — that Oates blindsided and betrayed him, that their relationship and his trust in his musical partner have deteriorated, and that Oates timed the sale when Hall was about to go on tour to maximize the harm to him. Neither Hall nor Oates attended Thursday’s hearing.Warnock said some of the “salacious” allegations in Hall's declaration have nothing to do with what was being discussed in court Thursday.“Maybe he wanted publicity, maybe he wanted to interfere with Mr. Oates’ business relationships,"" Warnock said. ""We won’t know the answer to that today. We will know the answer to that at some point and there will be consequences about that.”Lepera replied that Hall had to submit an affidavit to support why the judge should keep temporarily blocking the deal.“That's the reason we did that, and not for publicity,” Lepera said.Artists have been fetching giant sums of money in recent years in selling their music catalogs. Oates would no doubt receive a large amount, given the massive run of hits the duo produced in the 1970s and ’80s, including “Maneater,” ""Rich Girl” “Kiss on My List” and “I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do).”The judge issued a temporary restraining order on Nov. 16, the same day Hall filed his lawsuit, writing that Oates and others involved in his trust can’t move to close the sale of their share until an arbitrator weighs in on the deal, or until the judge’s order expires — typically within 15 days, unless a judge extends the deadline.The parties have since agreed on who will oversee the arbitration, where the dispute over the deal will be decided, the attorneys said.The lawsuit contends that Hall opened an arbitration process on Nov. 9 against Oates and the other defendants in the lawsuit, Oates’ wife, Aimee Oates, as well as Richard Flynn, in their roles as co-trustees of Oates’ trust. Hall was seeking an order preventing them from selling their part in Whole Oats Enterprises to Primary Wave Music. Hall's declaration says he learned about the proposed deal for the first time on Oct. 20, about a week before he would begin touring across the U.S. west coast, Japan and Manilla.Primary Wave has already owned “significant interest” in Hall and Oates’ song catalog for more than 15 years.",3748,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/after-hearing-judge-mulls-extending-pause-john-oates-105281962,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point stage partner potentially consent salacious run nashville typically lawsuit social daryl significant dispute role oat llc oversee year back deal medium seal likeness duo income attorney john agreement part coast order warnock include reply close interfere fetch management permission mr hit team drew reason time proceed propose today betrayal joint plan website trust arbitrator ultimate intuitively llp decide accord correct involve japan court call personal move share music expires hearing richard enterprise sell claim perkins heard affidavit pause partnership defendant issue harm venture thursday learn blindside russell extend question write open record primary royalty rule maximize money receive judge arbitration produce girl seek interest declaration publicity rich indicate party trademark deteriorate attend oates west remains large allegation begin block restrain early relationship sum consequence wave file asset agree flynn song give business exact temporarily attention tour catalog doubt discuss half list investment amount lucrative answer massive head giant extends betrayed musical contends maneater temporary closing tim case weighs week submit legal prevent kiss wife recent aimee lepera process urgency day support hall ip,0.8956500000000001,0.0800426894343649,8.596657681940698,0.4208141321044548,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,‘The Maid’ was a surprise hit. Its sequel lives up to the hype.,2023-11-30 14:00:00,not specified,"Molly Gray, the heroine of “The Mystery Guest,” has inherited a trove of chipper maxims from her late grandmother, known as Gran, but the one she repeats most often is this gem about making hasty assumptions: “When you assume, you make an A-S-S out of U and ME.”I thought of that wisdom after I read “The Mystery Guest” and, then, went back and read its predecessor, “The Maid,” the best-selling 2022 novel by Nita Prose in which Molly made her debut. (Florence Pugh is to produce and star in the screen adaptation.) As someone whose tastes in mysteries skew toward the hard-boiled, I initially passed on “The Maid” because I assumed that a story featuring a hotel maid as an amateur detective was going to be stuffed with heartwarming fluff. Heartwarming, yes; but the only fluff in the Maid Novels, as this series is now called, is the deluxe filler in the pillows of the five-star Regency Grand Hotel where Molly works.Charming as the world of these mysteries can be, they’re also informed by tough truths about the routine humiliations of service employees like Molly and Gran. In their acute class-conscious commentary, Prose’s Maid Novels are worthy successors to Barbara Neely’s four award-winning Blanche White mysteries, featuring a middle-aged Black domestic worker rendered invisible to her mostly White employers, not only by her profession but by her race. Neely, who died in 2020, was recognized as a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America that same year.As Prose’s many fans already know, Molly is a sensitive young woman who processes the world differently. She’s hyper-attentive to details like, say, a tiny smudge on a TV remote. This single-minded focus makes Molly an excellent maid, but she’s not so sharp when it comes to reading people or catching the undertones of conversations. Amused by her diligence and demeanor, Molly’s meaner fellow employees at the Regency Grand mock her with names like “Roomba the Robot.”“The Mystery Guest,” however, finds Molly in a better position, professionally and personally, than she was a few years earlier. She’s been promoted to head maid and she’s happily living with Juan Manuel, the sweet kitchen worker who had fallen into the grip of a predatory co-worker in the earlier novel. Juan is visiting his family in Mexico, so he’s not on hand to help in this outing, which finds Molly confronting a real mess: the death of a famous mystery writer, J.D. Grimthorpe, who keeled over while he was signing books at a reception at the Regency Grand. Foul play is involved.To make matters even more muddled, Molly spent a fair bit of time with Grimthorpe when she was a child, because Gran worked as a housemaid for him and his wife. In alternating flashback chapters, we learn that Gran was forced to take Molly along with her to the Grimthorpe mansion after bullying by Molly’s classmates — and even some of her teachers — became intolerable. The scene where Gran, with young Molly in tow, must bow and scrape before the censorious Mrs. Grimthorpe will resonate with anyone who’s ever had to bring their child into a less-than-welcoming workplace.Although young Molly and Grimthorpe became unlikely friends, he fails to recognize her at that fatal reception at the Regency Grand, even when she steps in front of him to have her copy of his latest book signed. (“How was it possible that I remembered everything about him but he did not remember me?”) Because of their proximity to the victim and the murder weapon, Molly and her protégé — a nervous young woman named Lily Finch — become the prime suspects of the police investigation. Molly is also troubled by the strange behavior of her good friend Mr. Preston, the doorman at the Regency. As she digs deeper into the past to ferret out the truth about Grimthorpe and his murder, Molly also despairs of her own limitations. “I was afraid of myself, of my infinite capacity for understanding things too late.”Throughout this novel and its predecessor, Prose vividly depicts working people stuck in tight places with no easy exits. As Gran told Molly when she was a little girl, her eyes filling with tears, “You deserve better, but I don’t know what else to do.” The fact that our narrator Molly, even as an adult, can’t quite give voice to the emotions she’s recalling or witnessing adds poignancy to these moments.“The Mystery Guest” isn’t as intricately plotted as its superb predecessor, but Prose scatters enough revelations throughout this tale to keep tension on a moderate setting. Besides, the characters of Molly and her beloved Gran, women who are overlooked because of the kind of work they do, are the overwhelming draw of the Maid Novels. In this affecting and socially pointed mystery series, invisibility becomes the superpower of the pink-collared proletariat.Maureen Corrigan, who is the book critic for the NPR program “Fresh Air,” teaches literature at Georgetown University.A Maid NovelBy Nita Prose",4936,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/12/01/mystery-guest-nita-prose-book-review-/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story point screen undertone grand corrigan pass america adaptation program grip tough fill trove amuse promote possible draw race bit housemaid teach intolerable adult heroine worker resonate chapter make real finch humiliation teacher sign literature fails doorman year voice matter back feature worthy deluxe master witness remote personally routine eye initially signing assume murder employee fluff late mansion tiny manuel famous affect detail kitchen time woman writer wisdom focus pugh bow barbara moderate find acute differently hand behavior family mexico call read diligence troubled inform afraid foul infinite sensitive tension professionally easy catch pillow blanche nita successor past service recognize filler beloved juan invisible truth georgetown set exit repeat tow profession skew spent reading classmate learn censorious limitation stuck scene molly fall domestic bring intricately npr grimthorpe guest proximity protégé chipper produce poignancy girl assumption maxim fresh lily prose gray depicts fellow tight superpower victim bullying tear force hasty excellent book character strange commentary place suspect ferret superb novelby nervous fatal understand series flashback detective kind front work tv invisibility critic smudge step add fair investigation conversation told meaner employer living muddle keel heartwarming predatory amateur police mystery recall confront reception young give death preston child weapon friend despair prime happily gem narrator capacity remember world visit plot mock overlook head black regency overwhelm taste florence socially predecessor play inherit sweet gran render sharp maid vividly emotion copy neely earlier white mess star scrape revelation scatter air stuffed demeanor wife roomba fact grandmother alternate debut position process deserve deeper,0.93415,0.0,8.368139773895166,0.5718650793650794,0,2023-11-30
ABC,Brazilian city enacts an ordinance that was secretly written by ChatGPT,2023-11-30 13:59:00,DIANE JEANTET Associated Press and MAURICIO SAVARESE Associated Press,"RIO DE JANEIRO -- City lawmakers in Brazil have enacted what appears to be the nation’s first legislation written entirely by artificial intelligence — even if they didn't know it at the time.The experimental ordinance was passed in October in the southern city of Porto Alegre and city councilman Ramiro Rosário revealed this week that it was written by a chatbot, sparking objections and raising questions about the role of artificial intelligence in public policy.Rosário told The Associated Press that he asked OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT to craft a proposal to prevent the city from charging taxpayers to replace water consumption meters if they are stolen. He then presented it to his 35 peers on the council without making a single change or even letting them know about its unprecedented origin.“If I had revealed it before, the proposal certainly wouldn't even have been taken to a vote,"" Rosário told the AP by phone on Thursday. The 36-member council approved it unanimously and the ordinance went into effect on Nov. 23.“It would be unfair to the population to run the risk of the project not being approved simply because it was written by artificial intelligence,” he added.The arrival of ChatGPT on the marketplace just a year ago has sparked a global debate on the impacts of potentially revolutionary AI-powered chatbots. While some see it as a promising tool, it has also caused concerns and anxiety about the unintended or undesired impacts of a machine handling tasks currently performed by humans.Porto Alegre, with a population of 1.3 million, is the second-largest city in Brazil's south. The city's council president, Hamilton Sossmeier, found out that Rosário had enlisted ChatGPT to write the proposal when the councilman bragged about the achievement on social media on Wednesday. Sossmeier initially told local media he thought it was a “dangerous precedent.”The AI large language models that power chatbots like ChatGPT work by repeatedly trying to guess the next word in a sentence and are prone to making up false information, a phenomenon sometimes called hallucination.All chatbots sometimes introduce false information when summarizing a document, ranging from about 3% of the time for the most advanced GPT model to a rate of about 27% for one of Google’s models, according to recently published research by the tech company Vectara.In an article published on the website of Harvard Law School’s Center of Legal Profession earlier this year, Andrew Perlman, dean at Suffolk University Law School, wrote that ChatGPT “may portend an even more momentous shift than the advent of the internet,” but also warned of its potential shortcomings.“It may not always be able to account for the nuances and complexities of the law. Because ChatGPT is a machine learning system, it may not have the same level of understanding and judgment as a human lawyer when it comes to interpreting legal principles and precedent. This could lead to problems in situations where a more in-depth legal analysis is required,” Perlman wrote.Porto Alegre's Rosário wasn't the first lawmaker in the world to test ChatGPT's abilities. Others have done so in a more limited capacity or with less successful outcomes.In Massachusetts, Democratic state Sen. Barry Finegold turned to ChatGPT to help write a bill aimed at regulating artificial intelligence models, including ChatGPT. Filed earlier this year, it has yet to be voted on.Finegold said by phone on Wednesday that ChatGPT can help with some of the more tedious elements of the lawmaking process, including correctly and quickly searching and citing laws already on the books. However, it is critical that everyone knows ChatGPT or a similar tool was used in the process, he added.“We want work that is ChatGPT generated to be watermarked,” he said, adding that the use of artificial intelligence to help draft new laws is inevitable. “I’m in favor of people using ChatGPT to write bills as long as it’s clear.”There was no such transparency for Rosário's proposal in Porto Alegre. Sossmeier said Rosário did not inform fellow council members that ChatGPT had written the proposal.Keeping the proposal's origin secret was intentional. Rosário told the AP his objective was not just to resolve a local issue, but also to spark a debate. He said he entered a 49-word prompt into ChatGPT and it returned the full draft proposal within seconds, including justifications.“I am convinced that ... humanity will experience a new technological revolution,” he said. “All the tools we have developed as a civilization can be used for evil and good. That’s why we have to show how it can be used for good.”And the council president, who initially decried the method, already appears to have been swayed.“I changed my mind,” Sossmeier said. “I started to read more in depth and saw that, unfortunately or fortunately, this is going to be a trend.”_____",4901,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/brazilian-city-enacts-ordinance-secretly-written-surprising-new-105281535,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,peer hamilton potentially run company information pass chatgpt achievement effect nation press artificial project decry social draft south tool revolution role gpt handle make center spark janeiro tedious year civilization level guess medium developed principle element analysis turn internet sentence google dean initially include objective ordinance water quickly recently million ramiro power undesired rate change perform convince porto brag prompt advent phenomenon time steal system craft enter website democratic interpret revolutionary unfair start long accord mind proposal intelligence call city read simply inform impact secret associate ability nuance method october machine successful entirely southern aim experimental single issue perlman advanced task search profession document shift openai thursday momentous learn correctly found approve unprecedented false write question wednesday full university consumption summarize tech rosário anxiety legislation population harvard technological watermarked promising regulate unanimously phone currently replace fellow councilman barry similar school range limited present state book bill debate require large model humanity repeatedly president understand enact global raise fortunately work potential massachusetts add andrew ago told depth research meter generate council resolve prone vote complexity inevitable file brazil charge experience lawmaking alegre arrival finegold risk chatbots introduce rio test precedent lawyer capacity word world publish language public lead unintended show portend transparency taxpayer account return member law evil enlist marketplace intentional sossmeier suffolk problem origin critical unfortunately earlier week legal favor local prevent concern chatbot lawmaker process warn human objection article situation judgment reveal dangerous,0.2316999999999999,0.3060599877576005,10.395254988913525,0.480490832696715,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,Elon Musk’s masculine costume,2023-11-30 13:45:00,Rachel Tashjian,"Sitting on a stage Wednesday at the New York Times DealBook conference, Elon Musk was dressed like a caricature of mid-century rogue masculinity: in a leather flight jacket with a fur-lined collar.The jacket, which the business executive has worn for previous live interviews, is a take on the G1 and nylon A1 worn by movie stars who posed for black-and-white photographs, with perhaps a cigarette in hand and slight smile on their lips. The image fixed in many minds a male archetype of mischievous strength that persists despite shifts in gender norms, in part due to retrograde figures such as Jordan Peterson who opine on the plight of men.Most memorably, it was the signature jacket of “Top Gun” hero Maverick, played by Tom Cruise — a naughty boy who breaks the rules and gets in trouble, but only because he knows it’s worth it (and because it’s fun). In one of the most famous images of Cruise in the jacket, his teacher, who becomes his lover, has one hand slipped into it and the other yanking at its collar. Were we ever so young? (Or so … manly?)You can see where Musk was going with this get-up; he’s nothing if not obvious, and to underscore it, he wore the look with dog tags, black jeans and shiny leather boots. (Too shiny — they betrayed his fanciness. Clint Eastwood wouldn’t trust a boot he could see his reflection in.)The necklace appears to be a pendant sold by a 501(c)(3) working on the return of Israeli hostages, and reads “Bring them home now” — a sign that he perhaps takes the accusations of antisemitism on his platform seriously. He received the necklace from the father of an Israeli taken hostage by Hamas while visiting the country this week, vowing on X to wear it “every day until your loved ones are released.” He emphasized that the visit was long in the works and not an “apology tour.”Musk is a man in crisis, as the ensuing interview underscored. When asked about advertisers who have left X (formerly Twitter) because of concerns that the platform and the leader himself are amplifying antisemitism, Musk said, “If someone’s going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f--- yourself.”Perhaps that’s how he thinks men who wear such clothes talk. The incredible and even comic synergy of Musk’s behavior and attire is cinematic by design — clothing as entertainment and commentary. (Several people on X compared Musk’s interview to the outrageous dialogue and public embarrassments of “Succession,” and in fact, in the final season that aired this past spring, Jeremy Strong, as the self-pitying heir apparent Kendall Roy, wore a flight jacket that he said was inspired by another piece of Musk outerwear.) Thursday was the official launch of Tesla’s first truck, and one can see how the jacket would be the perfect look of reassurance for anyone worried that the smooth quiet of electric vehicles is at odds with horsepower and big tires. Instead, his behavior made him look fussy, ridiculous. You’re wearing Maverick’s jacket — and you’re arguing about tweets?There’s a long-held perception that Silicon Valley’s male mavericks (heh) don’t think about their clothes, but in fact they appear to ponder them more than any businessman who puts on the same blue suit or skinny chinos and button-up everyday. Think Jack Dorsey and his philosophical approach to wearing Rick Owens, Mark Zuckerberg and his decision to upgrade his uniform T-shirt and jeans by swapping the tee for a $300 version by Brunello Cucinelli.But none of these figures is as attached to the power of wearing the right garment as Musk. According to GQ, he called upon designer Emily Dawn Long to style him throughout 2018, including for that year’s Met Gala. Together, they looked to male icons such as Harrison Ford, Paul Newman and Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton, who seems to have inspired the acquisition of the jacket, which he wore for a South by Southwest interview that year. (His boots then were more distressed.)Musk seems to understand that fashion is a powerful tool for mythmaking — that replacing one uniform with another, or better yet, with a costume, will help a public figure who often misspeaks to be seen irrefutably in the way he hopes to be.",4210,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2023/11/30/elon-musk-style/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hero stage leader version image jean photograph south tool final movie uniform make worried sign teacher year trouble smile incredible jeremy tee owen part embarrassment include caricature fun platform retrograde electric underscored power blackmail skinny strength zuckerberg famous dialogue wore time emphasize apology gun due odds accusation formerly necklace home underscore ridiculous interview style eastwood attire trust f ponder succession paul male hand long big accord behavior roy collar mind call executive archetype read naughty love israeli sell manly perception past vehicle perfect decision memorably hamas horsepower irrefutably persists approach dorsey heh shift clint thursday plight antarctic talk crisis spring apparent masculinity x musk wednesday reassurance flight father break worth valley bring opine vow fashion conference rule money attach receive left rogue outerwear boot pendant instead entertainment ernest played swap quiet tweet silicon smooth replace brunello launch country reflection gala lover commentary lip piece york dealbook understand comic mischievous strong southwest truck season work wear newman explorer official design figure heir powerful jordan mark elon shackleton jacket fix advertising businessman pose chino antisemitism despite worn young put business live signature peterson clothes nylon dawn cinematic boy cigarette everyday tire twitter ensue argue visit upgrade obvious public tesla maverick cruise fussy betrayed return leather black clothing tom previous norm inspire mythmaking tag rick kendall emily synergy misspeaks advertiser ford slip week star concern philosophical compare air shiny dress outrageous hope costume jack suit fact hostage designer distressed gq day amplify blue yank harrison top acquisition icon garment gender slight fanciness,0.984,0.2137767220902612,7.529180327868847,0.4421987734487735,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Louis Vuitton stages dramatic runway show in Hong Kong,2023-11-30 13:37:00,Stephy Chung,"Louis Vuitton’s creative director for menswear Pharrell Williams signaled the label’s ambitions in Asia on Thursday evening, staging a playful show under the lights of Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour.The American musician and designer, who in June shut down Paris’ Pont Neuf bridge to showcase his debut collection for the label, continued his high-profile tenure at the brand by unveiling its latest looks against one of the world’s most iconic skylines.The event saw models walking an outdoor runway at the Avenue of Stars — Hong Kong’s answer to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Cantopop singer Anson Lo, K-Pop boy band TXT and South Korean actor Song Joong-ki were among the celebrities in attendance.The show was themed on travel, everywhere from “Hawaii to Hong Kong,” said Williams. Speaking to CNN just hours before, he described the collection as having “a very hyper focus on dandy” — expressed through its “sailor side” and “resort side,” he added.In a nod to what the brand described as the city’s seafaring history, the runway’s maritime theme saw musicians in sailor hats strumming ukuleles, a catwalk covered in sand and digital displays screening lapping waves.Models — who included members of Hawaii’s surf communities — swept along the harborfront in striped suits, sailing jackets, fisherman-style sandals and tropical floral prints, with Williams’ relaxed silhouettes and embellishments giving some outfits the feel of elevated beachwear. Many of the looks were completed with naval accessories, like raffia bucket hats and Louis Vuitton Keepall 25 bag hand-embrodiered with seashells.The sky then filled with dozens of drones, taking on forms including the brand’s LVERS logo — a combination of the classic LV monogram with the word lovers, a philosophy at the heart of Williams’ practice, according to the show notes — before he emerged to take a bow.“It’s a luxury house, but this luxury house was founded on the traveler — the world traveler,” he told CNN. “And here it’s landed us in Hong Kong.”The French label appointed Williams in February following the death of his predecessor, Virgil Abloh. As well as putting on a spectacular show at Paris Men’s Fashion Week, complete with an orchestra and gospel choir, Williams has already reimagined some of the brand’s classics — such as a version of its Speedy bag in crocodile leather, a design only available to select customers and priced at $1 million (giving the bag its nickname, the “Millionaire Speedy”).When asked to reflect on the pressures accompanying one of fashion’s top jobs, Williams told CNN, “Oh the pleasure is amazing. You said pressure, I said pleasure. What’s hard about pleasure?”Thursday’s event marked Louis Vuitton’s first ever pre-fall menswear show. And while pre-fall collections are not considered as prestigious as labels’ Spring-Summer or Fall-Winter lines, the move nonetheless demonstrated the importance of Hong Kong — and Asia at large — to the French fashion house’s expansion plans.Louis Vuitton opened its first boutique in Hong Kong in 1979. The city’s residents now spend more on luxury goods, per capita, than anywhere else in the world, according to market research firm Euromonitor. It has also traditionally been a popular destination for the wider region’s luxury shoppers, thanks to the absence of sales tax in the territory.Earlier this week, Dior, which is owned by Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH, announced that it too will unveil its men’s pre-fall collection in Hong Kong, at a undisclosed venue, early next year.This can also be considered something of a coup for Hong Kong, which is working to restore its international reputation as a go-to destination following years of some of the world’s strictest Covid-19 travel restrictions and the introduction of a controversial National Security Law that critics say threaten political freedoms and civil liberties.Recent months have seen officials attempt to lure tourists back to the city with its “Hello Hong Kong” campaign, which included a giveaway of 500,000 free airline tickets. In a brief statement published Tuesday, the Hong Kong Tourism Board described the Louis Vuitton event as “making fashion history.”Organized alongside K11 Group, which operates a mall beside the Avenue of Stars and the area’s wider art and design district Victoria Dockside, the runway was also livestreamed around Hong Kong via digital billboards.The show also marked a continuation of Louis Vuitton’s attempts to court lucrative Asian markets. Although LVMH does not disclose the performance of individual brands, the French conglomerate’s rebound in profits was partly fueled by resumed Chinese spending after China’s post-Covid reopening.In 2020, during the height of pandemic, the label’s menswear division eschewed a digital edition of Paris Men’s Fashion Week to instead debut its newest collection in mainland China. Then under Abloh’s leadership, the brand showed formal garments, animal-themed streetwear and bright block colors on the banks of the Huangpu River in Shanghai.Louis Vuitton’s womenswear division, meanwhile, hosted its first major show in South Korea this past April, when it transformed Seoul’s Jamsugyo Bridge into a striking runway.But beyond the region’s strategic importance, the choice of Hong Kong was, for Williams, personal. The 50-year-old said he had felt “incredibly supported” by the city in the past, and has held a number of collaborations and events there in recent years, including a private sale launched by his digital auction platform Joopiter and jeweler Lorraine Schwartz back in March. “I definitely knew I wanted Hong Kong to be my second stop after Paris,” he said of his Louis Vuitton show schedule.And after years living with the pandemic, the Asian city feels like it’s “back in the business,” Williams added.“The slingshot is pulled back as far as it can go, and (it’s) about to let go… from a deep serious ebbing into a very serious energic flow,” he said. “You’re going to see it across business and all the different sectors, from fashion all the way to finance.“I think it’s very serendipitous that we get to come here right when things are just about to transform.”",6176,https://www.cnn.com/style/louis-vuitton-hong-kong-fashion-show/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,appoint screen express womenswear company maritime international version strike organize host formal asia boutique swept region customer disclose fill runway pandemic caput announce logo auction south print color american mainland chinese make brand venue airline surf year accessory fuel back digital feel freedom naval celebrity orchestra pharrell embellishment outfit mall include definitely singer platform political firm million tropical display late dandy history statement choice undisclosed ambition gospel ticket form pull silhouette hour musician menswear lv walk lorraine victoria focus partly april tax wider shut cnn seafaring avenue playful alongside reflect accord complete hollywood accompany security court threaten community energic city side move personal band sailor light operates french demonstrate choir lvmh reimagined available amaze hong raffia resident fame past knew elevate philosophy huangpu neuf abloh china river asian dozen pont land floral actor signal profit streetwear event cantopop spectacular select continued outdoor strum lure height thursday found deep strictest luxury price korea rebound open collection note speedy market traveler number free paris virgil anson fashion sector month strip classic sand instead tenure unveil emerge pressure kong attempt practice stop board monogram controversial importance restore sail bridge ukulele creative stag crocodile launch performance marked parent transform vuitton iconic hard lover private model large civil campaign tourist joopiter block nickname hyper beachwear early popular collaboration national work june critic harborfront job official house art design introduction bank txt february incredibly reputation director travel told edition continuation hawaii keepall sandal research felt living nonetheless jacket cover showcase song give put business label coup death destination spend slingshot sky spending traditionally flow district millionaire catwalk division boy consider livestreamed bucket word theme world combination major absence publish lucrative answer show dockside ebb member different law leather pleasure eschew euromonitor follow expansion serendipitous predecessor prestigious tuesday restriction described tourism conglomerate resort week held star line dior giveaway leadership group individual strategic jeweler bright recent suit heart seoul nod designer bag area drone debut schwartz korean relaxed march louis shopper resume support speak top lvers garment jamsugyo williams,0.9896,0.0485751295336787,9.72370118845501,0.3910163139329806,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,"Finally, a killer ‘Sunset Boulevard’ with the perfect Norma Desmond",2023-11-30 13:24:00,Peter Marks,"LONDON — “Let’s get a look at you!” exclaims Hawkeye, the back-lot spotlight operator, as Norma Desmond, in the form of drop-dead dazzling Nicole Scherzinger, stands before us like a haunted moth, drawn to the all-consuming flame.The powerful white light fixes on her slender, dancer’s figure, cloaked in a satiny black shift, and the audience at the Savoy Theatre is now the moth to her flame. What happens next in director Jamie Lloyd’s killer revival of “Sunset Boulevard” — killer because it obliterates the memory of all other versions of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical — is a rendition of “As If We Never Said Goodbye” that accomplishes the aim of theater at its devilish best. It slays you, too.Incorporating techniques that hearken a Hollywood age before, as Norma puts it, “the pictures got smaller,” Jamie Lloyd’s “Sunset Boulevard” not only illuminates the 1994 musical in a big, new way, it also gives an exhilarating boost to the entire revival genre.By creating a captivating filmic framework and adding the hypnotic modern choreography of Fabian Aloise, Lloyd finds visual vocabularies that heighten the story’s epic thrust. In an equally successful conceit, Lloyd Webber’s music, roaring and swelling like the melodramatic movie scores of yore, provides surefire enhancement for the larger-than-life images the director brings to the Savoy stage.Largest of all is the amazing Scherzinger, who conveys the manipulativeness, the glamour, the brutal terror of a movie goddess sent crashing back down to earth. Previous incarnations of the musical, starring the likes of Glenn Close, Patti LuPone and Betty Buckley, sought to pay homage to the star of Billy Wilder’s seminal 1950 movie, Gloria Swanson, herself at the time a faded silent-film queen. Lloyd changes up the playbook in a version both of its time and out of it: This Norma would not be caught dead wearing a Hollywood dinosaur’s turban.No, Scherzinger is her own Norma, aware not just of the power of celebrity — even if it’s only of the where-is-she-now? kind — but also of her sexual power. It makes sense that this vital Norma is driven mad by Tinseltown’s obsession with youth. What’s the old joke? A Hollywood actress goes from ingenue to district attorney to “Driving Miss Daisy”?The notion of her visceral power is reiterated every time Scherzinger opens up her throat for one of Lloyd Webber’s big numbers, especially Act 1’s intoxicating “With One Look.” Music director Alan Williams’s 17-member orchestra and Adam Fisher’s sound design strongly contribute to the ear-filling richness. Indeed, the design elements, including a film noir palette in the sets and costumes by Soutra Gilmour, are all of a dynamic piece.Whose inspired idea was recruiting Scherzinger, best known as the lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls? (And more recently a fixture on TV talent shows.) Her casting as erstwhile screen siren is the production’s most exciting brainstorm; you can imagine her as a celluloid Cleopatra. Still, it’s far from the only smart choice. With videographers roaming the Savoy stage, projecting actors’ faces onto a huge screen so crisply you can see into their pores, the director ingeniously invites the camera to be a full artistic partner.Lloyd makes mischief, too, with theatrical transparency. Wait for the funny sequence in which the cameras, “Saturday Night Live” style, trail backstage behind Tom Francis, himself a sterling presence as the doomed screenwriter Joe Gillis. It’s an effort at demystification, in keeping with the spirit of a musical about the human toll of mythmaking. Dreams figure prominently in the self-conscious lyrics of Don Black and Christopher Hampton: “We gave the world new ways to dream,” goes one of the musical’s constant refrains. “Sunset Boulevard” is very much concerned with the tawdry dreams Hollywood sells.Other major characters, including David Thaxton’s Max von Mayerling, Norma’s all-purpose amanuensis, and Grace Hodgett Young’s Betty Schaefer, the studio assistant who falls in love with Joe, have been smartly rethought: Max’s grating lugubriousness has been erased thanks to Thaxton’s virile, brooding portrayal, and Young’s Betty seems stronger — more conscious of Hollywood’s cynical establishment — and therefore, more appealingly contemporary.The evening, though, rises and falls on Norma. And Scherzinger ascends and ascends and ascends. Or maybe descends is the better verb. As the star’s grip on reality, and on Joe, falters, we go straight to figurative hell with horror-movie Norma. Protesting one last desperate time that she is the greatest star of all, Scherzinger twists Norma’s features grotesquely: She looks for a disquieting moment like Voldemort.At long, long last, she’s ready for her crackup.",4750,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater/2023/11/30/sunset-boulevard-scherzinger-jamie-lloyd/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story stage screen version ascends image grip glamour grotesquely contribute project twist grace brooding moment excite slays toll notion movie lloyd obsession make rise caught great wait back act feature dream incarnation moth celebrity attorney element orchestra assistant dead desmond funny satiny include earth small daisy hypnotic singer close operator recently power entire presence change lyric visceral christopher buckley crackup mad choice picture form huge adam rethought spirit time homage enhancement especially revival epic doll dinosaur obliterates youth london roar aloise drive amanuensis style spotlight cloaked find imagine screenwriter hell long big provide rendition hollywood siren refrain sexual backstage slender pussycat palette francis love music light max fabian sought camera protest score establishment goodbye amaze gillis straight successful brutal crash indeed aware patti exclaims swell aim actress fisher actor killer melodramatic set nicole disquiet betty thrust shift falter idea pay framework fade studio savoy virile open full fall seminal sterling number ingenue roam tinseltown heighten sunset ready doom figurative driven appealingly conveys surefire manipulativeness night conceit erase drawn strongly visual erstwhile smart joe throat concerned invite vital accomplishes crisply exhilarate artistic character equally swanson effort modern technique portrayal kind alan goddess noir strong verb devilish audience age tv playbook memory wear add tawdry design sound fixture figure theatre powerful andrew theater director brings demystification reiterate dynamic glenn hampton fix haunt hawkeye film prominently pore boulevard yore desperate dancer give young production put boost live cynical vocabulary choreography cast district recruiting soutra miss queen cleopatra joke hodgett theatrical grate wilder world saturday major ingeniously lead reality show transparency lugubriousness musical gloria dazzle black tom descends mischief previous inspire billy mythmaking gilmour mayerling thaxton flame trail celluloid white brainstorm richness sequence star smartly filmic constant costume webber david talent schaefer captivate hearken human videographers norma create lupone intoxicate scherzinger conscious illuminates stand jamie williams terror,0.98845,0.4421052631578946,9.00464712269272,0.5181101600419783,0,2023-11-30

Washington Post,‘Godzilla Minus One’: A monster movie with a giant heart,2023-11-30 12:57:00,Lucas Trevor,"The creature-feature title notwithstanding, “Godzilla Minus One” could easily be mistaken for a 1950s romantic melodrama. On one level, it’s the story of a Japanese couple raising a small child in the aftermath of World War II. Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a former kamikaze pilot who survived only because he abandoned his mission, feels shame for his cowardice and wants to make up for his mistake. Noriko (Minami Hamabe) is his nontraditional partner; they sleep in separate beds but have a strong emotional bond. Together, they live in bombed-out Tokyo — across the street from their sometimes babysitter and frequent parenting adviser — with the baby girl Noriko has taken in after promising a dying women she would take care of her child. There’s not enough work, the roof leaks and Koichi has what today would be called PTSD.Oh, and there’s a 200-foot-tall lizard terrorizing the country.In this reboot of the 1954 “Godzilla,” filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki — juggling the jobs of writer, director and visual effects supervisor — mixes the tried-and-true beats of a modern blockbuster with the emotional and political tone of the original film. The result is nothing short of magical: a feast for the eyes, an entertaining epic in every sense of the word.The film begins late at night, during the final days of the war at an isolated airstrip that is suddenly attacked by a mysterious creature. While many modern Godzilla adaptations lean into size and spectacle, Yamazaki prefers suspense, shooting from below to return the titular creature, or kaiju, to its horror roots. This Godzilla is, for the first time in a long while, genuinely terrifying. Only later does Yamazaki shows the rampage from a wider angle. The spectacle returns, but with an added edge: Godzilla is not a boxer going toe to toe in a ring with another kaiju, but certain death slowly inching toward you.While the recent American Godzilla films (part of a monster-verse that includes King Kong and other so-called titans) have their strengths, their focus on science fiction, advanced tech and backstories involving ancient civilization has eliminated some of the human emotion of the original film. Here, it’s up to ordinary people, not other monsters, to stop Godzilla. This ups the emotional stakes.Monster movies live and die by such investment of feeling — and it’s there that “Minus One” thrives. The first hour features little of the titular reptile, instead focusing on the connection between Koichi and Noriko, which begins with her handing him a baby as she runs from what we’re led to believe is an angry shopkeeper. Eventually, Noriko moves in, and they grow in fondness for each other in the wreckage of their country.The first half of the film does most of the heavy lifting, establishing the intense sentiment that is essential for the second half. Even after Godzilla returns, the film’s tender core is carefully nurtured.That’s not to say the spectacle isn’t also effective. The scenes of urban devastation are expertly choreographed and gorgeously shot (by Kozo Shibasaki). If, in some of the large-scale scenes, you can feel the impact of the film’s comparatively small budget, the majority of the effects are well-constructed. For example, the film’s rendering of Godzilla’s “atomic breath” — a blue-white beam that shoots out of its mouth — is astounding. The buildup to its first appearance is electric, a sensation of raw power that does not diminish as the effect is reused.The Godzilla franchise had — and still has — deeply political implications. The 1954 film critiqued the Atomic Age and the effect of nuclear weapons on the planet broadly (and on Japan more specifically). That implication remains valid, with sequences in Tokyo eerily evocative of photographs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Layered on top of that is criticism of Japan’s imperial government and the military’s policy of self-sacrifice, underscored by Koichi’s refusal to “die honorably.”The final act features some of the best blockbuster filmmaking in years. Naoki Sato’s score builds as repurposed Navy cruisers engage with Godzilla in open water. At their best, such action sequences operate like symphonies: individual instruments moving as one and responding to one another. When well orchestrated, they result in catharsis. Yamazaki achieves this, creating a climax reminiscent of the best work of action directors Kathryn Bigelow, James Cameron and Christopher McQuarrie.“Top Gun: Maverick” showed us there’s still an audience for movies that combine concise and creative action with emotionally resonant characters. “Godzilla Minus One” is another reminder — and quite possibly the better movie of the two.",4680,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/11/30/godzilla-minus-one-movie-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story implication partner run japanese slowly kozo titan nuclear effect adaptation pilot separate fiction sentiment nontraditional shot shoot photograph minus reminiscent ups shame final american instrument movie koichi make spectacle aftermath year civilization level military yamazaki carefully kamikaze act feature feel result mouth repurposed science angle backstories shopkeeper king part sensation hiroshima imperial eye include small tone juggling cowardice melodrama kaiju political electric water underscored power government late effective strength mysterious christopher beat mistaken expertly hour bond time woman writer gun epic edge focus takashi boxer today wider suspense beam core baby long airstrip hand involve japan entertain mission call feast kathryn move diminish bigelow emotional noriko impact score thrives sato emotionally valid atomic isolated bed eliminate essential planet toe street advanced gorgeously attack frequent inch ancient budget action size monster abandon mistake open scene majority buildup supervisor choreographed tech terrorize creature critique symphony reboot reptile couple filmmaker instead heavy girl suddenly night comparatively easily visual kong reminder stop promising godzilla creative believe connection policy roof eventually parent orchestrate adviser remains character modern broadly franchise begin specifically strong evocative raise audience original wreckage work age add lift job urban operate catharsis appearance cameron director layer eerily survive babysitter blockbuster tokyo film shibasaki ryunosuke leak death child live weapon hamabe james former refusal romantic climax build intense criticism ring half rampage tender world investment deeply lead maverick concise show terrify cruiser return ordinary navy filmmaking astound lizard prefers angry naoki render respond possibly mix grow emotion genuinely short combine establish sequence achieves engage individual fondness recent title raw kamiki magical horror resonant sleep day human create devastation lean top root nagasaki minami titular breath notwithstanding,0.3826,0.3846153846153846,9.409819004524884,0.4580191528329826,0,2023-11-30

ABC,Judge allows mention of accuser's arrest in Jonathan Majors' trial on domestic violence charges,2023-11-30 12:51:00,Aaron Katersky and Meredith Deliso,"Defense attorneys for Marvel star Jonathan Majors will be allowed to tell the jury about his accuser's recent arrest in connection with the domestic violence case, the judge decided Thursday on the second day of the trial.Majors, 34, faces misdemeanor assault and harassment charges stemming from an incident in New York City in March with his then-girlfriend, Grace Jabbari, whose case the Manhattan district attorney's office dropped.The Emmy-nominated actor was arrested after officers responded to a 911 call in Manhattan for an alleged domestic dispute. He subsequently filed a cross-complaint against Jabbari, alleging he was the one assaulted.Jabbari was arrested in October in New York on multiple charges, though the Manhattan district attorney's office subsequently said it decided not to prosecute her because the case ""lacks prosecutorial merit.""The defense argued her arrest is ""part and parcel"" of its case.""There is no case law the People have cited that prevents the defense from asking Ms. Jabbari about her actions that night,"" defense attorney Seth Zuckerman said.Prosecutors had asked the judge to preclude the defense from discussing Jabbari's arrest.""This was not a quid pro quo,"" assistant district attorney Kelli Galaway said. ""This was not a benefit she received.""Judge Michael Gaffey ultimately decided on Thursday to allow the defense to bring up her arrest during the trial.Majors is accused of twisting Jabbari's arm behind her back, striking her in the head and pushing her into a vehicle, a criminal complaint alleges. She was treated at a hospital for minor neck and head injuries, including a cut to her ear, police said.He has denied the assault. His attorney, Priya Chaudhry, said Majors is heard on police body camera footage telling officers ""She slapped me"" and ""She ripped my coat"" before they arrested him. The defense has claimed that authorities failed to properly evaluate his account before moving forward with misdemeanor charges.Ross Kramer, an attorney for Jabbari, called her arrest ""unfortunate and re-traumatizing"" in a statement to The Associated Press in October.The Manhattan district attorney's office ""carefully reviewed all the facts of the case and concluded that Ms. Jabbari was the victim, and not the perpetrator,"" the statement to the AP said.Majors has pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, he could serve up to a year in prison.Jury selection also began on Thursday to pick the six jurors and two alternates who will decide the case. Majors, dressed in a dark gray double-breasted suit, entered the courtroom holding the hand of his girlfriend, actress Meagan Good, and carrying a Bible.He stood, clasped his hands and bowed his head toward the prospective jurors as the judge introduced him.At least one potential juror signaled she recognized Majors -- known for his roles in the ""Ant-Man"" films, as well as starring in the Disney+ TV show, ""Loki.""A number of other potential jurors said they had heard about the allegations and had already made up their mind.Several women said they had seen a video of Jabbari dancing two hours after the assault claim against Majors. A few of them told the judge they could not put the images out of their minds and render a verdict based solely on the evidence.""We need to know that you can be fair and impartial jurors,"" Gaffey said.One woman said she knew nothing about the case but told the judge she had been the victim of domestic violence and did not think she could be fair.Majors appeared to listen intently and look each prospective juror in the eye as they spoke about what they had seen, heard or read.The judge read out the multiple counts of assault and aggravated harassment Majors faces.""These are just allegations against Mr. Majors. He has denied these charges,"" Gaffey said.Gaffey scheduled opening arguments for Monday. Prospective jurors were told the trial is expected to last about two weeks.",3927,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jonathan-majors-domestic-violence-trial/story?id=105274784,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,aggravate lack strike michael listen unfortunate image misdemeanor press twist grace ripped prosecutorial chaudhry review dispute role make seth forward year merit clasped back carefully attorney assistant part priya include eye ultimately prevents statement spoke evidence slap serve impartial violence hour woman kramer count neck officer quid dance enter bow parcel kelli argument prosecute hand decide pro preclude mind marvel call deny city read move claimed camera associate claim allege heard october ear knew vehicle actress recognize zuckerman verdict arrest actor signal monday accuser girlfriend thursday accuse office evaluate action jury minor opening number domestic bring selection receive gaffey cut expect arm judge meagan perpetrator criminal schedule night hospital footage gray assault connection jonathan victim galaway intently allegation york begin stem convict quo potential tv base conclude fair manhattan told film police hold carry file solely put charge loki plead guilty district harassment dark injury fail introduce discuss complaint argue major authority show head account video law benefit subsequently pick defense respond render case incident treat juror week courtroom star jabbari trial dress multiple body recent suit alleges fact alternate prospective march day stood properly coat push,-0.99035,0.0,10.626369958275385,0.3427014042867701,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Meta sues FTC to block tough new restrictions on kids’ data,2023-11-30 12:39:00,Brian Fung,"Instagram-parent Meta has sued the Federal Trade Commission in an attempt to prevent regulators from reopening the company’s landmark $5 billion privacy settlement from 2020 and and from banning the social media giant from monetizing the user data of children.Thursday’s lawsuit in Washington federal court calls for a halt to the FTC’s proceeding, arguing that it is an unconstitutional abuse of government power.Meta argues in the complaint that the FTC has acted as both prosecutor and judge in an “obvious power grab … resulting in an unconstitutional adjudication by fiat.”The suit marks an escalation by Meta after a federal judge in the same court ruled on Monday that the FTC proceeding could move forward. Meta appealed that decision on Tuesday, but Thursday’s lawsuit expands the company’s pushback further. The FTC declined to comment on the new suit.After alleging new violations of Meta’s 2020 consent order, the FTC proposed in May to expand the terms of the company’s settlement to include significant new restrictions barring it from monetizing the personal data of users under age 18. The agency also called for new limitations on Meta’s use of facial recognition, as well as a moratorium on new products and services from the company unless a third-party audit can prove it is complying with its privacy obligations.If approved, the restrictions could significantly limit Meta’s data-driven business, particularly as it seeks to court younger users and to grow in new product areas, such as virtual reality.Meta’s lawsuit also reflects the latest in a series of legal attacks on the authority of independent federal agencies, power that is increasingly under scrutiny by the nation’s highest courts and may be curtailed by the Supreme Court.",1759,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/tech/meta-sues-ftc-restrictions-kids-data/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,consent rule company billion ftc lawsuit judge adjudication nation high data social seek curtail bar unconstitutional significant expands attempt reopen argues limit escalation increasingly violation recognition forward act commission medium result monetize comment halt series order include washington age power supreme government expand late virtual mark landmark proceed abuse young business propose appeal ban prosecutor reflect complaint court argue call comply obvious pushback personal agency move product decline authority facial giant user moratorium settlement privacy allege tuesday restriction service meta term significantly grow decision particularly legal prevent independent monday attack suit prove regulator thursday area federal approve limitation trade audit grab scrutiny,-0.32225,0.0,11.297413249211356,0.4194214876033056,0,2023-11-30

CNN,A little bar in Northern Ireland has won hearts across the world with its moving holiday commercial,2023-11-30 12:26:00,Issy Ronald,"Christmas commercials have become a staple of the holiday season for many retail giants, from Disney to British department store John Lewis, with morals and miniature stories often contained within them.But one little bar in Northern Ireland, Charlie’s Bar, has eclipsed them all this year, producing a heart-warming commercial that has gone viral, as social media users praised its “beautiful message” and “poignant” storyline.The video, posted Friday on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, depicts an old man laying flowers at his wife’s grave before walking down the streets of Enniskillen, attempting to greet strangers - who take no notice of him.He enters a bar, where he sits alone until he is approached by a friendly little dog, shortly followed by the dog’s young owners, and they all enjoy a festive drink together.The video, which is just over two minutes long, finishes with a quote often attributed to the poet W.B. Yeats: “There are no strangers here, only friends you haven’t yet met.”“There’s often a lot of loneliness at Christmas time…and so the story was about kindness,” Aoife Teague, a content creator who filmed and edited the commercial, told CNN.“It was about spreading love and being aware that there are people out there who are on their own at Christmas time that don’t find it a magical time of the year and find it quite lonely … It’s about being a friend and the dog sort of represents a person making the first move to go over to speak to somebody and the impact that can make to their day.”Charlie’s Bar has served the residents of Enniskillen, a small town in Northern Ireland about 80 miles southwest of the capital, Belfast, since 1944 and has stayed in the same family for that time.Its manager, Una Burns, worked closely with Teague to produce the commercial. Teague said Burns and a friend came up with the storyline after encountering several customers who were lonely and came to the bar in search of company.Then, after the three of them storyboarded the commercial “basically on a piece of paper, it wasn’t … the professional way,” Teague filmed it over the course of three hours.The four stars of the commercial are all local residents, Teague said, explaining that “the couple were Una’s friends who just happened to have a lovely dog,” Missy, and Martin McManus, who plays the old man, performs in local community theater.As of Thursday, the video had accumulated 1.2 million views on TikTok alone since it was posted on Friday evening, as well as more than 147,000 likes on Facebook, a response that Teague says still “hasn’t really sunk in.”And its impact stretched beyond social media, she added, with people from all around the world, including Canada, the United States and Germany, sending messages “saying either they relate to the video or the video means an awful lot to them.”“There’s also been … even strangers who have rung up the bar and donated money towards someone who might be coming into the bar this Christmas on their own to just buy them a drink or offer them a chat,” she said.“I think this video has really impacted people in ways that we’d hoped but in some ways that we never imagined, either.”",3161,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/travel/charlies-bar-northern-ireland-viral-christmas-commercial-intl-scli/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story post storyboarded spread customer social friendly eclipse capital finish united make enjoy burn year greet canada medium john buy chat represent paper include small minute viral lovely million basically facebook retail accumulate serve martin time instagram festive walk lonely teague edit hop course find imagine long belfast message family enters community move drink love impact mile resident aware encounter street approach search thursday happen quote stranger view donate flower poignant yeats money sits couple manager produce bar lay attempt mcmanus contain depicts state holiday notice piece charlie relate stretch christmas northern person sort southwest send offer season work enniskillen add british told shortly town attribute commercial film missy friday beautiful young ireland closely friend staple tiktok creator storyline aoife lewis praise world sunk giant video kindness user store loneliness follow germany play lot grave miniature disney rung poet local star stayed wife explain response department content professional awful owner magical speak performs,0.95935,0.2847200253084466,8.206760563380278,0.3757275132275132,0,2023-11-30

Washington Post,"John Nichols, literary chronicler of small-town New Mexico, dies at 83",2023-11-30 10:44:00,Harrison Smith,"John Nichols, who launched his literary career in his mid-20s with a pair of tragicomic novels but became best known for evoking New Mexico’s small towns and rural landscapes in books including “The Milagro Beanfield War,” was found dead Nov. 27 at his home in Taos, N.M. He was 83.His daughter, Tania Harris, said he died Sunday night or Monday morning because of his long-running heart problems, which included atrial fibrillation. He had likened his heart to a “ticking time bomb,” she said, but had refused to move out of the dusty, beaten-down home where he had lived alone for years, maintaining a nocturnal schedule in which he wrote from 10 p.m. until 6 in the morning.Mr. Nichols, a self-effacing novelist with a penchant for dark humor, liked to say that most of his two-dozen books were “wildly unsuccessful.” But a few earned him a cult following and a reputation as a leading chronicler of New Mexico, his adoptive home state, where he wrote with humor and pathos about the land and its people, including the tension between White developers and Chicano and Indigenous communities fighting to retain their heritage and their homes.“He fell in love with the people, the air, the sky, the mountains. But he was keenly aware of the weight of history, and the historical inequity here among the Native peoples and the Spanish,” said Stephen Hull, the director of the University of New Mexico Press, which published nine of Mr. Nichols’s books.Mr. Nichols started his career in New York, where made a living out of college playing the guitar in Greenwich Village coffee shops and selling cartoons — “mostly of naked ladies,” in his telling. He was just 24 when he published his first book, “The Sterile Cuckoo” (1965), a coming-of-age story that began like this: “Several years ago, during the spring semester of my junior year in college, as an alternative to either deserting or marrying a girl, I signed a suicide pact with her.”The novel went on to recount the relationship between the narrator, a more or less conventional beer-guzzling student, and his eccentric girlfriend, Pookie Adams.Reviews were mixed — in the New York Times, Eliot Fremont-Smith wrote that it was filled with “adolescent jabbering” — but the novel became a commercial success with the help of a 1969 film adaptation that marked Alan J. Pakula’s directorial debut and featured an Oscar-nominated breakout performance by Liza Minnelli.By the time the film was released, Mr. Nichols had published another coming-of-age story, “The Wizard of Loneliness” (1966), about a precocious 11-year-old on the home front during World War II. (The book was adapted into a 1988 film.) He had also moved to Taos, where he worked for a muckraking alternative newspaper called the New Mexico Review, reporting on land and water issues in the state’s rural north.His reporting provided the inspiration for “The Milagro Beanfield War” (1974), a comic novel about a Latino community’s efforts to prevent its town from being transformed into an upscale vacation resort.“At the time, that book seemed like my last shot at a literary career,” Mr. Nichols wrote in an autobiographical essay. He was broke after spending a few years unsuccessfully trying to publish a political novel, inspired by his burgeoning opposition to capitalism and the Vietnam War. His frustrations faded after he wrote a first draft of “Milagro” in five weeks, but his excitement about the novel’s commercial prospects turned into disappointment when the book turned out to be “a dismal failure,” he told the Santa Fe New Mexican. “It got reviewed, but it disappeared.”Critics found “Milagro” overwritten and clichéd. Gradually, it found an audience of readers who admired its dark humor, underdog plot and evocative descriptions of a fictional New Mexico backwater. A 1988 film adaptation, directed by Robert Redford, drew further attention to the book, which inspired the names of a Milagro bed-and-breakfast and Milagro art gallery in Taos.The film, which starred Rubén Blades as a friendly sheriff and Christopher Walken as a menacing lawman, was filmed in nearby Truchas, from a screenplay that Mr. Nichols co-wrote with David Ward. Mr. Nichols said he came around to the production after failing to prevent Redford from getting involved, explaining in a 2022 memoir, “I Got Mine: Confessions of a Midlist Writer”: “I didn’t want a famous blond, blue-eyed Anglo actor directing the film of a book written by another blond, blue-eyed gringo, a novel in which half the characters spoke Spanish.”Mr. Nichols wrote two sequels, “The Magic Journey” (1978) and “The Nirvana Blues” (1981), in what he called his New Mexico Trilogy. But he came to consider “Milagro” “an albatross around my neck,” lamenting that readers seemed more keen on reading another one of his comic novels than in engaging with his later work, which often focused on politics and the environment.Interviewed by the Los Angeles Times in 1994, he said he had been politicized by a trip to Guatemala three decades earlier, when he encountered widespread poverty and became critical of U.S. involvement abroad. He later protested the Vietnam War by demonstrating outside the Pentagon, traveled to Nicaragua to see the effects of the country’s left-wing revolution and published a bleak and violent antiwar novel, “American Blood” (1987).Mr. Nichols also dabbled in screenwriting, doing an uncredited rewrite of “Missing” (1982), a Costa-Gavras thriller based on the case of the American writer and filmmaker Charles Horman, who was murdered in Chile days after the 1973 U.S.-backed coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The film starred Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek and received four Oscar nominations, winning for best adapted screenplay.“The ‘real’ Hollywood has remained a mostly unknown foreign country to me,” Mr. Nichols wrote in his memoir, looking back on other assignments, uncredited or unrealized, for directors including Costa-Gavras and Ridley Scott. “I existed on its very fringe, picking up crumbs that fell off the table. … I once explained it like this: ‘I never jumped over the moon, but, when nobody was looking, I did run away with the spoon.’”John Treadwell Nichols was born in Berkeley, Calif., on July 23, 1940. He had the same name as his paternal grandfather, a naturalist who was the curator of fishes at the American Museum of Natural History, and spent childhood summers at his grandparents’ 18th-century estate in Mastic, N.Y., on the South Shore of Long Island.His mother, Monique Robert, was French, a granddaughter of the poet Anatole Le Braz. Like Mr. Nichols, she was plagued by heart problems; she died at 27, when he was 2. He later memorialized her in one of his nonfiction books, “Goodbye, Monique: Requiem for a Brief Marriage” (2019). His father, David, married three more times and taught psychology at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.Mr. Nichols graduated from the Loomis boarding school in Connecticut, where he captained the hockey team and wrote gangster stories in his spare time, imitating Damon Runyon. By the time he enrolled at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., he was writing “at least one novel a year,” by his count.“Occasionally, a brave professor would be kind enough to read my stuff, then offer encouraging words as he or she politely vomited behind my back.”Mr. Nichols received a bachelor’s degree in English in 1962 and spent a year in Barcelona, where he began writing “The Sterile Cuckoo” while teaching English. He settled in Taos in 1969, during a period of personal and artistic upheaval.“For some reason, the East had overwhelmed me. … But in New Mexico, my relationships soon cut through class lines and occupations,” he wrote in “If Mountains Die: A New Mexico Memoir” (1979).His marriages to Ruth Harding, Juanita Wolf and Miel Castagna ended in divorce.

CNN,"A year after ChatGPT’s release, the AI revolution is just beginning",2023-11-30 10:32:00,Catherine Thorbecke,"ChatGPT may not be able to perform a cake smash on its first birthday today, but it certainly managed to wow the world and create a mess of hope, hype, fear and chaos through nearly all parts of the economy in the past year.Its parent company narrowly survived a dramatic board coup, a CEO ouster and executive musical chairs turbulence on the eve of its one-year anniversary as some of its leaders reportedly feuded over the potential consequences of the powerful technology they had created. Wednesday, the company announced Sam Altman is officially back as CEO.One year out, here is how ChatGPT has changed our lives and what could come next.Rewind to this time in 2022 and you see the technology industry reeling from unprecedented mass layoffs and cost-cutting measures that put legions of people out of work and shattered myths about Silicon Valley’s dominance. After an early pandemic rally, Big Tech companies’ stocks plummeted in 2022, shedding billions in market value. At the same time, higher interest rates all but evaporated funding for startups, and a cloud of uncertainty hung over the tech sector that led some to draw parallels to the dotcom bust more than two decades prior.And then, on Nov. 30, a startup called OpenAI released an experimental chatbot dubbed ChatGPT.Seemingly overnight, the user-friendly generative AI technology enraptured the globe. It wowed the public with its ability to carry human-sounding conversations, draft emails and essays and respond to complex search queries with succinct outputs. In just two months, ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, estimated to have reached 100 million active users by January. It spurred an AI arms race among companies that buoyed the bruised tech sector. It fostered a bidding war for top AI talent. It also promised to revolutionize the future of white-collar work — so long as it didn’t cause an AI apocalypse in the process.And one year since ChatGPT’s public release, the fervor around AI is still at a fever pitch. Tech giants have poured billions into the technology. Nations are hoarding the chips required for future AI ambitions. And the promises and pitfalls of generative AI are still hotly debated around board rooms and dinner tables across the globe.“It really wasn’t until ChatGPT was put into the hands of people and they could use it themselves, at scale, that the world woke up to the AI revolution and what is happening,” Jeff Clune, a computer science professor at the University of British Columbia and a former research manager at OpenAI, told CNN of ChatGPT’s biggest impact one year out.Clune pointed to how ChatGPT has already made millions of peoples’ lives easier in small and unique ways — such as by helping a non-native English speaker write a cover letter for a job application or aiding a person with specific dietary restrictions in creating a meal plan — but he adds that the tool’s underlying technology’s full effect on society hasn’t even begun to peak.“Many people incorrectly focus on the current, seemingly magical capabilities of AI, without properly looking at the rate of improvement over time. Things continue to get better exponentially,” Clune told CNN. “The stuff that AI can do now is just the beginning.”ChatGPT’s impact on society, so far, has been marked by an outsized amount of hype and a learning curve in real-world implementation.Schools and educators continue scrambling to figure out how best to use the technology that can both be a personal tutor for every child but also write homework assignments and essays on behalf of students.The lives of artists and creatives have also been upended by the tool’s ability to churn out content, both in written form and via image-generating tools like OpenAI’s Dall-E. The powerful new crop of tools has already posed a real threat to the livelihoods of working artists, who are now racing to find ways to protect their work from being pulled into datasets used to train AI tools.And AI’s long-prophesied impacts to the labor market is also beginning to emerge, both inside and outside the tech industry.One study in August found that within just months of ChatGPT’s release, it was already negatively impacting employment opportunities and earnings for online freelancers such as copywriters and graphic designers. It seemed to have the largest impact on the most-skilled freelancers, or the people who did the most jobs and saw the highest earnings.A separate study published in September, meanwhile, found that giving highly skilled white-collar workers at a major consulting firm access to ChatGPT’s latest system could improve workers’ performance by some 40%.Many of the tech world’s most prominent figures have spent the past year waxing poetic about how AI has the potential to boost productivity, help us all work less and create new and better jobs in the future. But as is often the case in tech, the long-term impact isn’t always the same across industries and markets. And the road to a techno-utopia is often bumpy and plagued with unintended consequences. Some workers have anecdotally said that the rise of AI has actually led to a mountain of new headaches in their jobs. And even outside of the workplace, it has been impossible for most people to avoid other unintended consequences of this technology — such as the deluge of AI-generated content that has flooded the internet over the past year.Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor at Brown University who helped co-author the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, told CNN that at this point, we are all still collectively in the phase of trying to figure out what AI tools like ChatGPT can actually be used for and what their limitations are.“This has always been a tendency in AI, or whenever any new piece of tech comes along, that ‘This is the answer that will solve everything’,” Venkatasubramanian told CNN.“It’s too soon to know whether it’s lived up to the hype,” he added, while still calling some of the claims from the AI industry about its potential to solve major world problems “nonsense.”But for better or worse, generative AI is “not going away” at this point, Venkatasubramanian said. “And the hard work will continue to be done even once the hype moves on.”Some of the hard work will ultimately entail imagining new ways that generative AI tools can have the most equitable impact on society and not worsen the divide between the haves and have-nots.“Many, many, many jobs that are currently done by humans, AI will be able to do,” said Clune, the AI researcher at the University of British Columbia. “How does society adapt to that?”“It could go really well or it could go really terribly,” he added, pointing to dueling future world visions where AI tools doing work could either lead to humans having more time to spend with their families and on things they are passionate about –— or a world in which “only the very wealthy few are getting all the money, and we’re not doing anything to provide meaning for people who have lost the ability to get paid.”“The transition is going to be challenging,” he said, and now is the time for the public to put pressure on policymakers and the industry to come up with creative solutions. This could mean taxing AI companies and redistributing those funds or increasing experiments in universal basic income, Clune noted.OpenAI itself, the makers of ChatGPT, publicly states that its mission is to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” And for most of the year OpenAI executives toured the globe to meet with world leaders, regulators and the public to answer questions and seemingly promote this goal.But then came the pre-Thanksgiving blowup. During a whirlwind five days that unfolded just last week, OpenAI saw its CEO Sam Altman ousted and reinstated to the helm of the company in a vertiginous saga like something from a movie.The reasons given for Altman’s initial departure were vague. The company said in a statement that the board concluded “he was not consistently candid in his communications,” but offered no further details — even as employees revolted over his exit and threatened to leave, en masse, as well. Sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events told CNN’s Kara Swisher that a factor in the CEO’s firing was tension between Altman favoring developing AI more aggressively and board members who wanted to move more cautiously. But OpenAI and Altman have yet to publicly share what actually went down.Less than five days after Altman’s ousting — which was marked by two interim CEOs being named for OpenAI and a very brief period where Altman said he was joining Microsoft — the company announced it struck a deal to bring him back as chief executive and that a new initial board had been formed.The company made the news official in a blogpost on Wednesday, the eve of ChatGPT’s one-year anniversary.“I have never been more excited about the future,” Altman wrote. “I am extremely grateful for everyone’s hard work in an unclear and unprecedented situation, and I believe our resilience and spirit set us apart in the industry. I feel so, so good about our probability of success for achieving our mission.”The turmoil, of course, raises fresh questions about how OpenAI can achieve its mission of benefitting all of humanity if the organization could barely keep itself together.",9396,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/tech/chatgpt-openai-revolution-one-year/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,shed point cloud news leader company chatgpt effect leave ceo nation wealthy draft pandemic draw excite announce solve tool revolution datasets inside worker rally candid officially back freelancer deal industry income query deluge revolutionize active skilled clune economy million rate change ultimately scramble late history statement negatively ambition promise form detail reason tutor time focus equitable plummet tax plan cnn stock train long big hand birthday provide mission ensure call executive move release cautiously pitch meet succinct feud society easy claim lose speaker essay plague organization artist grateful event search globe legion measure openai happen departure found fire write complex layoff question wednesday challenge market buoyed university workplace vision tech table chaos valley email policymakers seemingly billion anecdotally arm startup manager emerge capability interest terribly currently creative believe away graphic solution mountain parent bruise apocalypse require large knowledgeable brown begin protect dominance early oust raise potential microsoft benefitting conclude official house masse hung overnight told survive research crop output bidding online give coup eve child live spend productivity phase former vague meal cake room fever improvement answer blueprint january unintended application giant musical uncertainty user professor adapt decade restriction upended churn success avoid barely white resilience mess ouster value chair basic join revolt chief hope september content unclear reportedly designer interim reinstate top situation educator worsen saga bumpy improve duel divide threat source artificial separate promote technology computer curve race make rise real passionate year dietary feel fear researcher evaporate science tendency part incorrectly internet blowup small behalf altman homework firm employee narrowly earnings perform probability turbulence pull foster spirit hotly road unfolded letter system swisher today assignment course mass estimate unfold find consumer impossible imagine dubbed continue family threaten intelligence personal share tension impact ability current highly past experimental livelihood labor universal collectively set smash exit august sam spent regulator underlie learn wow wax generative english limitation unprecedented achieve full dotcom experiment initial poetic specific bring shatter sector month money prominent scale venkatasubramanian aggressively high vertiginous fresh pressure redistribute board future silicon performance funding marked transition state bill debate parallel hard piece humanity fervor person offer extremely employment work outsized life add pitfall job maker figure powerful consequence bust helm chip british period conversation communication cover publicly pose unique carry enrapture put boost flood columbia exponentially tour woke general factor reach aid stuff opportunity world amount major publish hoard public lead creatives myth member access meaning whirlwind benefit spur hype dinner develop struck problem respond case anniversary wowed turmoil headache week favor jeff consult chatbot talent magical dramatic increase human study day create consistently properly reel manage copywriter entail blogpost fund,0.9971,0.2873563218390804,9.915022727272724,0.4448647575446137,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,The killings that made mass murder an American obsession,2023-11-30 10:30:00,not specified,"In film, TV and song, murderous crime sprees often carry a manic joy, jacked-up Bonnies and Clydes hammering along the highway, reveling in transgressive freedom. Sick, a little bit crazy, yeah, but there’s still something enviable in that dopamine orgy. “At least for a little while, sir, me and her we had us some fun,” is the way Bruce Springsteen puts it in the title song of his 1982 album, “Nebraska,” which recounts the eight-day killing rampage by Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate, in Nebraska in 1958.Harry N. MacLean’s “Starkweather: The Untold Story of the Killing Spree That Changed America” slams the brakes on the romance. In his relentless, methodical investigation of the murders, there’s not one iota of fun anywhere, beyond the satisfaction of reading his surgical, spare writing. In MacLean’s telling, the week that Starkweather — and Fugate, according to the conventional narrative — shot, stabbed and mutilated 10 people, including most of Fugate’s family, was singularly joyless: aimless days watching TV, scrounging for bad food, driving back and forth down desolate roads, sleeping in cars and getting stuck in muddy ditches, interspersed with bursts of horrific and random violence amid the frozen Nebraska winter. The exact details of that week — who did what, when — matter, and what has been long portrayed as a straightforward rampage, with Fugate as gung-ho accomplice, changes and shifts as MacLean repeatedly stops the story and starts it again, over and over, each time with new details that cancel previous, official versions.Poor Charlie Starkweather, though, at least at first. Growing up in Lincoln in the 1950s, he was bowlegged and myopic, a flaming red-haired runt topping out at 5-foot-5, the butt of jokes and relentless bullying. Which is no excuse, of course. By the time he was a 19-year-old garbage collector sporting a leather jacket and dangling cigarette, he was a sociopath with a hair trigger and a waiflike 14-year-old girlfriend. Chicken or egg applies here — he’d already killed a gas station attendant weeks prior, a crime for which the police had no leads — but when Fugate broke up with him one Sunday afternoon, Starkweather’s “days as a garbage man were over,” writes MacLean. “His days of fighting with his fists were over. He needed a gun.” Two days later, upon his return to Fugate’s house, she allegedly watched as he shot her stepfather in the head, shot her mother in the mouth, repeatedly stabbed them and crushed their skulls with the rifle butt, and stabbed 2-year-old Betty Jean in the throat. He and Fugate cleaned the blood, as the conventional story goes, and then spent the next five days sitting on the sofa, watching the tube, the bodies of her parents and sister stuffed in various places outside.You get the idea.Their luck ran out in Wyoming, after eight days of more of the same, with Fugate at various times supposedly toting a .410 shotgun and doing some of the killing herself. She was the most “trigger-happy person I ever seen,” Starkweather said in one of many confessions. They were famous, their rampage “kick[ing] off a blaze of storytelling far beyond what he, or anyone else for that matter, could ever have imagined,” including 12 books, one major film (Terrence Malick’s “Badlands”), three documentaries, one TV miniseries and numerous mentions in song, including by Springsteen and Billy Joel. After separate trials, Starkweather died in the electric chair in 1959 and Fugate got life.So why yet another book about this horrific mess? Because Fugate was innocent, which MacLean’s dogged reporting goes further than any previous account in proving. When state troopers finally caught up to them, Fugate fled from Starkweather, leaped into a trooper’s car, said Charlie was going to kill her and asked if her family was okay. Within hours of hearing that her family was dead, the eighth-grader underwent a series of lengthy interrogations over multiple days while heavily drugged by prison authorities, without an attorney present. There were neither witnesses nor physical evidence directly linking her to any of the killings. She became the youngest girl in the United States to stand trial for first-degree murder: a 14-year-old child, herself a victim of parental abuse, in the company of an armed and violent adult man, who said she feared for her life throughout his rampage. Starkweather’s fantasy from the beginning, MacLean compellingly argues, was to die in a blaze of glory and to take his love with him so they could be forever together, preferably with Fugate perched on his lap. His increasingly detailed confessions — in one he asserted that Fugate had killed six all by herself — combined with inconsistencies in her long interrogations and, among other details, the fact that she’d had sex with Starkweather during the rampage ultimately led to her conviction. But as MacLean, a former trial attorney, shows, she cannot have been culpable. That she was present for her family’s murders doesn’t hold up, for one thing; she was in school when Starkweather killed them and stashed the bodies. Even at the time, the case against her was so weak that she was tried in only two of the killings, and as an accomplice.“Starkweather” is a story about a different time in a different America. “Fugate was never evaluated by a psychologist or psychiatrist,” MacLean writes, “or even interviewed by a social worker or counselor prior to her trial.” There was little understanding of abuse and its effects in this era, long before Patty Hearst or Elizabeth Smart, who, like Fugate, had numerous opportunities to escape their captors but never did.Television, MacLean argues, created a new kind of American celebrity, “the first modern day mass killer.” Starkweather’s arrest and trial were carried daily on prime-time national TV for 18 months straight. “The world had never seen anything like it,” he writes, describing it as the “beginning of the love affair between television and violent crime,” in which a disaffected nobody could pick up a gun and become “a somebody.” It was TV that rendered Fugate guilty in the minds of every watcher, long before her trial, and it was TV that created a new American cultural disease: mass killings. Starkweather’s was the only mass murder in 1958, a fact that seems almost quaint now, considering that, by MacLean’s tally, “from 2006 through 2020, there was a total of 448 mass killings, involving 567 offenders, 2,357 victims killed, and 1,693 injured.”It is a grim statistic in a grim story, and that grimness is the paradoxical joy of reading MacLean — the raw chill creeping through your veins that feels authentic to the place and the crimes, the lean and vivid sentences rivaling Capote’s “In Cold Blood” and Mailer’s “The Executioner’s Song.” Here, though, there’s an exception that differentiates this book from those earlier ones. In “Starkweather,” something good does finally happen when Fugate gets paroled in 1976, after serving 18 years, at the age of 33, the beginning of a long and normal life that included marriage and work as a nanny. Justice is served, but so is redemption, a moment that feels like the first cloudless day after an exceptionally grueling, bitter, high-plains winter.Carl Hoffman is the author of five books, including “Liar’s Circus,” “The Last Wild Men of Borneo” and “Savage Harvest.”The Untold Story of the Killing Spree That Changed AmericaBy Harry N.

Washington Post,Anthony Bourdain always wanted to punch Henry Kissinger over Cambodia,2023-11-30 10:23:00,Timothy Bella,"“Henry Kissinger and a penguin walk into a bar …”Anthony Bourdain had a joke for his guests while filming an episode of “Parts Unknown” in Indonesia. When the subject turned to the United States supporting the decades-long dictatorship of Indonesian President Suharto, who had the support of Kissinger when he was secretary of state, Bourdain loved the punchline in a joke that was more desire than jest. The punchline packed a literal punch.“I’m not asking what you’d do, but would it displease you if I walked over and punched Henry Kissinger in the face? Would you find that entertaining?” he said in a 2018 episode that aired months after Bourdain, 61, died by suicide. “Would you feel that justice is, in some small way, served?”When one of the men joining him at the bar said that Bourdain despised Kissinger — something the celebrity chef and travel documentarian regularly mentioned — Bourdain didn’t deny his disdain for the American diplomat.“I hate him, yeah,” Bourdain said on “Parts Unknown,” using a four-letter word that was edited out on the broadcast. “Because in my travels, I’ve stumbled upon his good works everywhere I go.”But perhaps no issue involving Kissinger irked Bourdain more than the 1969 “secret bombing” of neutral Cambodia and the American ground invasion of that country the following year. The bombing and invasion ended up expanding the conflict in Southeast Asia and led to a takeover of the country by the murderous Khmer Rouge.“Once you’ve been to Cambodia, you’ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands,” Bourdain wrote in “A Cook’s Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines,” his 2001 memoir.More than five years after Bourdain’s death, many on social media have resurfaced his comments after Kissinger died Wednesday at the age of 100.Kissinger wielded unparalleled power over U.S. foreign policy throughout the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald Ford, and Kissinger remains the only person ever to be White House national security adviser and secretary of state at the same time. He faced relentless blowback from critics who deemed him amoral and unprincipled for his foreign policy, namely the efforts in Vietnam and Cambodia that left countless dead and maimed. Kissinger and Ford also gave Indonesia’s Suharto the go-ahead for an invasion of East Timor that resulted in about 200,000 deaths, or roughly a quarter of the Timorese population.In Cambodia, the airstrikes on the neutral country and the subsequent ground invasion by U.S. troops stirred fury across the United States and prompted the resignations of some of Kissinger’s most accomplished staff members. But Kissinger was unapologetic, arguing that Cambodia’s neutrality was first violated by North Vietnam and that the United States had no obligation to allow Hanoi to use Cambodia as a sanctuary for attacks on Americans.Bourdain traveled to more than 80 countries during his run as one of the world’s most recognizable celebrity chefs, and he spent considerable time in Southeast Asia for his TV show. In his best-selling memoir, Bourdain reflected on the effect Kissinger’s foreign policy had on Cambodia.“Witness what Henry did in Cambodia — the fruits of his genius for statesmanship — and you will never understand why he’s not sitting in the dock at The Hague next to [Slobodan] Milosevic,” wrote Bourdain, referencing the former Yugoslav and Serbian leader who was on trial for war crimes before he died in prison in 2006. “While Henry continues to nibble nori rolls and remaki at A-list parties, Cambodia, the neutral nation he secretly and illegally bombed, invaded, undermined and then threw to the dogs, is still trying to raise itself up on its one remaining leg.”Kissinger never publicly acknowledged Bourdain’s criticism, but his name came up again in a 2017 New Yorker profile, in which Bourdain pushed back on the idea that his show leaning into more political and social issues made him a celebrity statesman. He joked that he wouldn’t be attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner because “I don’t need to be laughing it up with Henry Kissinger.” He then criticized any journalist who had ever been polite to Kissinger.“I’m a big believer in moral gray areas, but when it comes to that guy, in my view he should not be able to eat at a restaurant in New York,” Bourdain told the magazine.When journalist Patrick Radden Keefe mentioned how Bourdain had buried the hatchet and had dinner with many people he had previously denounced, including Emeril Lagasse, Bourdain again referenced Kissinger.“Emeril didn’t bomb Cambodia!” Bourdain exclaimed.In early 2018, Bourdain was in Indonesia for CNN’s “Parts Unknown” when he mentioned how the West was culpable for the atrocities that unfolded decades earlier. Bourdain concluded that he would deliver a rabbit punch to Kissinger, and laughed about it before taking a shot with the group.Months before his death, Bourdain shared the passage from his memoir criticizing Kissinger over Cambodia. Bourdain had regrets, he admitted — but none of them related to his thoughts on Kissinger.“Frequently, I’ve come to regret things I’ve said,” Bourdain wrote on Twitter, now X. “This, from 2001, is not one of those times.”",5252,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/11/30/henry-kissinger-anthony-bourdain-cambodia/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,run leader amoral asia episode effect nation indonesia punchline penguin social acknowledge laugh regularly administration shot henry fury united unparalleled american hanoi subsequent make year undermined roll regret back feel medium result chef celebrity dead witness part turn unapologetic packed include small violate extreme conflict punch ground political north power justice expand prompt cook threw serve beat neutral anthony remain quarter time walk nixon mention edit emeril unfolded reference admit bombed radden invade cnn atrocity invasion timor find murderous despise secretly restaurant hand big reflect involve illegally continue nori entertain security resignation joked deny share previously love considerable cuisine literal indonesian correspondent secret richard denounce cambodia profile serbian memoir yugoslav issue gerald resurface hate bombing attack idea deem spent slobodan wield view write x wednesday culpable disdain neutrality month suharto desire secretary left east subject foreign guest suicide blowback remaki rabbit bar fruit guy gray stop kissinger party obligation passage attend sanctuary patrick policy country vietnam broadcast southeast west adviser state remains crime effort keefe comment york statesmanship genius relentless president understand takeover airstrikes global person polite raise early related national work age unprincipled tv critic conclude house travel told irk adventure yorker publicly film roughly recognizable give death khmer tour milosevic former prison countless statesman bourdain joke criticism dock word argue twitter world bury lead journalist show member accomplish maim follow unknown decade criticize dinner nibble eat stumble ford earlier white believer deliver jest join trial stir air frequently hague area troop hatchet staff lean bomb documentarian support displease timorese dictatorship push lagasse,-0.99005,0.4569687738004568,9.451042701092348,0.3445284202976511,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,"Shane MacGowan, brilliant but troubled Pogues frontman, dies at 65",2023-11-30 10:12:00,Brian Murphy,"Shane MacGowan, a songwriter and singer who channeled an Irish brand of defiance and vulnerability as frontman of the Celtic punk band the Pogues in the 1980s but whose own addictions drove him from the group at its height, died Nov. 30 at 65.His wife, journalist Victoria Mary Clarke, announced his death on Instagram and gave no other details. Mr. MacGowan was hospitalized with viral encephalitis last year and spent months in intensive care.He was widely credited with helping create a distinct blend of the raw power of rock and punk with the lilting rhythms of Gaelic folk melodies, inspiring bands such as the Cranberries in Ireland and the Dropkick Murphys in Boston. In his songwriting, Mr. MacGowan often drew from Irish literature, mythology and strains of nationalism from Ireland’s centuries-old conflicts with Britain.His goal, he said in a 1983 interview, was music that “had roots” but also “more real anger and emotion.” Part of that tableau was tapping into the history of struggle and discrimination in the Irish immigrant experience, particularly among the large Irish community in Britain.“I was ashamed I didn’t have the guts to join the IRA,” he said in a 2020 documentary, “Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan,” referring to the Irish Republican Army and its battles against British rule in Northern Ireland. “The Pogues was my way of overcoming that.”Mr. MacGowan first found his inspiration in London’s punk scene in the 1970s as bands such as the Clash and the Sex Pistols brought their rebellious assault. After cycling through punk bands, he formed the Pogues in the early 1980s, becoming its chief songwriter and polestar.“His defiant, drunken truculence quickly made him an idol to legions of Irish, nearly Irish, and wannabe Irish,” music journalist Stephen Lemons wrote in Salon in 2001.The Pogues rose from London pub gigs to playing major arenas by the late 1980s. A 1987 holiday-themed lament, “Fairytale of New York,” became one of the band’s most popular songs — with Mr. MacGowan and Kirsty MacColl in a duet, swapping stories of melancholy, broken dreams and drinking. (Christmas was also Mr. MacGowan’s birthday.)Mr. MacGowan begins:It was Christmas Eve, babeIn the drunk tankAn old man said to me, won’t see another oneThe band’s fifth album, “Hell’s Ditch” in 1990, was its last with Mr. MacGowan. He had been missing gigs and rehearsals as his alcohol abuse deepened. His health was in steep decline from complications of hepatitis, but he reportedly refused physicians’ orders to stop drinking. The band voted to kick out Mr. MacGowan in 1991 after he failed to show for shows during a tour in Japan.“Joining the Pogues was one of the best things that ever happened to me, and leaving them was one of the best things that ever happened to me,” he told the Daily Telegraph in 1997. “By the end of it, I hated every second of it. They’d moved so far away from what we were doing in the first place. I didn’t like what we were playing any more. I refused to knuckle under and become professional. They were all becoming professionals and growing huge egos.”Mr. MacGowan later formed the band Shane MacGowan and the Popes, which recorded two studio albums. He rejoined the Pogues for a reunion concert in 2001.Shane Patrick Lysaght MacGowan was born near Tunbridge Wells, England, on Dec. 25, 1957. His parents were Irish immigrants working in Britain and returned to Tipperary, Ireland, when Mr. MacGowan was young.His father played the accordion and concertina, and Mr. MacGowan was performing publicly at 3 after a family audition. “They put me up on the kitchen table to sing and the song went down very well,” he told the Guardian.Mr. MacGowan married longtime girlfriend Clarke in 2018. In addition to his wife, survivors include his father and a sister.Reflecting on his career, Mr. MacGowan once described the Pogues as a “bar band. We play music for people to dance to, to fall in love to, to groove to, to have a few drinks to, to cry a little over, and to get a little sentimental over.’”",4052,https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/11/30/shane-macgowan-pogues-dies/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story tableau dropkick widely leave sex idol channel announce health survivor truculence make reunion rise pogues brand real literature year accordion fairytale dream songwriting nationalism part melody order include cycling celtic singer conflict viral quickly battle power boston credit intensive perform late drinking drunk history mr alcohol form drew huge detail gold kitchen ashamed steep sentimental goal instagram victoria defiant lilt london interview dance duet rock hell gaelic audition family onethe rhythm community concert addition salon murphy drunken move band love music drink married hospitalize kick lemon macgowan particularly blend wannabe immigrant irish drove gut legion sing spent girlfriend height happen found studio write punk scene strain fall cry record father table vulnerability knuckle discrimination anger rule month clarke britain played rebellious tunbridge army bar pope groove swap rehearsal republican brought stop inspiration concertina assault patrick away lament parent addiction documentary large place york daily ira begin christmas northern kirsty struggle clash early popular hepatitis england work refuse longtime defiance complication british told publicly babein vote crock born song abuse give put ireland death eve ditch experience tour maccoll miss overcome stephen fail refer distinct tipperary major journalist decline show frontman return telegraph mythology encephalitis inspire play described round arena cranberry melancholy career grow folk pub physician rejoin join broken group chief songwriter tap pistol deepen wife lysaght reportedly professional album raw mary create tankan gig root shane,-0.9791,0.0740375123395854,7.786666666666662,0.3634147536491287,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,The meatloaf of my dreams uses a surprising ingredient,2023-11-30 10:00:00,Ellie Krieger,"This is my “official” meatloaf recipe, a meaningful designation considering the many variations on the dish I have come up with over the years. Rising above the rest, this is the one I make again and again, the one everyone in my family hopes for when they request meatloaf for dinner. It offers all the homey, familiar, comfort-food appeal you expect, in a way that is refreshingly different and considerably more healthful than a typical recipe, thanks to a few strategic ingredient swaps and additions.One big difference is the type of meat I use: venison. I started using ground venison one year after my bowhunter husband brought some home, and I was immediately won over by how the lean, rich-tasting meat enhanced the dish. Since then, if venison was unavailable, I used ground bison, which has similar attributes and can be easier to find. Lean ground beef or turkey (I prefer a mix of dark and white meat) works here as well. The key is to use lean meat, as the recipe is designed to be moist and flavorful without relying on beef fat for the job.Get the recipe: Venison Mushroom MeatloafSautéed mushrooms, finely diced so they meld with the ground meat, bring ample moisture, extra savory flavor, and a layer of vegetable nutrition to the mix, as does some finely grated carrot. And quick-cooking oats, a fiber-rich whole grain, instead of the usual breadcrumbs, lock in moisture as they help bind the ingredients together. The oats disappear into the meatloaf as it cooks, so you’d never know they are there.I season it with layers of savory flavor — onion, garlic, thyme, tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce, each compounding one another — and top with a mustard- and molasses-kissed tomato sauce, which caramelizes to a gorgeous glaze in the oven. It comes out deeply tasty, meaty and tender, yet also lighter than a typical meatloaf, without a trace of greasiness. It’s “officially” the meatloaf of my dreams, made real.",1936,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/11/30/meatloaf-best-venison-mushrooms-healthy/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bring carrot vegetable tomato ingredient expect caramelizes oven instead extra onion type husband swap brought rise make rely fat oat real year difference garlic similar dice typical officially venison trace dream worcestershire grain lighter meld bind offer work season ground official design request meatloafsautéed familiar layer cook mushroom attribute usual compound savory disappear bowhunter home gorgeous meaningful meatloaf finely appeal dark recipe find start consider big grate paste tender family deeply flavor rest meaty different ample breadcrumb refreshingly dish lock unavailable moisture greasiness easy homey sauce dinner flavorful bison mix meat nutrition beef tasty white glaze turkey strategic hope prefer moist considerably key designation lean thyme variation healthful top immediately enhance,0.94665,0.1549586776859504,8.036657963446473,0.39,0,2023-11-30
CNN,"Shane MacGowan, lead singer of The Pogues, dead at 65",2023-11-30 09:56:00,Jack Guy,"Shane MacGowan, the lead singer of Anglo-Irish band The Pogues, has died, according to a statement from his wife, Victoria Mary Clarke.Clarke announced the death of the 65-year-old on Instagram, saying: “There’s no way to describe the loss that I am feeling and the longing for just one more of his smiles that lit up my world.”He died on Thursday after a prolonged period of ill health, according to social media posts by Clarke.The singer had been discharged from Dublin’s St. Vincent’s Hospital on November 22 after receiving treatment there for an infection, Clarke said.She had provided regular updates about MacGowan’s health while he was in hospital, thanking followers for their “lovely messages and prayers.”MacGowan had grappled with multiple health issues in recent years and used a wheelchair since breaking his pelvis in 2015.Last year, he was diagnosed with viral encephalitis, a potentially life-threatening condition that causes an inflammation of the brain.And MacGowan received a full set of dental implants in 2015 after losing several teeth as a result of his heavy drug and alcohol use.Born in Kent, England in 1957 to Irish parents, MacGowan spent his summers in a farmhouse in southern Ireland, surrounded by traditional Irish music.He formed his band, The Pogues, in London in 1982 with Peter “Spider” Stacy, Jem Finer and James Fearnley, blending traditional Irish folk music with punk sounds.The Pogues went on to release a string of successful albums and singles, the best known being the 1988 Christmas hit “Fairytale of New York,” in which he duetted with English singer Kirsty MacColl.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, was one of the first to pay tribute to the musician. In a post on X on Thursday he wrote that MacGowan’s “songs beautifully captured the Irish experience, especially the experience of being Irish abroad.”Irish President Michael D. Higgins also commended MacGowan’s rich body of work, saying in a statement that he “will be remembered as one of music’s greatest lyricists.”“His words have connected Irish people all over the globe to their culture and history, encompassing so many human emotions in the most poetic of ways,” said Higgins.",2193,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/entertainment/shane-macgowan-death-scli-intl/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,potentially kent michael receive longing lit post clarke heavy social traditional loss announce hospital health rich pelvis pogues higgins great year wheelchair parent fairytale feel medium result smile york treatment president connect surround christmas finer kirsty string spider lovely viral singer england work follower stacy history statement period hit alcohol form musician instagram song especially update ireland infection death victoria minister experience london inflammation dublin discharge regular james prime blending describe accord message provide teeth word jem remember lead band release music varadkar poetic leo november grapple vincent lose encephalitis duetted farmhouse successful summer diagnose southern emotion single prolong macgowan folk issue encompass set irish capture multiple wife body globe recent implant culture commend spent thursday album pay beautifully human mary dental english condition write x punk full fearnley shane tribute break,0.85955,0.4103967168262653,10.373592233009706,0.398041958041958,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Opinion: What the Sports Illustrated AI debacle is telling us,2023-11-30 09:39:00,not specified,"During my downtime, I like to take a break and play a baseball simulation game called Out of the Park Baseball, or OOTP. I would happily bore you for hours explaining this game, but in lieu of that, I will simply say that you construct a roster of MLB players and then play it against other teams in simulations. At the end of each game, OOTP produces a box score and statistics, but it also adds a feature that always tickles me: It writes up a game story.Technically, the details of that writeup are true. But of course none of it actually happened, no actual baseball was played and no human was hired to write a story about it. The “game story” is entirely AI-generated. And you know what? It’s fine. If you asked me, a professional sports writer for nearly two decades, to write a three-paragraph story on these simulated games, it might look similar. Though I’d like to think I’d get better quotes.The point is: The conventions of sports writing—the who, what, when, where and how—are so established at this point that they are unusually easy to emulate by a robot, to the point that a silly baseball simulation game can, in certain contexts, do it as well as I can. Which is why it wasn’t particularly surprising to learn this week, in a fantastic scoop from Futurism, that Sports Illustrated has been running fake, AI-generated articles—“written” by non-existent humans with AI-generated images and bios—for months now.The magazine—it’s probably not accurate to call Sports Illustrated a “magazine” at this point after the draconian cuts that have been made to its staff, but I’m honestly not sure what else to call it—immediately deleted the articles when Futurism called attention to them, which, as a human writer, I can confirm upsets the author a lot less when the author is a robot. The blowback has been overwhelming, from a full-on (human) staff revolt to an industry-wide lament of just what the once-revered institution, one that once published William Faulkner, Robert Frost and John Steinbeck, had become. How could Sports Illustrated have come to this?After Futurism published its report, a spokesperson for The Arena Group, which has owned and operated Sports Illustrated since 2019, told CNN that the now-deleted articles were created by a third-party company. “We have learned that AdVon had writers use a pen or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy — actions we don’t condone — and we are removing the content while our internal investigation continues and have since ended the partnership,” the spokesperson said. AdVon did not respond to CNN requests for comment.It shouldn’t be that surprising that Sports Illustrated has found itself under fire; the publication’s struggles under owner The Arena Group (formerly Maven) have been well-documented. There are still many terrific journalists there, from young stars like Richard Johnson to Emma Baccellieri to established vets like Pat Forde and Tom Verducci, but all you’ve had to do is visit SI.com at any time in the last three years to see how much the journalistic experience has degraded, taken over by fansites, branding exercises (Sports Illustrated the resort!) and the regular detritus you expect to find on almost any corporate website these days. If you are just now gnashing your teeth about what has happened to Sports Illustrated since you read the magazine as a kid, you are getting on this bus very, very late. (Full disclosure: I briefly hosted a television show for Sports Illustrated a few years back that no one watched.)It’s hardly the first once-respected sports website to fall prey to the desperation of AI-generated content: The site I founded, Deadspin, has restarted its AI program, and while it’s thoroughly depressing to see my pride and joy turned into a robot content farm, I have to confess I’m not sure the human writers over there are faring much better. But the only difference between those sports sites using AI writers and other sports sites using AI writers is that people actually used to enjoy Sports Illustrated and Deadspin; Yahoo, for example, has been contracted with a company called “Automated Insights” to write AI sport stories for years. It doesn’t seem like that many people have noticed, or really cared if they did.And I think there’s even something existential about the profession here. The other big sports media controversy of recent weeks involved Fox and Amazon sideline reporter Charissa Thompson (whom I’ve also worked with, it’s a small industry, people) confessing on a podcast that she, when she couldn’t track down a coach at halftime for an in-game quote, would “make up the report sometimes.”Many smart sideline reporters, including Hall of Famer Andrea Kremer, blasted Thompson for the obviously unethical behavior (for which she apologized, saying she “chose the wrong words to describe the situation” ). But it is worth noting that despite Thompson working as a sideline reporter for eight years, not once did anyone notice that she might have been making up stories even though she had one of the most high-profile jobs in the profession.Thompson herself said she could get away with it because, as The New York Times put it, “no coach would object to her citing boilerplate comments about the team’s performance.” That’s pretty damning right there, isn’t it? Making up reporting is bad, obviously. But what does it say about the reporting in the first place that Thompson’s (self-alleged) made-up stories were indistinguishable from the empty prattle she usually got out of coaches?Usually when journalists make up stories, they do so to make them more interesting (and of course, the vast majority of journalists do nothing of the sort). But Thompson knew not to do that, because if she would have made them interesting, they would have sounded fake. Because she—and so many other sideline reporters—so rarely gave us anything worthwhile. Her deception was a sad, empty cracked-mirror image of what she was giving us anyway. If sports journalists can’t give us anything that isn’t obviously different than something made up specifically to be boring and anodyne, well, how much better are we than the robots anyway?Another game I like to play in my downtime is NBA2K, the wildly popular NBA video game. At halftime of every game I play, the (virtual) announcer throws it down courtside to an XBOX avatar of Curt Gowdy Award-winning reporter David Aldridge, who, in real life, is a fantastic journalist whom NBA fans have known and respected for years. But in the game, Aldridge is not real; he’s just some pixels synced to audio the real Aldridge recorded years ago.The last time I played, Video Aldridge asked Video Julius Randle, who had 16 first-half points for my Video Knicks, what the key to his performance in the first half was. Video Julius Randle (also synced to audio the real Randle recorded years ago) answered in empty platitudes, because how could he not? He’s not real. He’s describing a game that didn’t happen. The whole interview is made-up, because the game is made-up.And you know what? I get just as much insight from a NBA2K courtside interview as I do from a real one. They sound exactly the same. Is it any wonder Thompson wouldn’t bother with an actual interview? A robot literally does it just as well.So as much as I was saddened by Sports Illustrated’s AI debacle, not to mention what’s happening at my old site, I still find myself less offended by the robots than I am despairing at the quality of the work they’re ostensibly replacing. Sports writers insist, as we fight back against a creeping AI world, that we can always do our jobs better than a robot can. If we’d like to continue working in this industry and having the trust and eyeballs of our readers and viewers … I’d humbly suggest we work a little harder to make sure we can prove it.",7848,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/opinions/sports-illustrated-ai-controversy-leitch/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story point insight run wildly company host delete image program andrea restart confess accurate vet hire halftime pixel frost worthwhile make real enjoy illustrate year difference reporter existential draconian back vast sadden viewer feature medium industry context john forde humbly william turn include small debacle site request late thompson boilerplate virtual baseball johnson famer team detail hour time desperation writer formerly mention insist fox wrong spokesperson joy fine game interview course website trust cnn bother emma find describe automate degrade blast big involve behavior continue deception reader yahoo contract call baccellieri downtime honestly pride read wonder actual curt simply author pat faulkner report sideline richard score easy privacy coach amazon writes convention silly entirely knew avatar partnership throw probably particularly sync controversy object profession sport depress empty learn happen quote found fire deadspin action statistic write exercise park note full suggest majority fall record break unusually roster worth month cut expect gowdy fantastic blowback upset produce played interest fake publication smart robert platitude track replace reporting away anodyne kremer performance similar lament advon construct ootp notice pen harder unethical place york comment eyeball fare boring magazine specifically lieu sort protect struggle terrific popular work sad randle announcer life add job verducci operate sound investigation knicks corporate respect ago told offend kid pseudo podcast despite box ostensibly condone young give put futurism experience attention regular remove briefly scoop despair nba happily pretty half teeth literally word bore world visit branding journalistic steinbeck publish prattle journalist answer audio show farm different chose mlb video simulation overwhelm tom play decade lot robot writeup institution quality courtside aldridge respond apologize resort disclosure arena player week fansites charissa establish star julius revolt group tickle prey explain simulated detritus maven david content recent key television prove professional indistinguishable confirm owner internal surprising fight bus human day create staff article emulate hall xbox situation creep damn rarely gnash watch,0.852,0.0382262996941896,8.027589743589743,0.4439019165736721,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Travis Kelce has this nickname for Taylor Swift,2023-11-30 09:32:00,Lisa Respers France,"Welcome to the land of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce coupledom.As people continue to obsess over the two stars and their whirlwind romance, Kelce has offered a bit more insight into their relationship on his podcast.The NFL tight end and his older brother, fellow NFL player Jason Kelce, drop new episodes of their “New Heights” podcast every Wednesday. This week the younger Kelce revealed his nickname for Swift, thanks to his big brother.Jason Kelce, who plays center for the Philadelphia Eagles, hailed his younger brother for a career milestone achieved during Travis Kelce’s game on Sunday: becoming the fastest tight end to achieve 11,000 receiving yards in the league and the only one to do it in the history of his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.The elder Kelce noted that Swift showed support by “liking” a Kansas City Chiefs post about the achievement.“Alright now. Thanks, Tay,” Travis Kelce said. “I appreciate you on the Chiefs’ page supporting.”A moment as we all sigh together at the adorableness.His older brother had to tease him a bit, asking if Swift has always been a fan of tight end receiving yards.“I’m not sure if that’s a good question,” Travis Kelce said, smiling. “Maybe.

CNN,Pirelli calendar 2024: Idris Elba and Angela Bassett headline ‘Timeless’ show of Black excellence,2023-11-30 09:03:00,Tom Page,"The 50th edition of the famed Pirelli calendar has been released, with its customary glamour and pizzazz, and with a few fresh faces ready for their close up.Trailed for months and featuring a roster of Black talent, from actors to sports stars to royalty, the project was overseen by 28-year-old Ghanaian Prince Gyasi, the first Black and first African photographer to shoot the calendar in its long and storied history.Headlined by Idris Elba, Angela Bassett and Pirelli habitué Naomi Campbell, as well as the notable inclusion of Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, king of Ghana’s Asante people, it marks a bold and colorful departure for the once-risqué calendar.Gyasi, one of the youngest photographers to receive the nod by Pirelli, told CNN in a recent interview he still feels like a child at heart. You can see that playfulness in his photography.Elba is stranded on a pontoon surrounded by suitcases; former France footballer Marcel Desailly prepares to leap out of starting blocks wearing a retro reporter’s radio; poet Amanda Gorman and writer Margot Lee Shetterly prepare a lecture on power. Some of their faces may look serious, but the photographer’s compositions are anything but.Nevertheless, Gyasi said that he’s all business on set. “I’m an artist who knows what I want from the get-go. It’s not like I’m going in (to a shoot) like, ‘yeah we’re going to mix it up,’” he said.“My sets and stages and costumes are planned for months. So the person (I’m shooting) gets it right. All these people (in my photos) are the characters. So if you come on my set, you do what I say.”The Ghanaian, who kickstarted his photography career using an iPhone on the streets of Accra at age 16, has experienced a meteoric rise in recent years, creating campaigns for Puma and Balmain, with work adorning the pages of Vanity Fair and GQ.The theme of his Pirelli calendar, “Timeless,” is taken literally at points (see: Naomi Campbell standing in front of a giant, Dali-esque clock), but Gyasi said it infused the project in other ways.“The best definition of ‘timeless’ is something that stands the test of time — and that is still quality,” he explained. “For me, it was to create something that if I look at it in 20 years, that I still love it … That it doesn’t look dated, right?”His distinctive use of saturated block color — a feature inspired by the photographer’s synaesthesia, which causes him to associate words with colors — is on display throughout the Pirelli calendar, from backdrops to costumes. Gyasi has previously said he wants his audience to question whether they’re seeing a painting or a photograph, and he keeps things suitably uncanny here. “There’s a thin line between surrealism and reality — and that bridge is Prince,” he said.Despite becoming a poster boy for a new generation of photographers, one senses Gyasi could take or leave the profession. “I studied fine art and sculpture,” he told CNN. Both Gyasi’s parents are musicians, as was his late grandfather. Today he has many musician friends who continue to inspire him, he said.“People will ask me, ‘Why did you pick up a camera?’” said Gyasi. “I picked up a camera because where I come from, it wasn’t really considered a respectable tool.

Washington Post,Ask Sahaj: I never told my child about their autism diagnosis. Should I now?,2023-11-30 09:00:00,Sahaj Kaur Kohli,"Dear Sahaj: Our adult child is married and may be thinking about starting a family. About a year after they were born, they started showing signs of autism. I recognized the signs myself having done a master’s in child development.At that time, pediatricians weren’t well-versed in spectrum behaviors. Luckily, I was aware of Stanley Greenspan’s “Floor Time” and that sensory issues could be addressed with occupational therapy. To make a long story short, we made good progress, and by kindergarten had a diagnosis and appropriate ongoing treatment.Our child now has a PhD and is teaching at a university. I don’t think our child knew of the autism spectrum diagnosis. They knew of the OCD diagnosis and have continued medication for that. They have grown out of the more autistic aspects. They’re extremely personable and sociable.My dilemma: Should I talk to the couple (both professors) about our child’s early diagnosis and give them a heads-up about possibly needing to parent a child on the spectrum? Not to scare them but to prepare them? How much information should I share about the issues we had to address?I know it’s important to pass down medical information to offspring. But I don’t know how to have this discussion. Looking back, I can see similarities with my brother and my father. But talking about autism rather than heart disease or cancer seems so different and more difficult. Any advice would be most welcome. Thank you.— Conflicted ParentConflicted Parent: Regardless of how adaptable your child is, or whether they are considering having kids, you’re right that they deserve to have access and transparency around their medical information.Autism looks different for everyone, and it’s a spectrum. You may feel like your child has “grown out of” their diagnosis, but there may be other ways — that you’re not aware of — that your child experiences the world and their relationships differently than their non-autistic peers.Having a diagnosis and their past medical information may help them continue to receive support or understand their own behaviors, thoughts and feelings more fully. Additionally, many autistic folks consider autism to be a part of their identity; that’s something your child should be able to embrace for themself.Have this conversation in person, or at the very least over a video call if you’re not physically close. I suggest talking to your child alone; let them decide when and how to share this with their partner.Be direct and honest during this conversation. This may sound like: “I have something to tell you and wish I had told you sooner. When you were X years old, you were diagnosed with autism. You received occupational therapy, and since you seemed to adapt pretty well, I didn’t think it was worth discussing over the years. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner, and I am here to answer any questions you may have.”While you may feel motivated to “prepare them” as future parents, don’t focus on that. Instead, focus on your intention of simply being honest with your child about their medical information. There’s no way to predict how they will respond. They may be upset that you didn’t tell them earlier or even shocked. Be mindful of giving them time and space to process this information.If they do ask why you didn’t share it sooner, you can be truthful about what your fears were, but be sure not to get defensive about your decision. Take responsibility for not having shared this earlier, and let them guide the conversation after you share the diagnosis. This will help you know what and when to share. Simply: Whatever their questions are, be completely honest in answering them.Talking about autism feels different and more difficult than talking about cancer or heart disease likely because of the messaging around the diagnosis that you are still unlearning. It’s not your fault; there were many misconceptions about what it means to be autistic that have been embraced by society and are still being challenged today.You want to be radically honest with yourself about your own biases and worries — so as to not project these onto your child or into this conversation.",4150,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/11/30/ask-sahaj-disclose-child-autism-diagnosis/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story bias information project teach adult ongoing make sign important occupational year unlearn back advice feel fear master part appropriate wish conflict close parentconflicted sooner phd grown stanley autism spectrum intention time dilemma focus sensory start differently long decide fault behavior continue message family brother call address fully motivate share autistic simply married direct society radically misconception medical aware past knew recognize diagnose identity decision welcome issue pediatrician sahaj diagnosis continued feeling talk question x suggest greenspan space university father physically worth kindergarten responsibility additionally predict receive couple defensive truthful instead upset difficult sorry future parent scare understand worry person discussion extremely early relationship personable challenged sound therapy conversation prepare adaptable told kid embrace born give child experience ocd shock honest dear pretty consider discuss world mindful answer similarity show transparency different access video professor aspect adapt cancer respond possibly short progress folk disease offspring earlier guide luckily completely heart process deserve support floor medication,0.9031,0.144578313253012,8.28064436183395,0.5099841269841269,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,Rare lobster found in Maine is two sexes and two colors,2023-11-30 08:05:00,Sydney Page,"A rare dual-color and dual-sex lobster has become a curiosity and a sensation since being captured this month off the coast of Maine.Internet fans have named the two-toned crustacean “Bowie,” after the late rocker David Bowie who famously blurred gender lines and had two different eye colors.Jacob Knowles, a Maine lobsterman, said he was fascinated after his friend caught Bowie in mid-November, and he began featuring the unusual lobster in videos on his Instagram and TikTok accounts, which together have more than 3 million followers.“This is the coolest lobster I’ve ever seen,” Knowles, 30, said in the first video he shared of Bowie. “Never seen one like it; never heard of one like it.”People were immediately intrigued.The colorful crustacean is split 50-50 from head to tail into halves of red and bright blue.According to the University of Maine’s Lobster Institute, split-color lobsters are about one in 50 million. These two-toned lobsters are often also gynandromorphs — an organism that has male and female characteristics — with one color displaying male traits and the other displaying female traits.Bowie’s two sexes and two colors are genetic anomalies caused by embryo mutations.“They can both occur separately or together,” explained Alex Ascher, a marine biologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Mass. “They’re two separate conditions that are both rare.”Despite Bowie’s multicolored shell, if the crustacean were to be cooked, “it would turn red like any other lobster,” said Ascher, explaining that lobsters (and other crustaceans) have a pigment called astaxanthin in their shells, which reacts to heat.American lobsters, in general, are a range of colors — including shades of blue, green, brown, orange and red. A lobster’s color is determined by genetics and nutrition.In Bowie’s case, the blue side is male, and the red side is female, Knowles said, noting that the size and stiffness of the upper swimmerets — which are abdominal limbs on crustaceans — are one indication of sex.“That’s the most obvious,” Knowles said.The tail, he said, is another indicator. While a female’s tail will flare out on the bottom to hold eggs, a male’s will taper in.“You can clearly see that one side of the tail is a female and the other side is a male,” said Knowles, who is a fifth-generation lobsterman, and has been fishing since he was seven.A few years ago, Knowles started sharing on social media snippets of his life and work. To his delight, people were captivated.“The lobster industry in general is very old-fashioned and has overall had a pretty low presence on social media,” he said. “I think I was just able to make a connection with people.”When he called out to his followers, asking for name suggestions for the lobster, people promptly delivered.Although Knowles’s personal favorite was “50 Percent” — a nod to the rapper 50 Cent — TikTok users preferred someone’s idea to call the crustacean “Bowie.”“There were a few good ones in there,” Knowles said of the name suggestions.Scientists have also taken note of the rare find.“This is the third one I’ve heard about in maybe the last 15 to 20 years or so,” said Christopher Tudge, a biology professor at American University who has been studying crustaceans for three decades.“Nature is full of exceptions and weird stuff like this,” Tudge said, adding that Bowie’s condition is “still exceedingly rare.”Knowles initially kept Bowie in a temporary cage in the ocean, but after a recent storm, he decided to move the crustacean to a large tank in his garage “to make sure the lobster stays alive,” he said. “It’s almost like a pet lobster at this point.”“Our plan now is to keep watching it and see if it can develop eggs,” Knowles said.Scientists say that’s highly unlikely — if not impossible.“With this lobster, I don’t see functionally how it would be capable of self-fertilization,” Ascher said.Female lobster eggs are fertilized when a male lobster pierces a female lobster’s abdomen and deposits his sperm, Ascher said. The female can then carry the sperm for up to two years, and she decides when to fertilize her eggs using the sperm.Bowie’s eggs could, in theory, get fertilized with the help of another lobster, but even if that were to happen, Bowie would likely still shed those eggs.“It might be possible, but it is very unlikely for a gynandromorph to successfully reproduce,” Ascher said.Still, Knowles is excited to see what Bowie’s future holds. He said he plans to eventually place the lobster at an aquarium or back in the wild.And, of course, he will continue to chronicle the lobster’s tale online, so fans can stay in the loop.",4654,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/11/30/lobster-maine-gender-color-bowie/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,shed pierce hole social trait sex separate possible excite nature color american make caught year back feature fishing green medium industry egg lobsterman characteristic orange sensation coast turn eye include initially chronicle million bottom presence display late follower loop christopher swimmeret instagram fertilize course snippet plan mass tail rare start male shell decide abdomen tudge continue alex limb ocean call institute multicolored side personal share rapper move gender promptly weird suggestion deposit genetic heard female highly bowie rocker split organism prefer idea happen lobster capable size embryo note full exception abdominal university colorful indicator month red fascinate tank reacts sperm functionally percent cooked astaxanthin future coolest connection occur knowles eventually anomaly range large place oceanographic brown begin determine curiosity delight reproduce flare work biology life stiffness decides add separately garage ago unusual hold carry online despite upper blur friend tiktok general cage stuff pigment falmouth pretty storm half successfully taper obvious genetics stay low head account different video user professor theory temporary aquarium institution develop ascher crustacean case biologist cent favorite line capture alive bright explain marine david indication famously recent nod wood exceedingly study blue condition shade immediately watch gynandromorph,0.98215,0.1933820369574559,8.244221748400854,0.3973080223080222,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Meta identifies Chinese propaganda threat ahead of 2024 election,2023-11-30 08:01:00,Sean Lyngaas,"Meta took down thousands of Facebook accounts based in China that were impersonating Americans while posting on partisan issues like abortion and health care, the tech giant said Thursday while warning that “foreign threat actors are attempting to reach audiences” online ahead of the 2024 US election.The fake Facebook accounts were mimicking, word for word, social media posts from Republicans such as presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Democrats such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Meta did not attribute the network of fake Facebook accounts to a particular entity in China.It’s the latest in a series of warnings from tech firms documenting how Chinese propaganda and influence operations have more aggressively targeted American audiences in the last year. And it comes as US officials are bracing for a tumultuous and divisive presidential election in 2024 in which a large swath of the electorate may question the results and foreign powers — such as China, Russia and Iran — could try to influence voters and sow doubt about the voting process.The report comes as US national security officials have suspended their work to flag potential foreign influence operations to social media platforms amid a legal challenge to that work from Republican attorneys general. Meta executives confirmed that US government agencies haven’t shared information with the platform related to foreign election interference since July, when Republicans brought the legal challenge. The US Supreme Court plans to take up the case.Before the court case, “there are a number of times when a tip from government has enabled us to take action … quickly” against covert foreign influence operations, Nathaniel Gleicher, Meta’s head of security policy, told reporters.It wasn’t clear, Meta said in a report on foreign online threats published Thursday, what the Chinese network of fake accounts was trying to accomplish. The tech giant said it took the network down before it got any engagement from real people on Meta’s apps.“This is the most notable change in the threat landscape compared with 2020,” Ben Nimmo, Meta’s global threat intelligence lead, told reporters on Wednesday, referring to an increase in Chinese online influence operations in the last year aimed at audience around the world.Russia’s sweeping attempt to interfere in the 2016 US elections showcased how trolls and bots can be used to amplify divisions among Americans. China has traditionally shied away from such direct and divisive interference tactics, according to analysis and US officials. But there are some signs that may be starting to change ahead of next year’s election.Suspected Chinese operatives have also used images made by artificial intelligence-generated images of the Statue of Liberty and the Black Lives Matter movement in an attempt to spread disinformation, Microsoft analysts said in September report.The Chinese government also has built up the world’s largest known online disinformation operation and is using it to harass US residents, politicians, and businesses — at times threatening its targets with violence, a recent CNN review of court documents and public disclosures by social media companies has found.China routinely denies that troll farms operate from its soil.“Some people and institutions have launched one ‘rumor campaign’ after another against China on social media platforms and spread a tremendous amount of disinformation about China,” said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, in a statement when CNN requested a comment.While Meta and other tech firms tout their work to protect elections, recent moves by the company also show trends in the other direction.Several members of Meta’s team that countered mis- and disinformation in the 2022 US midterms have been laid off, CNN reported in July. And Meta this month said it would allow political ads on its platforms to question the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election.",3994,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/tech/meta-chinese-propaganda-us-democracy-2024-election/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,flag company outcome sow information image threat post spread artificial liberty social health american review chinese make florida real sign ron disinformation year reporter matter clear politician medium result attorney voting desantis analysis bot analyst troll abortion platform political quickly firm interference interfere power facebook change government request late warning influence statement routinely amid nimmo laid team violence election time tactic spokesperson nathaniel plan operation cnn embassy start accord security harass court threaten divisive intelligence shy executive agency gleicher move share statue report voter direct tremendous speaker resident swath mimic aim china showcased actor issue impersonate document thursday iran democrat action question wednesday bracing challenge number meta tech month foreign aggressively network counter engagement fake attempt pengyu republican brought ahead away launch policy tip large campaign target series global protect washington audience national work microsoft potential related built base life official house supreme denies operate sweep candidate landscape told partisan attribute movement tout propaganda online rumor business trend traditionally general reach former covert division doubt refer july word world amount tumultuous publish public lead electorate nancy show head giant account farm member black accomplish institution case disclosure suspend russia liu midterm legal enable compare particular thousand september entity recent confirm warn increase amplify gov operative notable presidential,-0.70685,0.0751126690035052,12.690131004366812,0.3495647721454172,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,U.S. stops helping Big Tech spot foreign meddling amid GOP legal threats,2023-11-30 08:00:00,"Naomi Nix, Cat Zakrzewski","The U.S. federal government has stopped warning some social networks about foreign disinformation campaigns on their platforms, reversing a years-long approach to preventing Russia and other actors from interfering in American politics less than a year before the U.S. presidential elections, according to company officials.Meta no longer receives notifications of global influence campaigns from the Biden administration, halting a prolonged partnership between the federal government and the world’s largest social media company, senior security officials said Wednesday. Federal agencies have also stopped communicating about political disinformation with Pinterest, according to the company.The developments underscore the far-reaching impact of a conservative legal campaign against initiatives established to avoid a repeat of the 2016 election, when Russia manipulated social media in an attempt to sow chaos and swing the vote for Donald Trump.For months, researchers in government and academia have warned that a barrage of lawsuits, congressional demands and online attacks are having a chilling effect on programs intended to combat health and election misinformation. But the shift in communications about foreign meddling signals how ongoing litigation and Republican probes in Congress are unwinding efforts once viewed as critical to protecting U.S. national security interests.Ben Nimmo, chief of global threat intelligence for Meta, said government officials stopped communicating foreign election interference threats to the company in July.That month, a federal judge limited the Biden administration’s communications with tech platforms in response to a lawsuit alleging such coordination ran afoul of the First Amendment by encouraging companies to remove falsehoods about covid-19 and the 2020 election. The decision included an exemption allowing the government to communicate with the companies about national security threats, specifically foreign interference in elections. The case, Missouri v. Biden, is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has paused lower court restrictions while it reviews the matter.The litigation and political scrutiny have led to broad uncertainty among foreign policy officials about what communications with tech companies are appropriate, according to a former State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of legal risks.“If you start asking those people to second-guess every time they need to send an email or pick up the phone to do pretty standard work that we’ve asked them to do on our behalf … it’s going to make the government less functional,” the person said.The Justice Department, the FBI and the State Department declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.The shift erodes a partnership considered crucial to the integrity of elections around the world — just months before voters head to the polls in Taiwan, the European Union, India and the United States. Ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential race, foreign actors such as China and Russia have become more aggressive at trying to exacerbate political tensions in the United States, while advanced artificial intelligence allows bad actors to easily create convincing political propaganda.Sen. Mark R. Warner, the Democratic chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said “legal warfare by far-right actors” has led to a dire situation.“We are seeing a potential scenario where all the major improvements in identifying, threat-sharing, and public exposure of foreign malign influence activity targeting U.S. elections have been systematically undermined,” the senator from Virginia said in a statement.Social media companies have long communicated with law enforcement about threats of child pornography and terrorism, but they did not discuss the threat of Russian interference during the 2016 campaign. Amid revelations of that interference, the firms began meeting with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials responsible for protecting elections from foreign interference to share information about potential threats ahead of the 2018 midterms. Tech companies such as Meta, Google and Twitter, now known as X, have also routinely relied on warnings from civil society groups and outside researchers about disinformation threats on their platforms.“We believe that it’s important that we continue to build on the progress the defender community has made since 2016 and make sure that we work together to keep evolving our defenses against foreign interference,” Nimmo told reporters on a call.Missouri v. Biden — and a parallel investigation in Congress led by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) — has led to broad legal uncertainty about interactions between the federal government and the tech industry. Most of the allegations in the lawsuit focus on ways federal officials allegedly pressured social networks to remove misleading posts about coronavirus vaccines and elections.But Meta’s announcement suggests that the Biden administration is broadly pulling back from even routine communications with Silicon Valley.The federal judge’s July 4 ruling prohibited key agencies — including the State Department, the FBI and DHS — from urging companies to remove “protected free speech” from the platforms. However, Trump-appointed Judge Terry A. Doughty appeared to acknowledge concerns that the decision could dismantle election integrity initiatives, specifying that the restrictions did not apply to warning companies of national security threats or foreign attempts to influence elections. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling removed some of the restrictions, including communication with the State Department.“The fact that the government doesn’t have clear guidance creates this instinct to err on the side of caution and just not do anything lest they be seen as doing something problematic,” said Evelyn Douek, an assistant professor at Stanford Law School.The conservative legal strategy is an evolution in a years-long effort to prevent companies from allegedly suppressing GOP views online. In addition to the litigation, Republicans, led by Jordan, have used their control of the House of Representatives to demand documents and testimony about the tech companies’ interactions with the Biden administration and accuse the White House of illegally colluding with Silicon Valley.Jordan said in a statement Thursday that the federal government and tech industry’s efforts to combat disinformation have resulted in “the suppression of Americans’ voices.”“We will continue to protect Americans’ First Amendment rights and put a stop to the censorship industrial complex,” he said.During a Senate hearing in October, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said that they had overhauled their communications with the tech industry in the wake of the Missouri v. Biden litigation, following questioning from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).“We’re having some interaction with social media companies, but all of those interactions have changed fundamentally in the wake of the court’s ruling,” Wray said.Wray said the changes were made “out of an abundance of caution” to ensure the agency does not run afoul of any court rulings. Mayorkas said DHS no longer participates in periodic meetings with tech companies and other government agencies where they previously discussed the “threat environment that the homeland faced.”University academics and disinformation research groups are also in limbo. Many are seeking cheap legal representation to defend themselves against mounting cases and reevaluating their communication with industry and the public.“The trust and safety workers are gone. The relationships with external researchers is now gone,” said Anika Collier Navaroli, senior fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University and a former senior Twitter policy official. “And now this third piece of the actual information from the government is gone. … So we’re basically unprotected.”Nathaniel Gleicher, head of security policy at Meta, said that while the company has resources to detect coordinated attacks on its social networks, the government is often more adept at tracking campaigns that are organized off social media. Before the 2020 U.S. election, Meta dismantled three covert influence operations based in Russia, Mexico and Iran after receiving tips from law enforcement about their off-platform activity, according to Gleicher.“Our investigators might not know that a campaign is coming until the last minute,” he said. “If they are operating off of our platforms, there are a number of times when a tip from [the] government has enabled us to take action.”Influence operations from Russia, Iran and China continue to aim at U.S. domestic targets. Meta said Thursday that it dismantled a group of 4,789 Facebook accounts posing as Americans discussing politics in the United States, often criticizing both sides of the political aisle. Some of those accounts appeared to be copying and pasting content from X onto Facebook, including posts by elected officials. In some instances, the network amplified X owner Elon Musk’s tweets on his platform.The threat of such campaigns might only grow as the 2024 presidential campaign heats up. Meta warned that if the Russia-Ukraine war or U.S.-China relations become hot-button election issues, it expects foreign influence operations to target those debates, as well.Renée DiResta, a technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said the 2022 midterms showed that both political parties are vulnerable to these campaigns.“These operations are real, they are global, and they target all political parties and positions — this is not a partisan issue,” she said. “In the U.S. 2022 midterms, we saw Iran targeting the progressive left and China targeting both the left and the right to advance state interests.”Graham Brookie, vice president and senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, said China-based foreign influence campaigns have evolved to spread conspiracy theories or target leaders.“It’s not getting better,” Brookie said. “The cost of engaging in foreign influence activities, especially in online information environments, has not gone up for bad actors.”",10351,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/30/biden-foreign-disinformation-social-media-election-interference/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,unwind amendment pinterest company effect spread social conspiracy union rand demand review politics gop worker exacerbate important poll clear back digital medium result industry chill assistant halt appropriate google minute dire interfere facebook afoul justice change government influence announcement statement mayorkas routinely christopher nimmo evelyn systematically russian time abundance focus mislead investigator nathaniel democratic evolve trust notification paul long paste security court ensure exemption mexico operating community addition agency previously reverse copying forensic discus society external testimony donald pause october evolution ran aim partnership china probe terry actor issue encourage warner journalism repeat attack representation mount coordination thursday heat intend exposure enforcement complex question wednesday musk functional speech university domestic tech scrutiny douek chaos email longer vaccine european secretary foreign expect judge allegedly manager terrorism seek combat alejandro republican tweet cost stop believe rely policy suppress limbo communicate collude tip large effort civil campaign target comment allegation biden begin send protect relationship potential base official house virginia missouri brookie jordan director academia told standard mark prohibit research swing council vote online circuit collier child manipulate former appeal caution pretty build consider discuss doughty senate improvement twitter litigation head account uncertainty professor observatory follow theory integrity criticize restriction censorship avoid critical meddling progress prolong control white midterm establish prevent chair malign revelation enable defend group chief engage response diresta content ruling position owner federal warn lab india run strategy organize sow information activity environment threat program lawsuit post participates artificial acknowledge administration race health united american vice ongoing make center real disinformation year undermined reporter initiative anika technical industrial safety specify researcher instance routine resource internet atlantic coordinate include behalf platform political firm interference basically aggressive development request warning spoke amid scenario urge wake pull err election pornography especially underscore operation crucial start coronavirus vulnerable accord dhs continue illegally responsible apply intelligence side actual share gleicher tension impact hearing voter conservative allege stanford homeland periodic barrage decision signal approach advanced tow document shift meeting falsehood iran congress accuse academic view aisle x wray number meta free anonymity month broad problematic receive erodes left network elect receives easily pressure attempt graham track silicon party phone ahead fellow progressive misinformation limited state debate parallel piece broadly fundamentally president global specifically person national work reevaluate convincing supreme investigation identify warfare communication elon detect partisan adept pose put suggests relation columbia remove fbi committee covert dismantle suppression taiwan july world creates defender major interaction low public lead decline show cheap law representative pick defense overhaul respond case senior grow russia guidance navaroli legal concern advance congressional department key fact instinct senator create amplify condition presidential,-0.06385,0.0869481209544971,13.804800000000004,0.3083764665286405,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Unseen photographs shine a new light on ’90s icon Winona Ryder,2023-11-30 07:32:00,Leah Dolan,"In the 1980s and ’90s, Winona Ryder was a dark-haired waif against a sea of preppy blondes. Pale, brooding and enigmatic, Ryder cut her teeth starring in alternative, macabre films like “Beetlejuice” (1988), “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992), “Edward Scissorhands” (1990) and “Girl, Interrupted” (1999).Her grungy, gamine look made her a convincing on-screen outsider, but it was this singularity that captivated so many. Three decades on, the starlet’s off-beat allure has hardly waned. In fact, it might have grown.Now, a new photography book by Robert Rich, former Vice President of public relations for fashion designer Marc Jacobs’ eponymous label, reveals a softer, more intimate side to the ’90s icon. “I will always be her Shnookie and she will always be my Shnookums,” Rich write in the introduction to “Winona,” a nod to the pair’s 20-year-long friendship and the intimacy of the images.There’s a recurring backdrop in the many of the polaroid snaps: the crowded collage wall of Rich’s basement office at fashion designer Marc Jacobs’ headquarters on Mercer Street in Manhattan. Ryder is there again and again — in a purple plunging evening gown, in messy braids and a dance school tank top or in a pair of overalls and a woven sun hat.Cameos by stars ranging Grace Jones to Kate Moss are strikingly human. They are pictured kissing Ryder on the cheek, or with arms flung around one another in a tight embrace. The office was their off-duty clubhouse, says Rich, who documented his friendship with Ryder consistently.“I’ve always been a fan,” he told CNN in a video interview. “And I had just seen “Girl, Interrupted” when she came (into the Marc Jacobs store). That’s how we became friends. I just went up to her and started talking about it.”As the decades went on, Polaroids made way for front-facing camera phones. The images in the book span across years and mediums, from selfies taken by Ryder and Rich to paparazzi shots of the pair walking through SoHo.“I didn’t want to be in the book,” said Rich. “But Francesca Sorrenti (esteemed fashion photographer and creative director of the project) looked at the pictures with a fresh eye and said ‘There are a lot of books on people — let’s show the relationship.’”There are no captions or timestamps for any of the images featured in “Winona,” mainly because Rich, by his own admission, failed to make detailed notes.“I wish I had dated them,” he lamented. “But I would just take the Polaroids, put them in my back pocket and let them develop that way. I wasn’t sitting down (categorizing them). I just put them in shoe boxes under my desk, or hung them on the wall if there was a good one.

CNN,‘Pay any price.’ Alibaba’s Jack Ma urges reform as rival rattles e-commerce giant,2023-11-30 07:21:00,Michelle Toh,"Alibaba founder Jack Ma has called for “change” as the stellar performance of a competitor causes a stir at his e-commerce company.On Wednesday, the billionaire responded to a recent rally in the stock of PDD (PDD), the group behind Chinese online shopping giant Pinduoduo and US-based retail upstart Temu.PDD reported blockbuster third-quarter earnings Tuesday, smashing analyst expectations. Revenue soared 94% to 68.8 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) compared with the same period in the previous year, while operating profit surged 60% year-on-year to nearly $16.7 billion (about $2.3 billion).That has pushed up the company’s stock in New York dramatically, taking it 18% higher Tuesday and another 2% higher Wednesday.As a result, PDD’s market cap has soared to $188.3 billion, putting it just below Alibaba’s (BABA) $189.9 billion.Alibaba employees have taken notice. In a post on the company’s internal forum Wednesday, one staffer mentioned that PDD was closing in on the Hangzhou-based group, prompting Ma to weigh in, according to a person familiar with the matter.“Please give us more constructive comments and suggestions, especially innovative ideas. I believe that everyone in Alibaba today is watching and listening,” he wrote in a comment, according to the source.Ma went on to congratulate PDD on its recent strong performance, adding that “the era of AI e-commerce has just begun, and it is an opportunity and a challenge for everyone.”“I firmly believe that Alibaba will change,” he wrote. “Everyone has been awesome, but those who can reform for tomorrow and are willing to pay any price and sacrifice are respected. Back to our mission and vision, Alibaba people, come on!”Ma founded Alibaba in 1999. He stepped down as chairman of the company in 2019, about a year before landing in hot water with Chinese authorities for criticizing the country’s financial regulators and banks. Since then, the entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile while remaining an Alibaba shareholder.Alibaba’s shares have tumbled 15% so far this year as it battles concerns over a sweeping restructuring, a leadership shuffle and fierce competition.Meanwhile, PDD has enjoyed a bumper year. On Tuesday, chairman and co-CEO Chen Lei attributed its results in part to the recovery of the Chinese economy, which he said on an analyst call was “clearly felt” by the company.PDD, which was founded in 2015, has also recently attracted international attention for its launch of Temu, an affordable online superstore that has become hugely popular in markets such as the United States and Australia.

Washington Post,LinkedIn has AI to enhance profiles. It made some sound robotic.,2023-11-30 06:00:00,Danielle Abril,"If you’re one of the many users who struggle to tell your professional story on the job site LinkedIn, a built-in artificial intelligence tool may now offer some assistance. But whether using AI is worth your time may depend on how creative you want your profile to be.LinkedIn began rolling out a generative AI feature to select users this spring, powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, to help premium subscribers write headlines and “about” sections. Users can generate text summarizing what’s already in their profile and get spruced-up suggestions offered by the feature, which is highlighted with a gold button that says “write with AI.” The capability is available to all of LinkedIn’s millions of premium subscribers, and the company said it’s exploring expanding access in the future.Generative AI features have been making their way into services and products across industries ever since OpenAI made a big splash with its AI bot ChatGPT late last year. Since then, Microsoft, a big investor in OpenAI, Google and others have been debuting new generative AI features across their product lines. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, is joining the bunch with its latest rollout.The Help Desk tried this feature and talked to some users about their experience, and they generally had the same impression: Though the AI suggestions may help you get started, they are too cookie-cutter and sometimes not factually correct.“It just feels lifeless,” said Pete DeOlympio, marketing director at AI and data analytics consulting firm Cleartelligence in Newton, Mass. “And the [AI-generated] version I got is technically wrong.”LinkedIn says about 70 percent of users who try the AI feature apply the recommended suggestions — either as is or with a few tweaks. The company also said it recognizes AI sometimes gets things wrong, and it is working to reduce errors. It recommends that anyone who uses the tool review the suggestions for accuracy and edit if needed. If the AI-generated suggestions feel too robotic, users can tweak their original profile and then rerun the tool to get variations. The company is still working on improving tone.“Our AI powered suggestions … are personalized by members,” based on what’s on their profiles, said Laura Teclemariam, senior director of product at LinkedIn. “We believe [the suggestions] will get better over time.”LinkedIn also said it is testing and rolling out other new AI capabilities that allow users to see personalized summaries of their feeds, write posts and messages and better connect to jobs for which they might be a good fit. And it has been coupling AI-generated conversation-starters with member insights to publish what it calls “collaborative articles” on topics such as leadership, team building and other skills.After testing the profile feature at the Help Desk, a couple of key things stood out. First, users need to ensure their profile is filled out for the AI to accurately pull titles and background. Otherwise it will pull whatever is there, which may not be the most relevant items to highlight up top. Second, like most generative AI, the output might be a little wordy (the content was nearly doubled in one case) and a little generic — so consider editing.In one test, the headline offered multiple options but the about section only offered one. It also stripped out some items that may not necessarily pertain to a user’s professional journey but rather offer some insight to quirks or insights to their personality.DeOlympio said that the tool might be useful for people who need help drafting something for their profile, but said it introduced an error when it assumed he oversaw a team. It also felt too bland for his personality.Several other users agreed.“The AI stripped the hook I had,” said Morgan Short, St. Paul, Minn.-based director of content and web strategy at price-management software company Vendavo, adding that some suggestions also created redundancy. “It can’t show the narrative if you’re trying to create a brand that sets yourself apart.”Some of the content the AI generates seemingly blends commonalities of a person’s job title with what’s actually in their profile to create the result, said Donna Svei, an executive resume writer in Los Angeles. And it may not be great for optimizing your profile for career advancement or changes, she said. That’s because the AI may summarize the experience and titles you already have versus what you aim to become.“The first few words in your profile [like the headline] have more [search] weight than any other field,” she said, adding that the AI highlights only your current and previous roles. “But you need to use the title you want in your headline.”For Sangeeta Krishnan, senior analytics lead at pharmaceutical and biotech company Bayer, the problem was the AI doesn’t allow users to customize what they want to highlight based on what’s most important in their industry. And in her case, the AI highlighted old certifications at the bottom of her list rather than elevating the more relevant ones she lists first in her profile. She also wished she could dial up or down different tones.“Everyone’s style of writing is different,” she said. “Maybe you could ask it to make it more professional or make it more funny, but it only gives you one option.”But as more people turn to AI for content, more text may start sounding the same, several users said. Svei said her brain clicks off when she reads items written by AI because it tends to be written in a way that makes the content less interesting. Short sees a lot of value in both generative AI and LinkedIn, but she wouldn’t recommend it for enhancing your profile.",5671,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/30/linkedin-ai-write-profile/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story insight strategy company version improve deolympio chatgpt post artificial item data fill sangeeta certification double draft tool review investor role make brand important great assistance year hook roll feature feel result software industry explore turn bot robotic recognizes google funny wish versus reduce vendavo assume firm site million bottom power personalize change expand late team laura pull gold time writer technically edit wrong morgan style optimize mass premium highlight paul start big message apply angeles ensure intelligence call executive recommends read subscriber generally suggestion field wordy current click available service elevate profile aim dial blend web set search select impression error openai talk spring splash generative oversaw write section accuracy variation commonality headline summarize worth bland accurately seemingly strip quirk couple text capability krishnan feed interest percent recommend teclemariam collaborative creative believe relevant brain button option model donna connect begin weight person struggle offer original work microsoft base pertain add job marketing analytics factually building sound director topic felt bayer linkedin generate depend output lifeless pharmaceutical give necessarily experience biotech background introduce consider test desk list narrative word svei publish product lead show cleartelligence member different access user newton rerun previous lot journey problem case summary senior career short tweak generates value advancement line leadership join consult multiple redundancy fit content key generic title professional debut bunch create stood resume article top customize enhance,0.99375,0.0529007229765473,9.16759447004608,0.4672740058816008,0,2023-11-30
CNN,Four new work benefits that may help you save more in 2024,2023-11-30 06:00:00,Jeanne Sahadi,"Saving enough money for retirement is always a challenge.But for anyone who doesn’t have emergency savings, or who has student loans to pay or who is a long-term part-time worker, that challenge is especially hard.Starting next year, however, the two most recent retirement laws – Secure Act and the Secure Act 2.0 – contain four provisions that may make it easier for some to bolster their retirement savings while also meeting more immediate financial obligations.A lot will be up to your employer, however, for two reasons. First, of the four provisions they are only required to implement one of them. The others are optional, said Brian Graff, CEO of the American Retirement Association.And second, even employers who choose to implement one or more of the provisions may not do so until later in the year as they are still awaiting IRS guidance on outstanding questions and figuring out the administrative complexities of implementation, Graff noted.Paying off student loans can put a crimp in how much someone can save for retirement. Recent college graduates on staff may be most likely to have student loan debt, but their older colleagues do, too.The National Institute on Retirement Security found that the 13% of employed Gen Xers – those next in line to retire after the Baby Boomers – still have student loan debt, with a median of $25,000 and an average of $40,000.And, NIRS noted, “The average amount of retirement savings is consistently lower for Gen X households with student loan debt than those without.”Starting next year, Secure 2.0 will let employers offer matching contributions to employees who are making student loan payments and put that match into the employee’s 401(k) account. That way, the employee can accrue retirement savings even if they aren’t able to make significant contributions themselves.A survey by ARA found that a third of employers said they were seriously considering offering a match and Graff thinks more may get on board by 2025. “A lot of employers think it’s a good benefit to attract and retain younger workers,” he said.Apart from Secure 2.0 provisions, Congress passed a separate law that lets employers give workers up to $5,250 tax free to offset the payment of principal and interest on their workers’ federal and private student loans. That provision is only in effect, however, until December 31, 2025.Such a benefit, if an employer offers it, might free up an employee to put more into their 401(k).Secure 2.0 includes two provisions that pertain to emergency savings. Both are optional for employers to implement.The one companies are most likely to adopt, at least initially, is essentially an additional form of a hardship withdrawal from your 401(k), Graff said.When the ARA surveyed plan sponsors, 10% said they will add it and another 44% said they are taking a hard look at it.This provision lets you take out up to $1,000 a year, penalty free, from your 401(k) for any type of emergency, no explanation required. The withdrawal will still be subject to income tax.Employees may choose to pay the money back within three years through regular paycheck contributions, and they would get a tax deduction for those contributions just as they do for regular 401(k) contributions. But in order to take a second withdrawal of $1,000 in another year, the first amount withdrawn must have been paid back in full.The second emergency saving provision is often referred to as the “side car.” It involves an employer creating an emergency fund for an employee within their 401(k) plan, and letting an employee make direct contributions to that fund. The employer would cap how much may go into the fund, but under the law it can’t exceed $2,500.Your employer would match your contributions to the emergency fund but that match would go into the retirement portion of your 401(k).Your contributions to the emergency fund would be subject to income tax, so you would be funding it with after-tax money. The employer match, however, would still be treated as tax deferred to you – meaning the amount won’t show up as taxable income to you in the year it is made. And it will be allowed to grow untaxed until you withdraw it in retirement.Once you have hit the cap in the emergency fund, you may either stop making contributions or redirect further contributions to your 401(k) retirement savings account, Graff said.The provision that employers must implement as a result of both Secure Act and Secure 2.0 pertains to long-term part-time workers and their eligibility to participate in a company’s 401(k) plan.It used to be a part-time worker had to work at least 1,000 hours over a consecutive 12-month period to be eligible. But thanks to the Secure Act passed in 2019, a part-time worker who has worked at least 500 hours over a 12-month period for three consecutive years (e.g., from January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2023) will be eligible to participate in their employer’s 401(k) plan in 2024.And Secure 2.0, which was passed at the end of the last year, made the eligibility criteria even easier, requiring that part-time workers who log at least 500 hours a year only need to do so for two consecutive years to be eligible. But that provision won’t take effect until after December 31, 2024. That means in 2025, any part-timer who has logged 500 years annually in 2023 and 2024 would be eligible to start saving in their employer’s 401(k) and would be eligible for the employer match.",5450,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/success/retirement-savings-2024-policies/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,company pass cap essentially effect nirs ceo retire explanation type withdrawal emergency separate bolster withdraw significant american december worker make await year xers retain act back paycheck offering result income attract untaxed order include initially median employee student offset hit administrative hardship form reason hour adopt especially taxable implement boomer tax plan exceed baby start paid eligible security defer criterion institute side match direct easy additional irs accrue save involves secure meeting deduction pay found congress provision question x note challenge free money redirect subject colleague immediate interest board stop payment contain contribution household funding penalty hard require private employ portion survey annually offer national work pertain graff add withdrawn figure retirement loan choose period crimp outstanding debt employer consecutive complexity young put give regular graduate gen saving brian refer consider financial amount low sponsor show january account ara meaning law benefit average lot pertains eligibility grow treat guidance principal implementation line recent college federal create consistently staff optional fund participate,0.9661,0.0,9.149191246431968,0.4099358974358973,0,2023-11-30
CNN,‘Tesla of the seas’ will take students to school in Sweden,2023-11-30 04:11:00,Jacopo Prisco,"In Värmdö, a municipality of 10,000 small islands near Stockholm in Sweden, the school commute is about to get a whole lot more exciting for a few lucky students.Starting in December, the archipelago’s four schools will be the first users of the X Shore Pro, a new electric boat by a Swedish manufacturer that’s been described as the “Tesla of the seas.”The boat is 26 feet (8 meters) long and seats up to 10 people, has a top speed of 30 knots (about 35 mph) and a range of about 100 nautical miles (about 115 miles), only achievable at a lower cruising speed of around 20 knots and heavily dependent on load and sea conditions. Fully electric, it produces no emissions or noise, resulting in a smoother ride that it says is far kinder to marine habitats.“We believe in prioritizing the health and well-being of our students and the environment,” says Maria Niläng, principal of the Värmdö Archipelago Schools. “With this innovative electric school shuttle boat, we’re not just providing efficient transportation; we’re pushing for a cleaner society, and a brighter, healthier future for our students.”Founded in 2019, X Shore had previously released two electric leisure boats, the high-performance Eelex 8000 and the smaller X Shore 1. The X Shore Pro, which is meant for commercial operations or coast guards, is based on the former and shares most of its specifications.“I think the reason why we are being compared to Tesla is that when we released our X Shore 1, that was the first time you could buy a high-performance electric boat at the same price level as a car,” says Jenny Keisu, X Shore’s chief evangelist officer. “The media started referring to that as the Model 3 moment of the boating industry,” she adds, citing Tesla’s most affordable car. The X Shore 1 costs upwards of €109,000 (about $119,000), but the more expensive models in the lineup start at €195,000 (about $213,000).According to Keisu, the experience of riding an X Shore boat is radically different to a traditional one. “On a normal motorboat you have fumes, so it smells like you’re standing behind a car, which can make you feel sick,” she says. “We don’t have anything like that. We also don’t have any noise, so you can get out to sea and talk to people, or listen to your favorite music.”The batteries that power the boat are similar to those found on electric vehicles. “They are lithium-ion batteries, but they are certified for the marine environment, so they need to be much safer around water,” Keisu says. “They use normal automotive charging, so with a supercharger they can charge in 30 minutes, but they can also charge on [equipment] that is typically present in all marinas. That way, our different models charge somewhere between two hours to five hours.” Using a household electric outlet is also possible, but with vastly increased charging times.According to Keisu, the charging infrastructure for boats already exists, because even vessels with internal combustion engines need to charge batteries that power electric systems and appliances on board. “The only difference is that we [X Shore] use our batteries also for propulsion, so we have much larger battery packs,” she says. “The boating industry should do more to transition [to electric vehicles] because boating is much worse for the environment than cars — the average leisure boat emits around four times as much CO2 as the average car.”Electric propulsion in boats, just like in cars, isn’t new. “It has existed for well over 100 years,” says Timothy McCoy, an engineering professor at the University of Michigan, in the US, who is not involved with the project. “Using batteries as the main energy storage medium is also not new: diesel-electric submarines have been using lead acid batteries for over 100 years to operate when submerged, cruise ships have been using diesel-electric propulsion since the 1980s,” he explains, adding that many other ship types now use either hybrid or fully battery-electric propulsion systems.However, technological constraints may be slowing down the electrification of boats, including small leisure boats such as those manufactured by X Shore. “Mainly it is the energy density of the batteries,” explains McCoy. “This is the same issue that the auto industry is struggling with presently.”Brandon Taravella, an engineering professor at the University of New Orleans, agrees. “Batteries are currently just too heavy for the amount of energy that they provide,” he says. “Boats and ships are very weight sensitive. For every kilogram of diesel or gasoline, a boat needs to carry 40 kilograms of batteries to have the same energy output. Boats and ships have to carry all of their energy with them, so carrying around 40 times the weight of their energy is cost prohibitive as well as design prohibitive.”Boats and ships with combustion engines are now starting to face scattered bans in lakes and waterways across the world — for example, diesel and gasoline engines will be banned from Amsterdam’s canals from 2025, and Norway is planning zero emissions requirements for cruise ships, tourist boats and ferries in its UNESCO World Heritage fjords by 2026.“I think this is an area where we could make a huge difference in terms of both CO2 [emissions] and helping marine wildlife very, very quickly if we get some assistance,” Keisu says. “We need politicians and governments to push either with subsidies or with bans, because this needs to happen.”",5453,https://www.cnn.com/travel/x-shore-tesla-of-the-seas-students-school-sweden-climate-spc/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lucky listen environment fume typically project type possible niläng traditional moment excite brighter health december emits lineup healthier make engine leisure assistance affordable difference year level expensive manufacturer politician feel result medium motorboat industry submerge seat buy coast island include small certify heavily shore minute gasoline electric water quickly power propulsion student government efficient timothy keisu guard upwards canal vastly lake huge reason hour norway time commute system transportation officer maria innovative operation battery ban start long involve provide pro rid planning fully smoother previously release share sensitive diesel mile society värmdö radically nautical manufacture vehicle prohibitive shuttle evangelist issue dependent slow energy kinder happen found load talk emission waterway knot price amsterdam x outlet automotive university meant equipment ferry engineering combustion technological orleans heavy michigan produce unesco stockholm density cost board future currently believe household similar school range transition present wildlife model large submarine fjord tourist constraint weight brandon heritage boat struggle prioritize pack infrastructure base add operate design supercharger jenny explains archipelago meter kilogram exists commercial speed eelex vessel output carry electrification charge foot experience normal former sweden sick subsidy exist safer zero refer swedish requirement world amount noise low hybrid lead tesla cruise mph ship different car user agrees professor cleaner average achievable lot described appliance smell marina term taravella principal municipality favorite scatter compare chief auto marine acid mccoy storage area ride internal increase condition top stand push,0.98065,0.1650467632495873,8.324958371877887,0.4801872671275654,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,"The surprising dating life of Henry Kissinger, a West Wing ‘playboy’",2023-11-29 23:01:00,Timothy Bella,"Henry Kissinger was about to get lucky with Zsa Zsa Gabor. And it was due, in part, to Richard M. Nixon’s setting them up. Seriously.The diplomat and the Hungarian American socialite were an unlikely couple, but they had hit it off after sitting next to each other during a state dinner at the White House, with the actress raving about Kissinger’s big brain. Kissinger drove her home after dinner in Beverly Hills in 1970 and asked whether he could come inside for a drink, “with Henry showing signs of making an amorous approach to me,” Gabor recalled in “One Lifetime Is Not Enough,” her 1991 autobiography.But as Kissinger was about to lean in for a kiss, his beeper went off. It was the president. The same man who had set them up was now blocking his national security adviser from getting to first base.“Henry, come back immediately. I need you,” Gabor later recalled the president saying to Kissinger.Nixon killed the vibes, and Kissinger scrambled to drop off Gabor and peeled out of her driveway toward San Clemente, Calif., the home of the president’s “Western White House,” The Washington Post reported years later.As Kissinger drove off in a rush, he got the black sedan entangled in the electronic gates surrounding Gabor’s home, scraping and denting the car. “Oh my God,” Kissinger said, according to Gabor’s book, “this is President Nixon’s car!”“He screwed up that one kiss,” Gabor said of Kissinger to David Letterman in a 1987 interview.Letterman paused before joking how Kissinger missed his chance, while also offering a sarcastic dig at the diplomat’s decision-making: “You know, I think that’s about all he screwed up.”The story and career of Kissinger, who died Wednesday at the age of 100, was marked by both achievement and criticism — a Jewish refugee who fled Nazi Germany with his family, a prominent practitioner of realpolitik who served Presidents Nixon and Gerald Ford, a polarizing figure deemed amoral and unprincipled by critics, and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize under controversial circumstances. But when it came to his personal life, there was another dynamic that was perhaps most surprising: Women were drawn to the man Women’s Wear Daily once dubbed the “Playboy of the Western Wing.”At a time when Kissinger was shaping foreign policy for years, he was also seeing stunning starlets of the era. He even befriended Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner, who gifted Kissinger a subscription to the magazine after he learned the diplomat showed up to a party carrying an envelope of classified information and told everybody it was his copy of Playboy. (In reality, it was Nixon’s 1969 “silent majority” speech.)While some questioned the validity of Kissinger as a sophisticated sex symbol, he publicly embraced the persona. The New York Post described him as “the swinging bachelor of the Nixon administration” until he met his second wife, Nancy Maginnes, whom he married in 1974. Before marriage, Kissinger acknowledged he liked the attention that went with being “Washington’s greatest swinger,” meaning a serial dater in 1970s parlance.“That’s no compliment,” he said of the title in a Women’s Wear Daily (WWD) profile in 1971. “That’s faint praise.”He confirmed his dating appetite to Time magazine in 1972: “I go out with actresses because I’m not very apt to marry one.”So, how did Kissinger the playboy — short, plump and graying with a deep voice and German accent — become a thing? Well, The Post is perhaps responsible for bringing to light Kissinger’s social life, which mostly consisted of dinner parties, soirees and brunches. At a 1969 cocktail party at the home of D.C. gadfly Barbara Howar, Kissinger, who was in his first year as national security adviser under Nixon, was nursing a drink when he was approached by The Post’s Sally Quinn.“You really are a swinger, aren’t you?” she asked.“I told her, ‘I can’t admit that I’m a swinger without getting into trouble. I can’t admit that I’m not a swinger, so why don’t we say I’m a secret swinger?’” Kissinger recalled of the night to The Post in 1979.After Quinn printed her story, the narrative surrounding Kissinger changed, with newspaper and magazine articles becoming more interested in whom he was dating rather than his views on foreign policy. Although he’d later joke in a call to Quinn that he thought it was “suicidal to talk to you,” he also made it clear she was responsible for the newfound attention that he enjoyed, according to the New York Post: “You made me what I am today.”“He is worldly, humorous, sophisticated and a cavalier with women,” Joyce Haber, a Los Angeles Times columnist and friend whom he visited on the West Coast, told WWD at the time. Gloria Steinem, a feminist icon and another friend, described him to the magazine as “the only interesting man in the Nixon administration.”Around the time that Hefner printed a poll claiming that Kissinger was the most desired man to date among Playboy playmates, the diplomat was connected to Jill St. John, an actress best known as the first American Bond girl of the James Bond film franchise. The pair made tabloid headlines when they inadvertently set off the alarm at St. John’s Hollywood mansion late one night as they walked out to her pool.“What did you expect?” he said to WWD. “I was teaching her chess.” They both denied a TV report that they had “secretly married.”“There has never been a romance,” St. John told the magazine in 1971. “It has not been and will never be a great romance.”Others, such as Candice Bergen, noted years later how Kissinger “was highly intelligent, very charming.” But there was a lack of romance that came, in part, because of his work.“I was always home by midnight,” Marsha Metrinko, a former actress who dated Kissinger “dozens of times” in New York, California and D.C., said in 1974. “There always seemed to be a crisis. In San Clemente, he’d always get called away from the table a lot.”Even after Kissinger messed up the kiss with Gabor, she sent him flowers, which prompted a thank-you call from the diplomat: “My whole staff looks at me differently since I got flowers from you.” She accepted his invite for another date, but Kissinger had to cancel the night of the meetup. When Gabor asked why, Kissinger again blamed his boss.“I can’t fly down because we’re invading Cambodia tomorrow,” Kissinger said, according to The Post. “It’s a big secret, you are the first person outside the White House who knows about it.”But some people who knew him best rebutted that Kissinger truly recognized himself as a playboy.“He never was a playboy!” Lenore Fleischer Reich, his former sister-in-law during his first marriage to Ann Fleischer, told the New York Post in June 1974. “Never, never, never!”“That swinger stuff is bunk. He never was a good mixer,” retired Harvard professor Carl Friedrich, a mentor to Kissinger, told the newspaper. “Nixon said, ‘My God, Henry, you’ve got to have a human quality.’ He went along with it because he was obedient.”Even his friends joked that Kissinger wasn’t built to be a true playboy.“Henry’s idea of sex is to slow the car down to 30 mph when he drops you off at the door,” Howar recalled in 1974.Five years into their marriage, Maginnes tried thinking about her husband’s time as a playboy when she was interviewed in The Post. By that time, she could only laugh at the idea of her husband as Henry Kissinger the swinger.",7386,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2023/11/29/henry-kissinger-dies-dating-life-playboy/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story lucky lack hill information amoral achievement rebut sally post retire acknowledge social sex laugh administration henry maginnes peace print teach american inside make dater sign electronic enjoy great year poll silent voice rush back clear offering trouble beeper bergen john hungarian surround part interested coast starlet inadvertently apt persona change scramble late mansion ann hit prompt nobel serve shape western hugh bond time california woman god fleischer due walk nixon quinn admit home envelope serial invade mentor prize accent barbara entangle marriage differently alarm secretly diplomat big accord dubbed hollywood responsible security family columnist angeles classify interviewed brunch joked call plump deny newspaper personal humorous drink light pair married report tabloid stun appetite lenore secret richard cocktail claim gadfly pause highly cambodia knew playboy profile actress recognize validity clemente dozen gerald slow approach san cavalier set drove drop carl idea bachelor suicidal deem refugee learn talk deep crisis meetup letterman gabor bunk view question note wednesday jewish majority flower joyce winner speech midnight headline table bring practitioner worldly desire prominent wwd cancel harvard couple date foreign expect symbol compliment faint fly girl husband peel night interest nazi drawn soiree gray romance kissinger controversial party screw invite away gift policy brain marked west adviser state book reich york daily franchise connect president magazine person block haber intelligent candice befriend publisher washington steinem national age unprincipled june tv built critic life metrinko wear house marry figure sophisticated accepted amorous told dynamic swing dent publicly film howar embrace driveway carry recall realpolitik mixer playmate vibe friend friedrich attention flee stuff zsa james former german miss nursing blame jill tomorrow joke criticism narrative visit consist reality nancy show mph gloria rave car meaning black professor newfound joking germany scrap kill circumstance dinner described swinger subscription career copy short ford white mess chance polarize kiss hefner socialite wife sarcastic david title confirm marsha lifetime surprising human feminist gate lean staff article icon immediately beverly,0.99525,0.5280259951259139,6.849523809523806,0.4270280101162453,0,2023-11-29
CNN,OpenAI officially announces Sam Altman has returned as CEO and Microsoft gains a non-voting board seat,2023-11-29 20:52:00,David Goldman,"Twelve days after OpenAI fired Sam Altman as CEO, the company formally announced that it has hired him back.The company also said it has a new board, consisting of Chairman Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce; former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers; and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, who is the sole remaining director from the board that ousted Altman on November 17. Key stakeholder Microsoft has also gained a non-voting observer seat on the company’s board after the company had hired away Altman and former OpenAI Chairman Greg Brockman, only to lose them again to OpenAI a couple of days later – an outcome CEO Satya Nadella said he was fine with.OpenAI called the new board “initial,” signaling that it will add more directors in the future.Altman, in a company blog post, thanked the previous board that fired him for their contributions to the company. He also reinstated Mira Murati as the company’s chief technology officer. Murati was named interim CEO for a little over a day until the company announced that former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear would take over as CEO — a role he held for less than a week.The chaos at OpenAI led the vast majority of the company’s 800 employees to threaten to quit unless Altman and Brockman were reinstated. A notable signatory was Ilya Sutskever, a former board member who had played a major role in Altman’s ouster. Sustkever later apologized for his actions, saying he regretted the decision.Sustkever’s role as chief scientist at OpenAI appears to be unsettled. He was left off Altman’s leadership team list.“I love and respect Ilya, I think he’s a guiding light of the field and a gem of a human being,” Altman wrote in the blog post. “I harbor zero ill will towards him. While Ilya will no longer serve on the board, we hope to continue our working relationship and are discussing how he can continue his work at OpenAI.”Altman reserved most praise for Brockman, who is returning to the company after he quit. Altman said they will formalize on the company’s org chart the fact that the two are “partners in running this company.”“Thank you for everything you have done since the very beginning, and for how you handled things from the moment this started and over the last week,” Altman wrote to Brockman.Altman also praised the company’s employees and customers, noting OpenAI didn’t lose any of them throughout the ordeal.“I am sure books are going to be written about this time period, and I hope the first thing they say is how amazing the entire team has been,” Altman said. “You stood firm for each other, this company, and our mission.”The company must improve its governance structure and hire an independent investigator to determine what went wrong leading to Altman’s ouster, the CEO said.In a post on X, Altman acknowledged “real misunderstandings” between him and members of the board.“For my part, it is incredibly important to learn from this experience and apply those learnings as we move forward as a company,” Altman wrote on X. “I welcome the board’s independent review of all recent events.”",3065,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/tech/openai-sam-altman-board-microsoft/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,chaos quit partner run greg longer company outcome improve blog secretary left couple post formalize larry ceo customer acknowledge sole harbor played moment technology satya hire announce mira board review signatory role chairman contribution org handle misunderstanding real away forward important ilya regret vast thanked book seat scientist nadella begin determine part twelve altman oust sutskever relationship microsoft stakeholder observer work firm add employee sustkever entire learning twitch incredibly respect director period serve team adam remain treasury time experience wrong shear fine investigator officer former zero gem praise discuss start continue apply taylor threaten bret call major lead consist reserve move emmett love light governance member return november field angelo previous lose amaze summer apologize structure welcome week held signal ouster guide independent brockman leadership event chief hope sam recent key quora fact openai unsettled interim learn fire human day murati action stood reinstate formally write note x initial majority notable chart salesforce,0.9209,0.097879282218597,8.169114754098356,0.4114598364598365,0,2023-11-29
CNN,A climber tumbled hundreds of feet down Oregon’s highest peak. Volunteer rescuers happened to see it - and saved her life,2023-11-29 19:38:00,Sarah Dewberry,"A 36-year-old woman slipped and fell several hundred feet from Oregon’s highest mountain right before the eyes of a group of volunteer rescue workers who rushed to her aid – and helped save her life.The woman was coming down a popular path on Mt. Hood, about 70 miles east of Portland, on Saturday morning, according to the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office. Mt. Hood is the highest peak in Oregon, standing at roughly 11,240 feet.The climber “slid and tumbled down the mountain for approximately 300-400 feet,” Brian McCall, a spokesperson with the sheriff’s office, told CNN.The brutal fall was witnessed by members of Portland Mountain Rescue, a nonprofit volunteer organization focused on helping people in mountainous areas. The group called 911 and rushed to the woman, helping stabilize her and “provide initial medical care,” the sheriff’s office said.Additional groups of rescuers arrived and helped keep the woman warm for seven hours as officials worked to get her off the mountain safely, authorities said.The climber, Leah Brown, told CNN in an email she doesn’t know what caused her fall.“This is the part I don’t remember,” Brown said. “I can only guess it was either an ice tool or a crampon (the steel spikes on climbing boots) that didn’t land and stick like it should have and I became detached from the mountain.”In a Facebook post, Portland Mountain Rescue wrote the woman’s injuries “prevented self-rescue,” adding their members worked with the Crag Rats group, also an all-volunteer, nonprofit organization.Authorities created “complex rope systems” and transported the climber with a litter - a type of stretcher typically used to evacuate victims in difficult situations. The woman was eventually evacuated to a parking lot at 9:30 p.m. and taken to a hospital, according to the sheriff’s office, which also took part in the rescue.Authorities did not share further information about the nature and extent of the woman’s injuries. Sheriff’s office spokesperson Sgt. Ross Clemson told CNN the woman was treated and released from a local hospital.Brown told CNN she was diagnosed with a concussion and had multiple bruises on her arms and legs but said, “Otherwise, I’m okay.” Brown said she did not break any bones.“The thing I’d like to most stress is my appreciation and gratitude for the folks from PMR (Portland Mountain Rescue) and Hood River Crag Rats who evacuated me and took incredible care of me the whole time,” Brown said.“I owe them my life.”In a statement after the rescue, Portland Mountain Rescue warned of the dangerous winter conditions at the mountain.“The short days and lower temperatures mean that the snow tends to be very hard and icy, and the route conditions tend to be much steeper and technical. Also descending the mountain in icy conditions is much more difficult than ascending,” the group said.“Only those with expert mountaineering and ice climbing skills should attempt Mt. Hood in winter, especially when there have been long dry spells with no precipitation. Appropriate and thorough training is critical,” it added.",3076,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/travel/mt-hood-portland-climber-fall-rescue/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,email dry leah information east boot typically arm icy post stick high type difficult extent skill hospital nature owe attempt tool leg spike worker victim arrive mountain climb eventually rush detach technical bruise guess hard incredible crampon tumble mountainous witness brown part appropriate stretcher eye warm gratitude tend popular work path approximately add training official facebook descend volunteer expert portland ross temperature pmr statement told rescue nonprofit concussion appreciation hour ice roughly woman clemson evacuate time clackamas ascend especially foot focus mccall rescuer system spokesperson stabilize aid sgt brian mt cnn injury long accord provide remember dangerous saturday call spell low authority rat share release rope transport parking safely member mile climber stress lot steeper medical save brutal county mountaineer precipitation organization morning hood diagnose river critical short treat folk oregon slip land local prevent route litter group multiple steel fell area crag sheriff warn office day snow create slid condition hundred write complex situation stand fall initial peak winter break,0.82235,0.2925877763328998,9.109378151260504,0.5052604802604803,0,2023-11-29
CNN,Google reaches deal with Canada to keep news content on its platform,2023-11-29 17:19:00,Brian Fung,"Google has agreed to pay Canadian publishers for their news content, backing down from a high-stakes threat to block all news content produced in the country on its platforms after the tech giant and the Canadian government announced a deal Wednesday to avert the looming crisis.The agreement resolves tensions between Google and Canada over a controversial law known as C-18 requiring digital platforms to compensate news publishers for their work.And it is the latest twist in a global debate over the role digital platforms play in facilitating — or stifling — news publishers, particularly small, independent outlets.Under the announced deal with Google, details of which remain murky because the law’s final regulations have yet to be formally published, the search giant will pay $100 million CAD ($73.5 million US) a year into a fund that will be distributed to publishers. Google’s contributions will be indexed to inflation, the Canadian government said.In addition, instead of negotiating with individual publishers over payment, Google “will have the option to work with a single collective to distribute its contribution to all interested eligible news businesses based on the number of full-time equivalent journalists engaged by those businesses,” said Canadian Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge in a statement.It was not immediately clear how the collective might function or be governed; a spokesperson for St-Onge didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.“We are pleased that the Government of Canada has committed to addressing our core issues with Bill C-18,” said Google President of Global Affairs Kent Walker in a statement, adding: “While we work with the government through the exemption process based on the regulations that will be published shortly, we will continue sending valuable traffic to Canadian publishers.”The Canadian government has said final regulations on the implementation of C-18 will be rolled out by Dec. 19.The Google agreement marks a departure from the path taken by Instagram-parent Meta, which opted to pull news content from its platforms in Canada in response to C-18. Meta announced its plans to block news for its Canadian users in June and began rolling out the change in August.At around the time, Google had also threatened to “remove links to Canadian news from our Search, News and Discover products in Canada,” and warned that C-18 would “make it untenable for us to continue offering our Google News Showcase product in Canada.”Unlike Meta, Google did not execute on that plan and negotiated with the Canadian government, resulting in Wednesday’s deal. Google’s financial contributions under the agreement are 41% lower than what Canadian officials previously said should be the monetary threshold for Google to qualify for an exemption from C-18.Asked whether the Google agreement may change Meta’s stance on news in Canada, company spokesman Andy Stone told CNN: “Unlike search engines, we do not proactively pull news from the internet to place in our users’ feeds and we have long been clear that the only way we can reasonably comply with the Online News Act is by ending news availability for people in Canada.”After Meta removed news content from its platforms in Canada, some smaller news publishers that depended on Meta for distribution reported difficulties reaching readers.The option for Google to negotiate with a single collective helps address one of the tech giant’s main objections to the law. The deal also resolves Google’s complaint that C-18 would require it to pay publishers on the basis of individual links to news articles, the company told CNN, though it did not elaborate on the details of that provision.The impact of the deal on other, similar legislative proposals worldwide is uncertain. But how the agreement with Google plays out could potentially shape the course of those policies.",3890,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/tech/google-deal-with-canada-news-content/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,execute news kent cad potentially company distribution threat act instead produce canadian twist indexed facilitate untenable proactively feed announce loom final valuable controversial role payment contribution make pascale engine policy country canada year unlike inflation option monetary traffic roll similar clear murky function digital bill offering deal result debate andy require qualify place equivalent agreement president begin interested global internet block google publisher small heritage affair send stance work platform path june base spokesman million avert add official stifle change government request late statement backing collective told mark shortly shape difficulty showcase resolve regulation remain detail pull depend time online compensate agree business minister link elaborate spokesperson reach opt remove plan course worldwide cnn core discover long eligible continue complaint exemption threaten proposal address financial addition publish comply low product journalist pleased previously threshold giant tension law report impact user negotiate play commit basis respond single legislative particularly availability uncertain issue implementation independent engage individual search response stone content govern departure pay distribute process warn walker objection article formally wednesday number meta immediately tech fund,0.6052500000000001,0.1542416452442159,12.16913616398243,0.4981179138321995,0,2023-11-29

CNN,All kids want for Christmas this year … Robux and gaming subscriptions,2023-11-29 16:28:00,Samantha Murphy Kelly,"Nicole Randol — a Missouri-based mother of two boys, ages 6 and 10 — recently posted a message on a popular Facebook parenting group about Robux, the virtual gaming currency for the platform Roblox: Target was having a 40%-off sale for Robux.In the moments that followed, nearly two hundred parents responded, saying they ran to the store to buy handfuls of the cards, or quickly added them to their online shopping carts before they sold out.“I expect it to be the most exciting thing they open [on Christmas],” Randol, who bought two $100 Robux cards, told CNN. “Because we always say ‘no,’ they are going to be very surprised. The most they hoped to get and asked for was $20 worth.”Like the Randol kids, many young people this holiday shopping season are asking for virtual currency, such as Roblox Robux and Fortnite V-bucks, that give users access to premium features, exclusive games and the ability to create and sell items — even more so than physical video games and other toys. Roblox reported 70.2 million average daily users in November, up 20% from a year ago. Rival platforms such as Fortnite and Minecraft boast similar user numbers as children and teens spend billions of hours each year in these virtual worlds.According to a recent study published by the Entertainment Software Association, the majority of girls (59%) and boys (86%) ages 10 - 17 said they want video game-related gifts for the holidays, with video game subscriptions (39%), consoles (38%), gaming accessories (32%) and in-game currency (29%) trumping asks for physical video games (22%).Although the concept of virtual gaming money isn’t new, platforms such as Roblox continue to build out their own economy, where kids not only spend money on virtual items for avatars such as clothing, accessories and new content and features, but can create and sell them, too.“It’s an outgrowth of the ‘freemium’ model that we’ve seen for a while on app-based games,” said Christopher Byrne, a toy consultant and founder of The Toy Guy. “From a marketing standpoint, the genius of these is that they keep players engaged in the world of the game.”Roblox declined to share data around how Robux was selling this holiday season. Fortnite’s parent company Epic Games did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gaming subscriptions continue to gain popularity, too. For example, Microsoft’s subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, and Sony’s PlayStation Plus both offer access to a library of games for a monthly fee; Google’s cloud gaming service Stadia Pro lets people play games without a console; and Apple Arcade provides a similar service for iOS, Mac, and Apple TV users. Prices vary depending on the service and varying tiers.“Both subscriptions and digital currencies have been popular in the past years,” said Michael Inouye, an analyst with ABI Research. “But subscription services, due to more recent additions of premium tiers, likely have seen more interest than previous years, especially now that they carry a higher annual price tag.”The study comes as projected toy sales for the holiday season are expected to be down this year amid the sluggish economy and households prioritizing essentials. About 200.4 million people, or more than 60% of the US population, shopped over the five days from Thanksgiving to Black Friday and through Cyber Monday, trumping last year’s record of 196.7 million shoppers, according to the National Retail Federation, the retail industry’s largest trade group.But the amount of money they spent in total on traditional seasonal gifts, decor, and food was down. The group said the average consumer spent about $227 on gifts, well below the average record of $361 spent in 2019 on holiday purchases.Beyond digital currency and subscriptions, one of the biggest growth areas in gaming is what Byrne calls “cozy” games, known as non-competitive or non-aggressive titles that enable players to explore worlds and relax their mind.Some console advancements have also made it easier to have more dynamic interactive experiences, such as Nintendo’s WarriorWare which has games that get players up and jumping, and competing.“The play in the living room may look a lot different,” said Byrne, adding that parents who grew up on gaming are more likely to join in nowadays. “What’s changed, naturally, is the games that families are playing.”According to ESA, more than 212 million Americans play video games on a regular basis.Many retailers this season are also offering gaming consoles at a discounted price of 15% off, along with bundle deals that tend to be bought up quickly. “The best advice is to set a Google alert for a console you want and you can have deals pushed to you,” Byrne said.Gaming-related items aren’t the only things on gift givers’ radars this year. Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of toy reviews site TTPM, said people have been snapping up discounted toys from popular brands such as Barbie, Lego, Hot Wheels, Squishmallows and LOL. Breakthrough items such as Spinmaster’s Bitzies and the relaunch of the all-new Furby are gaining attention, too.Still, with the rise of subscriptions and gaming currency, what lands under the Christmas tree may be smaller in size than years before.“It’s hard to speak for Santa, but if he really is as magical as kids believe, he should be able to source the gift cards,” Bryne said. “It would give the elves a break from actually making the toys … and besides, you can fit a lot more gift cards on the sleigh.”CNN’s Parija Kavilanz contributed to this report",5533,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/tech/kid-christmas-robux-gaming-subscriptions/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,cloud company michael nintendo rival naturally post source contribute item data project retailer growth spinmaster moment asks popularity traditional excite standpoint push american sluggish review make jumping rise brand year accessory outgrowth feature digital advice offering deal software industry explore mac buy analyst google small tend consultant exclusive economy platform quickly recently decor food million site thanksgiving facebook retail change request handful virtual squishmallows christopher library amid hour stadium due especially epic hop game santa premium cnn fortnite consumer physical relax big accord message provide continue pro family bundle call addition shopping tree share card report november ability sell sony easy elf past parija ran service avatar furby randol essential land silver set nicole monday association cyber spent price size open majority lego record number bitzies break founder money population seasonal hot billion toy expect federation entertainment arcade high girl minecraft tier interest cart guy boast believe gift radar nowadays household similar parent holiday hard model large target daily genius abi christmas discount concept wheel bryne offer popular prioritize season national microsoft age tv add marketing ago told dynamic research kid living friday depend annual carry shop online interactive young give child spend experience attention trump regular console room barbie boy inouye build total playstation breakthrough world amount ttpm warriorware publish alert decline relaunch different access video roblox black user clothing store follow previous average play cozy lot bought respond mother subscription grow player apple advancement fee freemium giver enable join group engage currency fit kavilanz surprised content recent title snap byrne area magical study day create shopper hundred trade speak xbox robux monthly vary immediately,0.99575,0.0542201337429965,8.564562043795622,0.4746928439699524,0,2023-11-29
NPR,Gary Oldman had 'free rein' in spy thriller 'Slow Horses' — now back for Season 3,2023-11-29 16:01:00,Elizabeth Blair,"The third season of the Apple TV+ drama Slow Horses, based on Mick Herron's Slough House novels, debuts Nov. 29. Gary Oldman plays Jackson Lamb, the comically unpleasant leader of a gang of dejected British spies. He smokes and drinks on the job, needs a shower, eats junk and has flatulence issues, which he seems to use strategically. Lamb's band of spooks became Slow Horses, as they're called, after messing up their careers in a variety of mishaps, including botching a surveillance operation and leaving a top secret file on a train. They've messed up good and Lamb never lets them forget it. ""Working with you has been the lowest point in a disappointing career,"" he tells them in a supposed pep talk. ""Despicable characters are more interesting to write about than kind, humane characters,"" says Herron. Lamb ""has a lot of unpleasant habits, very poor personal hygiene and a tendency to be as rude as he possibly can to his subordinates,"" Herron explains, ""What we don't know is how much of this he actually means."" Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman), right, and MI5's second in command Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) are formidable adversaries who constantly try to outplay each other. Apple TV+ hide caption Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman), right, and MI5's second in command Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) are formidable adversaries who constantly try to outplay each other. Oldman is a 'constant wonder' Herron says Gary Oldman called him before they started shooting the first season, which debuted in the spring of 2022. ""He wanted to talk about what I could tell him about Lamb that wasn't in the books,"" Herron recalls. ""And the fact is ... anything that's not in the books hasn't happened as far as I'm concerned. So Gary in many ways had free rein to add his own bits of history to the character. ""He likes to know what a character has in his fridge. He likes to know where characters went to school and what sort of childhood they had. And I've never written about any of that sort of thing. But Gary thinks about it when he's delivering his performance, and it's all part of the perfectly rounded spectacle that he brings to the screen."" Rosalind Eleazar and Christopher Chung play spies in Apple TV+'s Slow Horses. Apple TV+ hide caption Rosalind Eleazar and Christopher Chung play spies in Apple TV+'s Slow Horses. ""He's a constant wonder to me,"" says Slow Horses writer and executive producer Will Smith of Gary Oldman. Smith says Herron's take on the spy genre is refreshing — and a natural for TV — because his characters are so believable. ""People struggling with kind of relatable issues everyone goes through: divorce, grief, feeling they're not in the right place in their careers. They hate their boss,"" says Smith. Critics have raved about Slow Horses. The first two seasons were so successful, Apple TV+ ordered two more. 'Surrounded by losers, misfits and boozers' Another high-profile fan of the books is Mick Jagger who co-wrote the theme song. ""I really enjoyed creating the theme track for Slow Horses with Daniel Pemberton,"" Jagger writes on Instagram. ""I've read a lot of the books and was familiar with some of the more dark and unsavoury characters and knew the direction I wanted to take it...hope you enjoy it!"" Mick Jagger is among the many fans of Mick Herron's Slough House novels. The Rolling Stone's singer co-wrote and performs the theme song for the Apple TV+ series. Season 3 is based on Real Tigers, Herron's third novel in the Slough House series. The villains are different but Lamb and his spies are still very much the underdogs. ""Fiction is full of heroes,"" says Herron. ""I'm not averse to adding to their number but with Lamb, I'm more interested in his failings than I am in his virtues."" Lamb isn't all bluster. Herron adds that he might not have ""a heart of gold"" but he ""does have a moral code."" ""Fiction is full of heroes,"" says Herron.

Reuters,Richemont digital strategy goes back to square one,2023-11-29 13:25:00,Lisa Jucca,"MILAN, Nov 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Johann Rupert’s digital strategy may be heading back to the drawing board. Richemont’s (CFR.S) chairman last year agreed to sell the Swiss group’s online platform, Yoox Net-A-Porter, to luxury marketplace Farfetch (FTCH.N). Yet the U.S.-listed buyer’s current financial woes have made the deal unattractive. Even if the Cartier owner can extract itself, Rupert will be stuck with an old problem.Loss-making Farfetch looks ill-equipped to complete the transaction with Richemont. Shares in the loss-making company are down more than 70% since it agreed to acquire a majority stake in YNAP. Farfetch has cancelled an earnings announcement planned for Wednesday amid media reports that founder José Neves is planning to take the company private. The Telegraph reported that the company was in talks with both Richemont and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.However, Richemont is keeping its distance. The $66 billion group said on Wednesday it did not plan to invest in or lend to Farfetch. It could yet try to walk away from the deal, which has not yet closed despite clearing all necessary regulatory hurdles.The transaction has certainly lost its sparkle. Richemont had agreed to accept Farfetch shares in return for 47.5% of YNAP, to ensure the subsidiary had $290 million in cash on its balance sheet, and to provide a $450 million credit line. Farfetch’s battered prospects make that unappealing.It is unclear how easily Richemont can change course. One option might be for Rupert to drag out negotiations on terms that are still open, such as the adoption by Richemont brands of Farfetch’s online solutions, until the contract expires next year.But even if Rupert can extricate himself from the Farfetch situation, Richemont’s digital plans will still be unclear. In the past decade and a half, the company has taken control of Net-A-Porter, merged it into Yoox, delisted the combined company, and then tried to offload it to Farfetch. A failed sale of YNAP would drag on Richemont’s margins and make it harder to focus on its more profitable jewellery and high-end fashion businesses. Rupert’s online strategy could soon be back to square one.Follow @LJucca on XCONTEXT NEWSCompagnie Financiere Richemont said on Nov. 29 it has no financial obligations towards troubled luxury goods platform Farfetch and does not envisage lending to or investing in the U.S.-listed company.Farfetch founder José Neves is considering taking the company private, the Telegraph reported on Nov. 28.

USA TODAY,The Essentials: 'What Happens Later' star Meg Ryan shares her favorite rom-coms,2023-11-29 12:01:49,Laura Trujillo,"In a new series, USA TODAY’s The Essentials, celebrities share what fuels their lives. We're kicking off with Meg Ryan, Usher, Dove Cameron and Ariana DeBose. Meg Ryan, the queen of rom-coms, is back this fall with ""What Happens Later,"" an impossibly charming movie about a former couple who run into each other 25 years later in their 50s. A storm strands Willa (Ryan) and William (David Duchovny) in an airport and they compare the dreams they once shared and then lost. While she's been in more than a dozen movies, Ryan is perhaps best known for her quirky and adorable characters in seminal Nora Ephron movies ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've Got Mail,"" as well as Rob Reiner's ""When Harry Met Sally."" Ryan, 61, says love is endlessly interesting – at any age. ""How do your views of love and life change in that time? In some ways radically and in some ways not at all,"" she says. ""I didn't have that perspective at all when I was 20, so I needed all this time to have gone by to notice that there's naïveté and innocence involved as well. Maybe you learn that you don't want to be in that again, or maybe you don't learn at all, maybe (you) just go right for it again."" She shares her essentials: Ryan loves movies from the 1930s, '40s and '50s, including any with Claudette Colbert, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Katharine Hepburn, or Jimmy Stewart. She says she can spend entire afternoons or evenings watching them. Ryan's daughter, Daisy True, is now in college. But one of their favorite things to do is watch movies together. One of their favorites: ""The Philadelphia Story,"" a rom-com made in 1940 based on the play of the same name, starring Cary Grant, Hepburn and Stewart. ""She's with girls (in college) who haven't seen 'Philadelphia Story' and (I) can't get over that because it was like the staple of her growing up,"" Ryan says. INTERVIEW: Meg Ryan on love, aging and returning to rom-coms: 'It doesn't stop in your 20s' This might be cheating a little, but she did love reading it on the beach recently: ""Miss Subways,"" written by her co-star Duchovny. He gave her the book before they filmed ""What Happens Later,"" and the two joke that a photo taken by the paparazzi of her reading it at the beach single-handedly bumped sales for the book. The book, no surprise, is a romantic comedy based on an Irish legend. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

USA TODAY,"The Essentials: As Usher lights up the Las Vegas strip, here are his must-haves",2023-11-29 12:01:14,Anika Reed,"In a new series, USA TODAY’s The Essentials, celebrities share what fuels their lives. Usher's reign continues on as the king of R&B – and as the king of Las Vegas. The singer, whose final show of his Vegas ""My Way"" residency at Park MGM is Dec. 2, will keep his Sin City streak going come February when he headlines the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show at Allegiant Stadium. ""Vegas has offered an opportunity to celebrate the past and celebrate the records, the No. 1s, the connection to the to the audience, the entertainment,"" Usher tells USA TODAY. ""And then the Super Bowl moment offers not only that, but then a segue into the next chapter,"" teasing his new ""Coming Home"" album, also debuting Feb. 11. From his pre-show routine to how he spends time with his kids, these are Usher's Vegas essentials: ""We're swimming here a lot even though it's cold now – we have a heated pool, (so) that helps. My smaller kids love gymnastics; we love jumping spaces. My older kids we go paintballing, we go Go-kart riding indoors, outdoors. They're not quite old (enough) to gamble, and I don't encourage it because at this point they would only be spending my money. (Laughs.) ""Vegas is a world in itself and there is something for everybody here. It's a huge playground for adults, but it's also very, very welcoming to kids off the strip. We live here as well, so it definitely does help to have places and things for us to do to keep us occupied."" INTERVIEW: Usher preps for 'celebration' of Super Bowl halftime show, gets personal with diabetes pledge ""In order to do these shows, I really do have to take care of my body. Health is wealth with me. ""I wake up early, around 7 o'clock. Oddly enough, I have this thing with 7 o'clock on the dot. But at 7 o'clock, I'm waking up because my kids are waking me up. And then I've got to cater to them and give them their time, and you know, sing songs and have a good time and cook breakfast. If we're in Atlanta, I'm taking my kids to school. If we're here (in Las Vegas), we're getting online to make certain that we that we're ready for class. ""In the summertime when all of my kids are here, it consists of me getting them up and we'll go work out. We'll go to this place Impact. My oldest son likes to play basketball, so he's training here, but my younger kids they like to swim so they have a coach that they work with. And I spend a great deal of time at home up until about maybe 4 or 5 p.m. I make my way over to the to the theater. I have what would be my second workout; first workout's like around naptime, around 11 a.m. or 12 p.m., and then I come back and I actually have a little nap myself if I can. Most days I don't, but me and the kids have a nap."" Story continues below video. ""We hit it around 9 o'clock. We head to the stage and we have prayer circle, giving thanks that we have this time, we have this moment. We're present and cover ourselves, (to) make certain that the reason why we here is held up by God, and make certain that he protects us and brings us to the other side."" ""We're off stage about 10:30, 11 p.m. and the night goes from there. In the event that I'm not able to wind down, I've got to find something to do. So I might have a little cognac, you know what I'm saying, and I hang out with friends backstage, kick it. Maybe sometimes go out to a party or something like that. ""For the most part, I find a way to wind down. (The) day stops around 2 o'clock. I'm listening back, making notes, trying to figure out what I'm going to do for the next show. Talking to the crew, sending messages (and) texts, (and they're probably) like 'Why am I getting random texts from this guy at 2 o'clock in the morning? What the heck is going on?'

USA TODAY,"Her daughter, 15, desperately needed a transplant. So a determined mom donated her kidney.",2023-11-29 11:05:25,not specified,"This summer, the last thing on Kaitlin Seigel's mind was whether she'd be able to enjoy a Thanksgiving meal with her family. The 15-year-old from Clark, New Jersey, felt nauseous all the time. She was listless and all the color was gone from her face. She couldn't eat, and the lack of nourishment was making her weak. She didn't want to hang out with her friends or take part in any school activities, fearful she might get sick. The isolation made her sad and anxious. Her kidneys were failing. An exam revealed they were functioning at just 10%. Kaitlin's parents, Jennifer and Ken, were at a loss. ""It was a really difficult time,"" Jennifer said. But it wasn't entirely a surprise, either. Kaitlin has Charcot Marie Tooth disease, a condition that can affect movement and sensory nerves. (It has nothing to do with her teeth, Jennifer said. It was named for the three doctors who discovered the disease). Its severity can vary widely, but Kaitlin has a rare, more serious form of the incurable disease. The Seigels knew Kaitlin would need a transplant. But they also understood better than most families what that would entail: Ken also has CMT, an inherited genetic mutation, and has had three kidney transplants, his first in 1987. ""It's not that you want that experience for your kid,"" said Ken, who works in advertising sales. ""But we knew what to expect."" Now 54, Ken recalled getting up early on the day of his prom so he could receive dialysis. He's open about his medical history: ""You grow up faster, and you just deal with it."" As he and Jennifer saw Kaitlin struggling, though, they knew they didn't want her to have to go on dialysis. They contacted Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, so Jennifer could register as a living donor and be tested to see if she was a match for Kaitlin. She was. Mother and daughter were taken into their respective surgeries on Aug. 2, and the results for Kaitlin were almost immediately positive. Her new kidney is fully functioning and she's back to herself, back at school and back to spending time with her friends. They're grateful, too, for the doctors and nurses who took such great care of both of them. For Jennifer, 45, there was no hesitation in giving a kidney to her daughter. ""The doctor said to me, 'You'll be fine, you've had two kids,' (the Seigels have a 13-year-old son, too) and I knew I had to do this for Kaitlin,"" she said. Kidney transplants tend to mean a more difficult recovery for living donors than from the recipients, and while Jennifer said there was a lot of routine post-operative pain, there was also the joy of knowing her daughter's life would go back to normal. ""She went in sick and came out healthy,"" Jennifer said, ""and I went in healthy and needed some recovery time."" Still, she said it was ""100% worth it. The pain I went through meant nothing next to seeing her get better."" The whole family is grateful to see Kaitlin getting back to her usual happy, energetic self. The teenager is a big Broadway fan, and she has seen ""Moulin Rouge"" a dozen times. On the day the family spoke with USA TODAY, they had just seen a show in New York and had tickets to see another one soon. Kaitlin's dream is to attend the Tony Awards (June 16, 2024), but mostly, she said, she's happy because ""I am living a normal teenage life."" ""We are extremely thankful,"" Jennifer said. ""It's been almost four months. Life with kids moves very fast. She was very sick, and then she had the surgery and she went back to school in September, and she's back to normal. It's almost crazy when I stop to think about it."" Jennifer, too, is back to normal, going to the gym several times a week, raising her family with Ken and working as a mortgage loan officer. They're both optimistic about their daughter's future, and with good reason. ""Look at me,"" Ken said. ""I have a good, productive life and a great family."" And about that family: CMT isn't the only trait that's inherited. So is a deep sense of love and selflessness. Jennifer's mother, a personal trainer, volunteered to be a donor (at 71, she is past the age range for eligibility). And Ken's first kidney transplant came when he was a teenager. The donor: His own father.

CNN,Jonathan Majors assault trial begins Wednesday,2023-11-29 08:35:00,Alli Rosenbloom,"The trial in the assault and harassment case against Marvel actor Jonathan Majors is set to begin on Wednesday in New York City.The case stems from a March 25 domestic dispute involving Majors and his former girlfriend, Grace Jabbari. Majors has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and aggravated harassment.Following his initial arrest, a Manhattan judge released Majors on his own recognizance and granted a limited order of protection prohibiting contact with Jabbari, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office told CNN at the time.Jabbari claims that Majors struck her “about the face with an open hand, causing substantial pain and a laceration behind her ear,” according to a complaint she filed in New York City in March. She also claims he “put his hand on her neck, causing bruising and substantial pain.”In June, Majors filed a counter-complaint against Jabbari, claiming he was assaulted by her in the same March dispute, according to court filings obtained by CNN.Jabbari was arrested in New York City in October on suspicion of assault and criminal mischief stemming from Majors’ countersuit, but a spokesperson for the Manhattan DA’s Office told CNN in a statement that the DA has declined to prosecute the case against Jabbari “because it lacks prosecutorial merit.”Last month, a judge denied Majors’ motion to dismiss the assault case.Jabbari and her attorney have not publicly commented on the case.Majors’ attorney Priya Chaudhry denied the allegations against him in a statement to CNN in August, adding that Majors “has had his life, career, and reputation torn apart” as a result of the charges.CNN reported in October that Disney has removed “Magazine Dreams,” an upcoming film starring Majors that was due out on December 8, from its release calendar. He was also reportedly dropped by his PR and management teams in the wake of the allegations.Majors was featured in “Ant-Man: Quantumania” as one of the the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s next major villains, and has portrayed a version of the character over both seasons of the Disney+ Marvel series “Loki.”The character, known as Kang, is also currently set to be featured in two upcoming “Avengers” sequels for Marvel, scheduled in 2026 and 2027.The trial is expected to last several days.CNN’s Dan Heching, Marianne Garvey and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.",2352,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/entertainment/jonathan-majors-trial-begins/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,aggravate lack month version kang universe expect judge contribute criminal schedule grace prosecutorial chaudhry torn dispute december currently grant assault obtain jonathan portrayed limited feature dream result character attorney allegation york comment begin series stem order priya magazine villain garvey season june life add calendar management manhattan statement protection motion told reputation prohibit dismiss countersuit publicly team wake film avenger file due put charge plead guilty spokesperson neck remove former kristina district harassment cnn bruising cinematic sgueglia prosecute hand accord involve complaint court marvel filing major deny city release decline marianne report mischief claim upcoming recognizance struck ear october case disney laceration career arrest sequel actor star jabbari trial set suspicion pain august drop contact girlfriend reportedly pr office march quantumania open heching wednesday initial substantial domestic,-0.98515,0.0,10.910533642691412,0.3102597402597402,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,Thurston Moore disappears into the cool noise of his memoir,2023-11-29 08:30:00,Chris Richards,"Before social media made everyone needy and uncool, there used to be this thing called mystique — and you could often find it radiating from this other thing called rock-and-roll. In his 1970s suburban Connecticut adolescence, Thurston Moore became obsessed with both, studying his Stooges and Captain Beefheart records, trying to learn the ways in which shy weirdos transformed themselves into heroic mystery-freaks, until he eventually pulled the whole trick off himself, co-founding one of the coolest bands to ever exist.Sonic Youth isn’t the most unknowable entity in the greater constellation of American rock stars. The band didn’t swap identities like David Bowie or live inside a purple fog like Prince. But everything mysterious about Moore’s era-defining group remains so, within the pages of his recent memoir, “Sonic Life.” The book is overflowing with eye-and-ear-witnessed thrills. But when it comes to the internal stuff — disappointments, regrets, failure, grief — Moore tends to vanish in a puff of smoke. Even on the book’s cover, he’s hiding beneath his signature blonde shag and a spritz of cartoon lightning bolts.At first, “Sonic Life” is a tale about a young fan’s mind getting blown so many times that his participation in the grand mystery of rock-and-roll becomes a foregone conclusion. Venturing into the New York shadows at every opportunity, Moore recounts getting his molecular structure routinely rearranged by live performances from Blondie, the Ramones, Television, Talking Heads, and especially Patti Smith, his hero and lodestar. Even back then, Moore says he knew he’d infiltrated “an exclusive space, experiencing the greatest music being made in the Western world.” He remembers the assaultive synth-n-vocals duo Suicide as “horror movie noise and Beach Boys melodies channeled through nightmares,” and the punky sex-kitsch of the Cramps as “trash action.”The lyricism of his recollections shouldn’t surprise anyone. Check out how he describes the city itself: “At the tip of Manhattan, where the island narrows to a pointed spear, the streets lose their manicured grid and smash into one another, overlapping into madness.” Lovely. But also, sad. With only those traffic patterns surviving today, Moore’s nightlife testimony becomes a memorial to the lost petri dish of a downtown scene that made Sonic Youth possible.Moore’s knack for being in the right places at the right times extends into the 1980s after he finally met bassist-guitarist Kim Gordon and formed Sonic Youth, a band that quickly came to represent a convergence of no-wave noise, hardcore punk and high art. In 1986, the band signed to the legendary West Coast punk label SST Records, then in 1990, made the major label leap to DGC, by which time they’d become a portal between the underground and the mainstream through which all cool things must pass.But even as Sonic Youth caught the public’s ear, he remained preoccupied by neighboring frequencies. After attending his first Nirvana gig at Maxwell’s in Hoboken, N.J., circa 1989, Moore was an especially overwhelmed portal attendant, convinced he’d just seen “the seeds of the coming decade. It was going to be more than just cheap thrills, offering instead a radical reconsideration of musical expression at large. … That movement’s progressive, troubled spirit would largely reside behind the glassy blue eyes of Kurt Cobain, anointed as if by some lost angel, an artist destined to shine, scorched and exquisite, if only for a fleeting moment.”Does Moore understand Nirvana better than he understands Sonic Youth? He rarely touches on his own band’s social impact or spiritual meaning — but he is willing to explain its creative mechanics, describing a “sonic democracy” in which “the only method was to listen, feel, reveal, and refine.” He knows how great it all sounded, too, capturing the generational resonance of his clanging guitar strings in two perfect words — “electric bells.”What emerges beneath the noise, though, might be a picture of loneliness — something hinted at early in the action when Moore describes landing a vinyl copy of the Stooges debut album: “It would become my best friend.” Moore’s decades-long bandmates Lee Ranaldo and Steve Shelley hardly appear in these pages. He describes his partnership with Gordon in more detail, but without effusion. The most memorable thing about the couple’s wedding day is the fact that Moore wore a T-shirt for the Maryland hardcore band Void.Is that mystique? Or obfuscation? Every Sonic Youth fan knows how the band fell apart in 2011 after Moore’s affair with book editor Eva Prinz destroyed his marriage with Gordon. Near the end of “Sonic Life,” Moore finally addresses the fallout as if reciting a statement drafted by his lawyer: “The circumstances that led me to a place where I would even consider such an extreme and difficult decision — to leave my marriage to Kim, my partner and bandmate of almost thirty years, the mother of our child, the adored aunt to my nieces and nephews — are intensely personal, and I would never capitalize on them publicly, here or anywhere.”Earlier, he writes, “Kim and I were aware of how our marriage positioned us as parental figures of a sort to some of the younger musicians we met” — not to mention the entirety of Sonic Youth’s young fan base. These two were among the most iconic couples in rock history, leading an important band that everyone assumed would last forever. Moore knows all of this, right? He must. But if he really is hiding out in the pages of his own memoir, let’s hope it’s not to protect our collective ideas about the sanctity of his art.

CNN,The Japanese photographer celebrating community in rural America,2023-11-29 07:47:00,not specified,"“I never really paid attention to politics before the 2016 election,” confided Japanese photographer Fumi Nagasaka over video call. Nagasaka moved to New York in 2002, witnessing two Obama wins before Trump’s divisive election victory seven years ago. “When it happened I just thought, ‘Okay, this country is falling apart’. Everybody started to be angry.”Nagasaka’s concern then was about her practice: Leaving Japan for the United States had provided her with a sense of freedom to explore creative pathways she felt were otherwise limited. “In the US, it didn’t seem to matter what kind of education you had, as long you had talent and knowledge you had opportunities,” she said. In the aughts she began shooting American street style photography for a Japanese magazine, which would ultimately shape her more personal, culture-focused work. “I wasn’t confident with my English, but photography became a tool for me to meet people,” she explained.Harnessing this sentiment, Nagasaka subsequently undertook a series of long-term projects examining adolescence across America, Japan, Canada and Europe, publishing the books “Untitled Youth” in 2016, “Teenage Riot” two years later, and in 2022, “Marching Wolves”. In 2017, incentivised by the election result and curious to rectify her unfamiliarity with the American South, she made the first of many trips that would become her new monograph, “Dora, Yerkwood, Walker County, Alabama.”Travelling to Dora, a town of approximately 2,300 people, with her New York neighbor Tanya Rouse (a native of Alabama, her daughter had been one of Nagasaka’s earlier subjects), the photographer quickly became privy to the contrasts between New York City and the social and physical characteristics of the wider country. “I’d been to Los Angeles and San Francisco, but I’d never really been to a small rural town,” she recalled.“I met some great people,” she continued. “It was Halloween and homecoming, so there were football games, a parade, a dance — it was the biggest event in town, so I photographed it.” She and Rouse decided then to return every year around the same time, and the new book is a rich and intimate document of their six years moving around the county.Using a heavy duty, medium format camera however, Nagasaka’s presence initially garnered skepticism. While teens loosened when she shared her Instagram handle and they could trace her portfolio, others were harder to reassure. To remedy this, she contacted the local newspaper. “Everybody reads it, so we reached out about my project and an article came out. People started to understand what I did then, and I expanded the project.”While working on the series in 2020, Nagasaka took on a separate commission to document the presidential election, an experience that further highlighted a gulf in the attitudes of the friends she had made and those back in New York, as well as compelling her to confront the disparities between the racial groups she encountered.“Trump supporters were easy to find in Dora, they wore Trump hats and had Trump flags, but the Biden supporters were difficult. Nobody was putting signs up,” she remembered. “It was during Covid and in Yerkwood (a predominantly Black area south of Dora), nobody was outside. We knocked on doors, because I had photographed some people the year before, and were told that if they put signs outside, people would steal them.”In the book itself, there are no images of flags or explicit references to politics, despite its role in the book’s genesis, having spurred Nagasaka’s initial intrigue in the South and the way politics reverberates in communities. As the photographer acknowledges in the book’s afterward, “Many people, including those who live there, sometimes associate the South with poverty and rural blight, and while it is undeniable that those things exist, what I found in Walker County was beautiful, charming and full of love.”Instead, “Dora, Yerkwood, Walker County, Alabama” examines the human condition, employing the camera as a device to witness moments of joy and celebration, as well as quiet and tenderness. “This project changed my life and the way I see things, and this book is my love letter to the community,” asserted Nagasaka, whose care and warmth for the people she met is plain throughout.“I didn’t want to bring politics into the project,” she continued, alluding to the book’s final form and the comfort she subsequently found in Walker County. “Even though that was happening in the town, I left it outside. I’m not a photojournalist, I’m an artist, and I was focused on celebrating this beautiful town.” Any political noise then, the viewer brings themselves, but what ultimately reads most prominently in the images is a sense of intimacy, extended from the community to Nagasaka and reciprocated in the work.“Dora, Yerkwood, Walker County, Alabama” by Fumi Nagasaka is published by GOST Books and out now.",4919,https://www.cnn.com/style/fumi-nagasaka-photography-rural-america/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,garner flag rouse japanese america monograph image leave intimacy remedy project social contrast dora separate sentiment moment shoot photograph south united tool final american obama role politics handle make sign great year canada disparity matter back commission viewer freedom result medium reciprocate explore witness characteristic initially include small photography political quickly approximately presence change ultimately expand europe portfolio explicit shape format form wore time election instagram steal reference focus youth letter blight untitled comfort joy wider game style dance find highlight physical start rectify paid long big decide japan provide angeles unfamiliarity divisive call community football celebrate city newspaper read move personal share love gulf camera meet associate easy reverberates supporter confide artist undertook duty street trip san event adolescence afterward continued document genesis compelling contact happen found incentivised predominantly extend english full fall pathway device initial francisco bring reassure privy win confident left knowledge homecoming subject instead plain heavy racial difficult quiet practice rich creative photojournalist country trace limited state book parade harder employ york biden understand begin gost kind series magazine allude assert celebration knock work publishing life examine ago brings travel told felt town poverty wolf prominently intrigue victory intimate confront despite beautiful loosen put fumi live experience friend attention trump reach exist opportunity native remember noise undeniable publish daughter riot examines return video black charm tenderness subsequently spur aught county earlier neighbor local concern rural group yerkwood curious talent teenage covid area nagasaka warmth march human walker acknowledges photographer condition article halloween alabama education attitude presidential skepticism,0.9965,0.1219760113844277,8.303119266055045,0.4060762702210072,0,2023-11-29

Washington Post,It’s never too late to lift weights: Older bodies can still build muscle,2023-11-29 07:00:00,Gretchen Reynolds,"Contrary to popular wisdom among many gym-goers and even some scientists, healthy people in their 60s, 70s and beyond can safely start lifting weights and rapidly build substantial muscle mass, strength and mobility.A new study of resistance exercise and the elderly found that even people in their 80s and 90s — who hadn’t weight trained before — showed significant gains after starting a supervised program of lifting weights three times a week.“It shows that healthy older people can certainly respond to resistance training, that their muscles are still plastic,” said Tommy Lundberg, an exercise researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, who was not involved in the study.Lundberg, the author of the new book, “The Physiology of Resistance Training,” said the research shows it’s never to late for older people to start lifting weights. “They can increase both their muscle size and their strength,” he said.Most of all, the study implies that our perceptions of what’s physically possible in old age also may need updating.“It is often assumed that the oldest old, or, say, people past the age of 80, are less likely to be able to gain muscle mass and strength,” said Luc van Loon, a professor of human biology at Maastricht University, and senior author of the new study.This idea took hold partly because the oldest old so rarely were studied. Past weight-training research often capped volunteers’ ages at about 75, because of worries that older people would be unable to handle the training or that their muscles wouldn’t respond if they could manage to lift.But van Loon and his colleagues were unconvinced. “Muscle tissue is constantly turning over as long as we live,” he said, so why shouldn’t an octogenarian’s muscles strengthen and grow as well as a youngster’s of 65?To investigate that idea, he and his co-authors recruited 29 healthy, older men and women. The study consisted of two groups. The “younger old” included 17 people between the ages of 65 and 75. Participants in the “older old” group were at least 85. All lived independently and had no debilitating illnesses.None had regularly weight trained before.The researchers measured everyone’s current strength and muscle mass and then introduced them to weight training, with a basic full-body resistance routine using gym machines such as the lat pulldown and leg extension. The volunteers lifted three times a week for 12 weeks, in supervised sessions, using weights set to as much as 80 percent of their full strength.This program is more intense than some people might expect older people to tolerate. But the volunteers “loved participating in this intervention,” said Gabriel Nasri Marzuca-Nassr, an associate professor at the University of La Frontera in Chile, who led the new study. Attendance was high, injuries rare.And both the “younger old” and “older old” groups responded powerfully to the exercise, surprising the researchers somewhat. Before the study started, Marzuca-Nassr said, he and his co-authors had expected the oldest men and women to gain strength and mass, but to a lesser extent than among the 65- to 75-year-olds.However, after three months, the people aged 85 and up had packed on more strength and mass, in relative terms, than the younger group, adding an average of 11 percent to muscle mass and 46 percent to strength, versus 10 percent more muscle and 38 percent more strength among the younger volunteers.The oldest men and women also improved their scores on a test of their ability to rise from a chair and move around by about 13 percent, versus 8 percent in the younger of the groups.The oldest group’s greater relative gains were due, in part, the researchers think, to their having had an extra decade of declining muscle size and strength, compared to the younger lifters. They started from a lower baseline.The results persuasively show that “it’s never too late to start training,” said Michael Roberts, a professor of kinesiology at Auburn University in Alabama, who has extensively studied resistance exercise.The oldest group’s improved mobility was especially encouraging, he added, because “loss of physical function is ultimately what defines frailty.”The results have caveats. The study was small and lasted only for three months. Plus, the training was supervised, with people’s lifting form and loads monitored and adjusted as needed, a level of attention that could be difficult to replicate for ordinary people.The study also is not meant to give any of us carte blanche to skip weight training now, in anticipation of starting in retirement. “It’s better to start at an earlier age,” Marzuca-Nassr said, “and continue throughout life.”Perhaps most important, the older men and women who joined the study were healthy for their ages, with few glaring physical limitations. It may be unrealistic for some older people with serious illnesses or disabilities to begin lifting.If you’re worried about your readiness for weight training, Marzuca-Nassr said, talk with your doctor.Anyone past about age 60 who’s interested in starting a new lifting or other exercise routine should probably check first with their doctor and then seek out training programs at a gym or community center specifically designed for older people. The costs often are covered by Medicare or other insurance.The study’s key takeaway, though, is that there seems to be no age limit or hard stop on our bodies’ ability to adapt and improve, said study co-author van Loon. “You are never too old to start exercising.”",5527,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/29/weight-lifting-aging/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,unconvinced michael improve participant resistance program regularly possible extent independently loss significant chile extensively handle check rise center worried investigate tissue important great level result researcher scientist part interested turn rapidly takeaway routine packed include small versus defines assume auburn ultimately volunteer octogenarian late pulldown strength form time woman due especially readiness wisdom partly loon powerfully unable mass luc train physical start long extension involve continue community institute move strengthen love author safely muscle associate frontera ability score current blanche replicate perception machine past gym probably attendance capped encourage set lesser idea measure medicare nasri found monitor load talk limitation size lifter exercise intervention unrealistic full substantial session university relative physically meant lat month doctor expect colleague skip extra high seek difficult percent elderly robert leg cost stop limit physiology kinesiology function book hard supervise contrary weight worry begin maastricht specifically popular tolerate age biology training add lift design retirement research cover healthy hold karolinska persuasively recruit young give tommy live gabriel debilitate attention sweden implies plastic injury build intense introduce test lundberg mobility low lead consist decline show ordinary professor adapt average carte decade illness caveat respond anticipation term senior grow glare disability earlier week chair basic compare join constantly group body key adjust youngster surprising increase human study manage rarely alabama participate,0.988,0.2171159761172426,9.807900287631828,0.4202869194297766,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,Guitarist Anthony Pirog enlisted friends and heroes for ambient album,2023-11-29 06:00:00,not specified,"Over the years, Anthony Pirog has pressed his virtuosic guitar playing into service in a variety of forms. He’s helmed trios, sextets and ensembles; he’s been part of the duo Janel & Anthony with his wife, Janel Leppin, and the Messthetics with Fugazi veterans Brendan Canty and Joe Lally; he’s even conducted a rendition of Terry Riley’s minimalist masterpiece “In C.”As a solo artist, the Pennsylvania-born, D.C.-based musician is not limited by genre: His 2014 album “Palo Colorado Dream” took jazz forms into wide-ranging directions, and “TM,” recorded in July 2020, transmuted the unease and fear of the peak pandemic period into harsh noise.For his latest album, “The Nepenthe Series Vol. 1,” Pirog decided to explore ambient music. Reaching out to a host of musicians that he’s met and communicated with over the years, he asked each collaborator for an original piece of music that he could perform over. Once Andy Summers of the Police signed on, Pirog knew he was on to something.“I just started asking people, and everyone said yes,” he says. “Some of them I’m married to, and some of them are good local friends, and some of them are my heroes. So the whole thing was really exciting.”While Pirog requested “ambient” submissions — quote marks his — he didn’t give any other instructions, leaving it up to each collaborator to interpret the catchall descriptor and challenging himself to figure out how to respond musically.“I just wanted to really honor the fact that they took the time to do this and make something that I felt was worth listening to,” he says. “As far as it being in the ambient genre, I really just wanted it to be calming, for the most part, kind of a static, flowing thing.”“The Nepenthe Series Vol. 1” will be the dual focus of a forthcoming record release show that also celebrates Leppin’s first solo cello album, “The Brink.”Leppin produced Pirog’s album, which is more in line with the sorrow-salving drug of Greek mythology referenced by its title than Pirog’s often-confrontational music or the “totally blazing guitar party” one might expect from an album that features the likes of John Frusciante, Nels Cline and Luke Stewart. Pirog credits Leppin with helping him to decide which directions to take his musical responses.“She’s really the only person I trust,” Pirog says. “She said, ‘You know, this is probably what people need right now.’”",2386,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/29/anthony-pirog-concert-dc/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,worth hero host listen expect leave guitar press brendan produce vol pandemic solo nels stewart joe party make colorado sign year minimalist calm transmute limited instruction dream dual feature andy communicate blazing descriptor duo fear piece explore john part series kind person palo original genre messthetics pirog credit riley perform late request figure helm period mark canty felt leppin form anthony conduct musician police time totally frusciante honor give focus reference friend flow reach masterpiece trust ambient interpret luke unease tm celebrates virtuosic start decide jazz rendition forthcoming july variety greek trio release music sextet show catchall married musical mythology static cline play cello respond lally summer service knew artist janel probably terry local harsh ensemble line veteran wife direction fact fugazi title album quote submission collaborator nepenthe challenge peak record,0.98545,0.1257334450963956,6.882315369261477,0.4828483245149912,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,"After 30 years, hardcore legends Scream return to D.C. with new music",2023-11-29 06:00:00,not specified,"The members of Scream conceived their new album, their first studio record in 30 years, as a historical document. But as the title “D.C. Special” suggests, the project doesn’t celebrate just the local hardcore punk quartet.“We wanted to tell our story as a band through our community and the music that shaped us over the years,” explains singer Pete Stahl by phone from Los Angeles. He and his brother, Scream guitarist Franz Stahl, have lived in LA since the group imploded on tour more than three decades ago. (The band’s 1993 album, “Fumble,” was actually recorded in 1989.)“D.C. Special” features the lineup that made Scream’s first three albums: the Stahl siblings, bassist Enoch “Skeeter” Thompson and drummer Kent Stax. (The percussionist, whose given name was Bennett Kent Stacks, died because of cancer in September.) But those four are joined by many guests.Most of the supplementary musicians are fellow veterans of 1980s D.C. punk bands. But Pete also enlisted people from earlier local groups, such as Razz lead singer Michael Reidy, original Slickee Boys vocalist Martha Hull, and drummer Bob Berberich, who played in Grin (with Nils Lofgren). Before that, Berberich was a member of the Hangmen, who from 1964 to 1967 were Washington’s closest thing to the Beatles.“They were a huge influence on me and my brother,” says Pete of the Hangmen. The preteen Stahl brothers saw the band perform because it was co-managed by the kids’ father, Arnold Stahl.The bulk of “D.C. Special” was recorded at the local punk scene’s favorite studio, Don Zientara’s Inner Ear, in September 2021. The Arlington studio closed soon after, displaced by redevelopment.“It added to a celebratory kind of feeling for the record,” Pete recalls. “As people found out we were recording at Don’s, and that Don’s was closing, they were coming by just to see the studio before it closed.”“It became a big hang and set the tone for the record. There was a joy there of coming together, and all playing together and reminding ourselves what we’re about.”One of the people who showed up was the most famous former Scream member, the Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl, the band’s drummer from 1986 to 1990.“He ended up hanging out for a few days, and I think he really enjoyed it,” Pete says. “He plays a little on one song.”“D.C. Special” arrived in early November, more than two years after the Inner Ear sessions. The delay was largely due to backlogs at the vinyl pressing plant, Pete reports, but also because of difficulties in mixing the tracks.Scream kept working in the interim, recording two more songs, “Smile and Bleed” and “Politics Is Entertainment,” in the summer of 2023. There are 12 songs on the vinyl release, and it comes with a download code for six more numbers.The newest recordings feature D.C. drummer Scott Garrett, who played with Scream on a summer European tour. “We wanted to get him on the record, because he was playing with us at the time,” Pete says.Scream’s current drummer is Jerry Busher, who’s probably best known for serving as Fugazi’s second percussionist in that band’s later years.

(There’s even one designed for the littlest revelers.)Gimme Gimme Disco: A Dance Party Inspired by Abba at 9:30 ClubDespite the name, this roving dance party, which has visited 9:30 Club on multiple occasions, plays more than the Swedish quartet — expect the Bee Gees, Chic and Donna Summer, among others. Disco attire is encouraged. 9 p.m. 930.com. $55.Emmet Swimming at the AtlantisBack in the 1990s, Emmet Swimming — a Fairfax quartet who parlayed wry lyrics and alternative roots-rock into a major-label deal — were fixtures at 9:30 Club, even recording a live album there.

(7 and 9 p.m. $79-$109.) Over in the Concert Hall, Gregory Porter performs songs from his new holiday album “Christmas Wish” as well as the soulful, gospel-influenced jazz that has made him one of the most popular singers in the genre.

Washington Post,Elon Musk’s embrace of Israel unlikely to ease X’s advertiser concerns,2023-11-29 06:00:00,Will Oremus,"Facing an exodus of advertisers over concerns of antisemitism on his social media site X, billionaire Elon Musk has gone to great lengths to align himself with Israel — 7,000 miles, in fact.That’s the approximate distance Musk traveled Monday to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and tour a kibbutz ravaged in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. He also reportedly agreed that SpaceX, his space exploration company, would not provide Starlink satellite internet service to Gaza without the Israeli government’s approval.It was the latest salvo in a campaign by Musk to counter allegations of rampant antisemitism on his platform — including his own amplification of antisemitic tropes — by positioning himself as a staunch supporter of the Jewish state. But the moves drew mixed reactions from Jewish organizations, and so far there are few indications that they’re winning back advertisers.If anything, “he’s digging himself deeper and deeper into the ground,” said Ruben Schreurs, chief strategy officer at the marketing consultancy Ebiquity.Just over a year after Musk acquired Twitter, pledging to make it a haven for free speech and subsequently laying off much of its workforce, its advertising business is on the ropes. Reports of spiking hate speech on the platform; Musk’s decision to prioritize the posts of paying subscribers over those of journalists and media outlets; and his own trollish, sometimes incendiary posts have sparked advertiser boycotts, while other brands and influential users backed away. Those include The Washington Post, which said Tuesday that it had paused advertising on X.This month, a report by the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters found pro-Nazi tweets running next to major brands’ ads on X. That came on the heels of Musk personally endorsing a tweet that echoed a baseless antisemitic accusation popular with white nationalists.The result was a backlash in which some of X’s largest remaining advertisers, including IBM, Apple and Disney, announced that they would pause their spending on the site. Musk responded by suing Media Matters, alleging defamation — and by dramatically ramping up his public support of Israel.On Nov. 17, as the list of companies pulling their ads grew, Musk tweeted that certain phrases associated with calls for Palestinian liberation from Israel, including “decolonization” and “from the river to the sea,” necessarily imply “genocide” and that anyone using them on X would be suspended. It was a sharp departure from his usual rhetoric about the importance of tolerating objectionable speech.At least one prominent Jewish leader appeared mollified. Jonathan Greenblatt, president of the Anti-Defamation League, which had sparred with Musk in the past, called the crackdown “important and welcome” and praised Musk’s “leadership in fighting hate.”Next, Musk turned to a now-familiar ally in Netanyahu. Twice before, Musk has spoken with Netanyahu at the height of controversies over his dalliances with antisemitism — once in June after tweets about the Jewish financier George Soros, and again in September amid Musk’s feud with the ADL. The pair had broadcast their September conversation using X’s live audio feature, called Spaces, and they did the same this week in Israel.The alliance appears to have paid off for Netanyahu already, as Musk agreed in “principle” to give the Israeli government control over the use of Starlink internet service in Gaza. While the service could be critical to Palestinian aid efforts crippled by widespread communication blackouts, Israeli leaders fear that it would be used by Hamas militants.But Musk’s hopes that people would get the message that he’s not an antisemite after all — “Actions speak louder than words,” he tweeted — remained largely unfulfilled.“We are glad Elon Musk went to Israel, and we encourage every leader to visit to try and grasp the horrific pain inflicted by Hamas against the Jewish state and, in turn, against the Jewish people,” Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said in an emailed statement to The Post. “And yet, as recently as last week, we were outraged by Musk’s amplification of antisemitic content on X. His experience in Israel should cause him to remove antisemitic content on X rather than promote it. We’ll see.”Elad Nehorai, a left-leaning commentator who has helped to organize a campaign by rabbis and other Jewish leaders to call out antisemitism on X, saw Musk’s meetings with Netanyahu as a “symbiotic relationship, where they both benefit from each other.” Musk gets “a shield against antisemitism accusations,” while Netanyahu gets the support of the world’s richest man, and one of its most powerful, thanks to his ownership of Starlink.But Nehorai said Musk’s support of Israel shouldn’t absolve him of responsibility for failing to moderate antisemitism on X, or for Musk’s own antisemitic tweets. “This has been a classic move by Republicans and the right for a long time: The moment they get accused of antisemitism, they state their support of Israel,” he said.Nehorai added that some antisemites and white nationalists see support of a Jewish state as consistent with their own interest in marginalizing Jews and other minorities domestically. The tweet that Musk agreed with this month was making the case that “western Jewish populations” are to blame for supporting “hordes of minorities” who are “flooding their country” and promoting “hatred against whites.”It’s too soon to say for sure whether Musk’s Israel visit will help his cause with advertisers, said Schreurs of Ebiquity, which he said consults with more than 70 of the 100 largest advertising spenders globally. If his goal was to put to rest their concerns about spending on X, Schreurs added, it could have the opposite effect.“What brands at all costs try to avoid in general is overly politicized content,” he said. “What he’s doing now with this abundant show of reverence to Netanyahu and support for his regime is actually further politicizing the platform.”",6028,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/29/elon-musk-israel-antisemitism-starlink/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,billionaire incendiary run leader minority antisemite company ted strategy organize adl politicize post ceo nehorai palestinian decolonization social promote moment spar announce gaza american rampant make spark brand boycott important great year israel dramatically back matter hatred feature medium result principle exploration fear horrific length outrage personally turn internet greenblatt include platform ground recently site ramp objectionable salvo government reverence acquire late pledge statement amid western heel usual distance drew remain pull spacex ally time domestically goal endorse commentator george accusation ruben ibm genocide netanyahu absolve officer richest moderate financier paid long message provide approximate call cripple mollify spoken move ravage pair rope rest subscriber report mile israeli meet associate feud allege supporter pause imply past organization service river decision welcome hamas influential antisemites encourage amplification spender controversy hate globally horde pain monday attack meeting consults benjamin height departure grasp pay defamation found accuse symbiotic action x musk jewish outlet space league satellite speech free email shield responsibility month starlink opposite win prominent mixed population classic counter rhetoric interest lay republican tweet louder cost backlash spike importance elad crackdown dalliance baseless jonathan away country broadcast ownership state consultancy deutch liberation large effort campaign allegation exodus president trope workforce washington popular tolerate relationship prioritize june ebiquity add marketing jew powerful trollish echoed travel staunch blackout conversation communication elon overly advertising kibbutz watchdog nationalist antisemitism largely agree give put business necessarily soros live minister experience antisemitic spending flood tour general aid remove committee prime blame fail praise inflict alliance phrase list word twitter world visit major public journalist audio regime consistent show marginalize user benefit subsequently tuesday respond sharp case disney avoid grow critical suspend glad advertiser control week white apple reaction concern leadership chief september hope rabbi indication content reportedly position fight widespread deeper abundant support speak align schreurs,0.9747,0.099535500995355,10.422345568487016,0.4388835978835978,0,2023-11-29
CNN,Gucci staff strike over plans to relocate to Milan,2023-11-29 05:34:00,Christy Choi,"Dozens of employees at Italian fashion house Gucci staged a strike on Monday to protest the company’s decision to move its design office from Rome to Milan.Although a Gucci spokesperson told CNN the proposed relocation “does not involve any staff reductions,” a regional branch of labor union CGIL described the move as “disguised collective redundancy.”Writing on its website last week, the union said the move “conceals the desire to soon cease all activity in Rome.” A later post was accompanied by photos from Monday’s demonstration in Rome, where protesters held placards with messages including “Gucci cuts but doesn’t sew.”The decision, which the company said it communicated to unions in October, affects 153 of the design office’s 219 Rome-based employees. CGIL has argued that asking staff to move to Milan, approximately 300 miles north of the capital, in the first half of 2024 was tantamount to laying them off.Gucci’s spokesperson said that the relocation means its creative director and designers will “have the opportunity to collaborate closely with the strategic functions of the company” already based in Milan, “maximizing the necessary interactions and synergies.”The statement added that the brand is offering “economic incentives and active support …more favorable than those stipulated in the Italian national collective agreement.”Following the departure of creative director Alessandro Michele in 2022, Gucci owner Kering shook up the label’s top management. The company appointed former Valentino designer Sabato De Sarno as its new creative director in January this year, while in August, Kering announced that CEO Marco Bizzarri was leaving the company, putting Jean-François Palus, who previously served as Kering’s managing director, in the top job.Kering, which also owns Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, said at the time Palus was “tasked with strengthening Gucci’s teams and operations” to rebuild the Italian brand’s “influence and momentum.”Gucci is Kering’s largest brand, accounting for just over half of the French conglomerate’s $22 billion revenue last year.While sales of luxury goods were on a tear earlier in the year, the market cooled in the second half of 2023. Following three years of bumper profits fueled by pent-up consumer demand post pandemic, Kering reported a larger-than-expected 9% drop in sales last quarter, underperforming its rivals amid a slowing appetite for high-end clothing and accessories.With De Sarno at the helm, Gucci unveiled a new collection dubbed “Gucci Ancora” (an Italian word that means both “still” and “again”) in September to a star-studded crowd in Milan including Julia Roberts, Ryan Gosling, Jessica Chastain, Kendall Jenner and Julia Garner.The designer gave the old Gucci codes a refresh sending babydoll dresses, tailored short suits, fringed skirts, hoodies and bejeweled knitwear down the runway.",2904,https://www.cnn.com/style/gucci-staff-strike-relocation-milan-rome/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,fashion appoint sabato sarno maximize company strike desire activity billion bizzarri cut demonstration rival leave post ceo runway pandemic union capital lay announce jenner demand robert creative chastain rome stag brand michele shook year tear refresh fuel disguise function laurent offering communicate milan alessandro gucci large hoodies valentino julia ryan active include send bumper cgil protester national base accounting approximately north employee add house stipulate design balenciaga management influence helm cool statement collective director told serve amid team affect quarter ancora collaborate time palus economic kering put label closely relocation tasked give yves propose skirt spokesperson cease former website veneta operation crowd jessica cnn consumer tantamount dubbed involve unveiled message half opportunity accompany regional word reduction argue interaction move strengthen previously january french report mile clothing appetite code protest follow favorable conceals bottega tailor october described conglomerate kendall gosling short decision labor dozen earlier week held placard italian slow babydoll profit marco dress august drop strategic monday september suit rebuild branch designer departure owner revenue underperform office luxury photo staff support write manage collection top fringe knitwear market incentive saint bejewel,0.96475,0.0,11.541596958174903,0.3029690847872666,0,2023-11-29
NPR,"This 3-year cruise around the world is called off, leaving passengers in the lurch",2023-11-29 05:01:00,Bill Chappell,"They were promised the world. But cruise company Life at Sea recently told customers who bought passage on a three-year voyage that rather than visiting 140 countries, their trip was called off. Those customers are now scrambling to make new plans for where they will live for the next three years — and to extract refunds from the cruise line. The intense fallout is drawing comparisons to infamous debacles such as the Fyre Festival — the ""luxury"" music festival that was more like a ""disaster relief area."" Here's what to know about the cruise around the world that was called off The original itinerary mapped 1,095 days of travel, heading from Istanbul to Europe and then to South America and the Caribbean. Passengers would then pass through the Panama Canal before seeing the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska and then head west across the Pacific. ""We are going to be following summer the entire time that we go around the world,"" then-Life at Sea CEO Kendra Holmes told prospective passengers in a Zoom webinar in September. Voyagers were to see seven continents, visiting 140 countries. They would spend roughly 300 days at sea, 795 days at port and have 413 overnight port stays, Chief Operating Officer Ethem Bayramoglu of Miray Cruises, the Turkish parent company of Life at Sea, said in that online session. Along the way, they would explore wonders of the world, visit UNESCO World Heritage sites and have plentiful chances to go diving and snorkeling, the company said. The three-year voyage was to begin on Nov. 1, departing from Istanbul. Some passengers reportedly only learned of the cancellation after arriving in Turkey. When the cruise missed its planned departure date, the company promised to resolve lingering issues. But after further delays, the trip was canceled. ""Still waiting for my refund. And now you've gone belly up?"" a woman who identified herself as a Life at Sea customer said on the company's Instagram account. The woman, a retired educator, did not respond to NPR's message seeking further comment. Former flight attendant Meredith Shay was looking forward to the trip as a centerpiece of her retirement. ""How did I feel about it?"" Shay said in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America. ""Devastated, disappointed, sad. I packed up my belongings, put them in storage, sent four boxes to Miray Cruises."" A wide range of passengers had seemingly booked cabins. ""The age group is split pretty much between 35 and 85"" years old, and the passengers included a large number of Americans, Holmes said. The cheapest packages started at $196,000 for a single traveler, and $231,000 for couples, according to the company's website. Costs ranged much higher for guests staying in premium rooms. In exchange, passengers — or residents, as the company called them — were promised a long list of amenities, including an onboard hospital and doctor. Some cabins could host cats; travelers were also promised high-speed internet, free dining, alcohol and laundry service, and ""enrichment seminars."" Terms of the deal help illuminate the would-be passengers' financial and logistical plight. Life at Sea set initial deposits at 30% of the overall cost. Under its 12-month payment plan, the first draw came due one month ahead of the sail date. And rather than portioning the cruise for sale in smaller stages, the company required customers to commit to the full three years. ""Our residents are changing their lives for this opportunity, and we are honored to be a part of their personal journeys,"" Holmes said in June. ""In two days' time, we own this vessel,"" Life at Sea itinerary planner Robert Dixon said in late September, speaking in a promotional video from the bridge of a ship he called the ""MV Lara."" But the company wasn't able to close that deal, and the ship in question — the 20-year-old AIDAaura — was instead sold in November to Celestyal, which specializes in Mediterranean cruises. Miray's attempts to purchase the ship dragged on for weeks, and it eventually stalled after investors balked, according to a company message obtained by CNN and other outlets. ""If you're focused on the ship, this is not the journey for you,"" Holmes said in the September webinar. But two months later, she would leave her leadership post at Life at Sea and Miray, as plans for the ambitious cruise unraveled. Holmes was trying to allay concerns about the quality of the vessel. But it seems that it was the company's focus, not the public's, that was the problem. Warning flags went up earlier this year, when the company changed course from its initial plan to refit one of its ships, the MV Gemini. For the lengthy worldwide voyage, it planned to deploy the larger ""MV Lara"" — a ship that never materialized. It's complicated. On Sunday, Miray Cruises issued a statement in Turkish, denying that the cruise is canceled. Instead, the company said the voyage is postponed — and it blamed a lack of enough passenger bookings, rather than problems finding an appropriate ship.

NPR,Three hospitals ignored her gravely ill fiancé. Then a young doctor stepped in,2023-11-29 05:01:00,Brigid McCarthy,"The photo from David and Sarah Lubarsky's wedding announcement in Feb. 1984. David Lubarsky hide caption The photo from David and Sarah Lubarsky's wedding announcement in Feb. 1984. This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain team. It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else. Forty years ago, Sarah Lubarsky came home from work and realized that her fiancé, David, was extremely ill. He was vomiting and slurring his words. So she grabbed her purse and took him by taxi to the nearest hospital, on the Lower East Side of New York City. The minutes slowly passed as they waited to see a doctor. ""We sat there for a couple of hours, and it was pretty clear that nobody was going to pay attention to him,"" Lubarsky recalled. So they rushed to a second hospital, where Lubarsky says they were also ignored. But she knew something was very wrong with David. So they went to a third hospital. As she told the receptionist what was happening, she sensed the person wasn't going to treat their case with urgency. Lubarsky was becoming frantic. After three failed attempts to get help, she had reached her limit. She started to make a scene in the lobby. That's when her unsung hero appeared. ""All of a sudden, this person comes up to me and says, 'How can I help you? What's going on here?'"" Lubarsky said. All she remembers is that the man was young, with dark hair and a white physician's coat. She explained what was happening to David, and that she was afraid it was serious. ""And he said, 'You know, I just got done with my neurological residency up at Lenox Hill Hospital. I'll take him in the back and look,'"" she said. ""Within two or three minutes, he came out and he said, 'You are absolutely right. Something is very seriously wrong.'"" He told them to go to Lenox Hill Hospital, and that he had called the doctor with whom he had done his residency. ""He'll be waiting for you,"" Lubarsky recalled him saying. But Lubarsky began to cry, realizing she had no way of getting there, because she didn't have any more cash for a cab. This was the early 1980s, when cab drivers didn't accept credit cards. ""Without any hesitation, this young doc took a $20 bill out of his wallet, walked us out to the curb, shoved us into a cab, and said, 'Get up to Lenox Hill Hospital and they'll take care of you,'"" Lubarsky said. When they arrived, the doctor found that David had a serious condition called arteriovenous malformation — an abnormal tangle of blood vessels that can cause uncontrolled bleeding in the brain. He later had a 10-hour surgery, and eventually made a full recovery. David and Sarah Lubarsky in Sept. 2023. David Lubarsky hide caption David and Sarah Lubarsky in Sept. 2023. Lubarsky says that without the doctor's intervention, she and her fiancé would have likely gone back to their apartment, where she can't imagine what could have happened. If Lubarsky could see her unsung hero today, she said she would probably start to cry. ""Then I would give him a big hug, and then I would repay him the $20 he so graciously gave me 40 years ago,"" she said. My Unsung Hero is also a podcast — new episodes are released every Tuesday.

Washington Post,‘Slow Horses’ goes fast and hard in its third season,2023-11-29 05:00:00,Lili Loofbourow,"The best spy thrillers are drab and a little hopeless.Those who agree with me — and there are dozens of us — have probably already discovered “Slow Horses,” the Apple TV Plus drama about Slough House, the dilapidated office to which disgraced MI5 agents are sent to be verbally abused and routinely demoralized by the pungent, alcoholic misanthrope in charge. Gary Oldman plays Jackson Lamb, the brilliant grouch in question. And his talents have never, not even when he played George Smiley in “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,” been put to better use.The series’s third season begins Wednesday with an uncharacteristically action-packed sequence set in Istanbul that involves none of the principals but culminates in the death of an agent. The story picks up a year or so later, with the Slough House staff still moldering. The prospects of River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) have not improved after the mistakes he made in the second season, so he childishly revolts when Catherine Standish (the extraordinary Saskia Reeves) asks him to itemize some “Ringo-level” files no one will ever read before transferring them to a new facility. Louisa Guy (Rosalind Eleazar) is still mourning the death of her partner, Min, while Roddy Ho, the office hacker (Christopher Chung) comes up with elaborate schemes to get her to sleep with him. Newer team members Shirley Dander (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) and Marcus Longridge (Kadiff Kirwan) bond, a little unwillingly, as outsiders struggling with various addictions. And Lamb bullies his worried doctor into lying about how much he really drinks. He’s resigned to the consequences and is disinclined to change course.When one of the “horses” gets kidnapped, the others … react.The third season ratchets up the contrast between Slough House and its glitzy counterpart, the Park, where the agents are in good standing, the lights are bright and the staff is stylish, safe and well-funded. It is, however, contested domain, with Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) and her archrival and superior, MI5 Director Dame Ingrid Tearney (Sophie Okonedo), wrestling for control, and for the support of sleazy Home Secretary Peter Judd (Samuel West).It’s not exactly an upstairs/downstairs dynamic, but there is a vaguely classed split between those who care (and are disenfranchised) and those who don’t (and accrue power). The third season confirms, in ways sophomore seasons never quite can, what the show is really is about. “Slow Horses” is ultimately less invested in fake-outs (of which there are many) than it is in the fascinatingly artless conversations that expose them. By this I mean that even bitter antagonists on this show tend to operate with striking candor. People lie, certainly, but everyone is a little too jaded to keep up the pretense once the other has guessed the truth.That extra layer of cynicism matters. It adds a deliciously fatalistic dimension to a format vulnerable to the fantasy that powers a lot of forgettable “secret agent” entertainment, namely that outcomes can be changed by a combination of quick thinking and violence. That element isn’t entirely absent from “Slow Horses,” of course. The last two episodes of this new season rely on this fetishization of contingency more than they satirize it, in fact — to their detriment. (There is more action in this season of “Slow Horses” than in all the others combined.)But “Slow Horses” is strongest when it’s thinking in chess metaphors. You can come up with a surprise or two, certainly, but you’re highly constrained by all that’s gone before. Your moves will be mostly predictable, and so will your team’s, because everyone knows roughly how knights and rooks move. The rules of engagement are set, and if you’re any good at the game, you’ll see exactly how it’s all going to shake out long before it does.Militating against this largely deterministic backdrop is the adrenaline for which thrillers are famous. Some of that split-second decision-making this season comes from Dander, but most of it comes from Cartwright, the character who (if this were a less original show) would be the maverick. The cool guy. The sexy, rule-breaking protagonist. He’d be confident, and he’d be right.In “Slow Horses,” Cartwright is wrong. A lot. For the consumer of thrills, this turns out to be oddly thrilling! We’re not used to the hero messing up badly, and it’s mildly destabilizing that so many of these agents, even the “good” ones, fail as much, and as spectacularly, as they do. That’s no more a condemnation of their merit than their placement at Slough House was: Cartwright is obviously talented. Many of his instincts are sound. He’s good-looking, resourceful and brave. Not to mention MI5 royalty: His grandfather (played by Jonathan Pryce) is a retired officer. But he’s also incredibly easy to bait, partly because he’s so eager to prove himself, so sure he should be the protagonist.And indeed, in the first season, he sort of was. “Slow Horses” has since course-corrected, pulling focus from the guy with the leading-man looks. It was the right call. He would have been a bland hero. His adrenaline and idealism, on the other hand — as foils to Lamb’s pessimism and lethargy — make it possible for the show to run parallel plots at bizarrely different paces.This two-speed trick is part of what makes “Slow Horses” feel new, even though it’s an obvious remix of familiar genres: Cartwright, whose impulsivity keeps landing him in hot water, is almost always running, whereas Lamb, who’s usually several steps ahead of him, barely moves. It’s a very funny setup, even if plot mechanics sometimes sag under the strain. (There are moments this season when Cartwright is seconds away from certain death while a leisurely Lamb storyline develops — with apparent simultaneity — over several minutes.)The contrast between the two does deeper work, too, of course. Cartwright’s idealism goes a long way toward leavening a dour tone that could — without the former’s commitment and loyalty — pull the viewer asunder with lectures on meaningless work and failed systems. Underpinning “Slow Horses” is a convincing and deeply pessimistic consensus view of what intelligence services (and people, and countries) do. There’s a sense that it’s all been done before, it will all be done again, terrible things will happen, and very little can be done to stop them. Lamb’s “interrogations” don’t feel much like interrogations, because the moves are all so rote by now. (At one point last season, he complained that his hand was tired from holding a gun — so he and his interlocutor agreed to take the gun-pointing as read.)This is bleak gamesmanship indeed, rivaling “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.” (Mick Herron, who wrote the darkly comic books on which “Slow Horses” is based, adores John le Carré.) But Cartwright’s good intentions and Lamb’s strategic malodorousness (and humor) put a new twist on that potent old formula.That brings me to my one serious criticism: Although the third season develops some long-simmering storylines beautifully, treating a couple of slow, important arcs with the care they deserve, six episodes aren’t sufficient to bridge the massive consequences of this particular plot. The show’s pleasure in twists sometimes feels as if it fails to really reckon with the bigger picture in ways that make Lamb’s conduct, in particular, feel tonally imprecise.It’s still a fun, drab, smelly, unexpected watch.",7436,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2023/11/29/slow-horses-season-three-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story hero point partner jade episode rival pretense resourceful pessimistic possible pungent asks fantasy diana important fails viewer element john predictable turn wrestling fun tone minute expose genre knight develops change ultimately glitzy dilapidate kadiff routinely christopher familiar violence famous sophie mechanic george surprise focus ratchet partly wrong grouch officer foil discover terrible agent stylish long hand big demoralize samuel metaphor call move light adrenaline easy edward quick indeed entirely facility candor probably carré kirwan split cynicism sexy artless happen newer apparent lowden question mistake park badly wednesday vaguely write spectacularly bland royalty secretary confident mildly confirms extra shake tonally alcoholic played talented oldman lamb stop complain bridge rely away disincline west impulsivity archrival molder book addiction character louisa begin sophomore strong sort thriller bully season chung bizarrely base house operate gamesmanship smelly sound director kristin conduct watch largely backdrop rote abuse charge soldier ingrid antagonist former rosalind storyline fail mick culminates plot combination dander obvious simultaneity massive different istanbul pleasure asunder trick drama gary play tinker thrill potent barely control combine mess horse fascinatingly revolt particular detriment strategic consensus standish prove reef deserve drab staff support domain brave hacker run sleazy condemnation outcome strike improve kidnap taverner retire twist contrast moment resign setup marcus pessimism make leaven worried year merit matter unexpected feel guess part okonedo interrogation funny tend water power saskia cool picture format pryce protagonist team pull bond intention gun lethargy mention loyalty home bitter bait system scheme game course cartwright consumer deterministic brilliant vulnerable counterpart intelligence smiley read disgrace invest drink fatalistic secret herron tailor scott accrue highly service tearney river dame involves dozen land extraordinary commitment underpin slow dour jackson set contingency humor eager verbally safe office action view strain bleak rule grandfather doctor hot couple fetishization class entertainment engagement thomas idealism guy meaningless ahead jonathan reckon country childishly sag parallel adores series comic struggle spy original work tv step convincing add oddly superior mourn incredibly consequence roddy lecture brings conversation layer dynamic judd catherine hold roughly remix file darkly forgettable agree put death rook elaborate misanthrope disenfranchise deliciously constrain itemize satirize eleazar chess criticism slough tire deeply maverick dimension show member sufficient placement pick unwillingly lot leisurely treat principal apple sequence absent destabilize arc uncharacteristically shirley outsider lie bright contest prospect malodorousness talent jack fact instinct beautifully sleep deeper stand interlocutor transfer longridge,0.98955,0.2824098977945131,7.682030728122907,0.5198187683619339,0,2023-11-29
NPR,"With just a photo and a name, she spent decades looking for her biological dad",2023-11-29 05:00:00,Nellie Gilles,"When Annette Vega was in elementary school, she learned that her dad was not her biological father. She didn't think much of it at the time — she had a happy childhood and loving parents. But as she grew older and became a mom at the age of 18, she began to think about the father with whom she shared DNA. So she set out to find him, with little more than a name: Angel Alberto Garcia. Angel Garcia, date and location unknown. Annette Vega hide caption Vega's mother, Jeanne Ortiz, was 16 when she met Garcia in 1969. He worked at the local auto body shop and was a handsome, confident young man with green eyes. Everyone called him ""Machu."" ""He was a bad boy,"" Oritz recalls. ""He used to steal cars, and I think he used to steal cars just for the fun of it."" The two teenagers spent time together taking car rides through the Bronx. ""He was sweet. He was good to me,"" Ortiz recalls. ""He talked about the future, when we got married. He was a charmer, let me tell you."" Vega as a child with her mother Jeanne Ortiz. Jeanne Ortiz hide caption Ortiz became pregnant and gave birth to Vega in April 1970. But her relationship with Garcia didn't last. She told Vega about one of their last conversations: ""I was insulting him. I told him that he was not your father, that he was only a father because he made you, but not because he raised you or supported you. I knew that that would hit him hard."" Garcia disappeared after that and Ortiz didn't know what happened to him. Vega began searching for her father online using only his name and his mother's name. With so little information, she hit a lot of dead ends. Then she heard a rumor that Garcia might be a member of the Ching-a-Lings, a predominantly Puerto Rican motorcycle club that identified as outlaws — with a reputation for violent behavior and drug dealing. She decided to follow the lead. Vega found the Ching-a-Lings' headquarters in the Bronx — a building painted black, with a line of motorcycles out front and people hanging out on the stoop. She approached apprehensively, explaining that she was trying to find her father. Members of the Ching-a-Lings motorcycle gang go into the group's clubhouse in the South Bronx in 1975. Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images hide caption She told the Ching-a-Lings everything she knew: that his name was Angel Garcia, he had green eyes and everyone called him ""Machu."" A woman smoking a cigarette recognized the description — he had taken care of her after a night of hard partying. She described him as a ""nice guy,"" but hadn't seen him in years. Another dead end. ""I felt kind of silly, looking for so long without a real reason as to why I was looking for him,"" Vega, now 53, told Radio Diaries. ""I didn't need him to be my father. I still really wanted to find him."" She also wanted to find and reconnect with his side of the family. After doing a DNA test, Vega finally matched with a distant cousin on Ancestry.com who told her that Garcia had a sister who was a teacher. The sister's name was Miriam Garcia and she lived in Florida. Coincidentally, just 20 minutes from where Vega was living. Vega was excited, but nervous. What would her aunt think about a stranger showing up, claiming to be her niece? She crafted a lengthy, carefully-worded message to Miriam's son on Facebook, explaining who she was and how she found them. ""That evening, my phone rings. I hear this woman crying, emotional. She says, 'Annette, mi sobrina, mi sobrina. Tanto tiempo que te estaba buscando.' All this time, my niece, I've been looking for you!"" Vega had found her father's family. Angel Garcia (right) with his sister Miriam (second from right) and their mother and brother. Annette Vega hide caption Angel Garcia (right) with his sister Miriam (second from right) and their mother and brother. She visited Miriam at her home in Florida in April 2023. They sat down together and Miriam began sharing stories about Garcia's past. Growing up, the family lived in Puerto Rico and they had a difficult childhood. Their father was an alcoholic, so as a teenager, Garcia left home and started living on the streets. Vega and Miriam in April 2023. Nellie Gilles/Radio Diaries hide caption Miriam says he was later arrested on a drug charge and sent to a minimum security prison called Campamento Guavate De Cayey. Miriam would visit him and bring food, and in return, he'd make gifts for his family. It was around this time, in the mid 1980s — when Vega would have been a teenager — that Garcia told Miriam he was HIV positive. Miriam recalled the day police officers came to the house, looking for her brother. The officers informed the family that he had escaped from Camp Guavate and was on the run. Miriam remembered receiving a call from Garcia in 1989. He was calling from a payphone in New York City and was very sick with pneumonia. That was the last time she heard from him. Learning this 30 years later, Vega suspected he was dead. She knew the AIDS epidemic had hit New York City very hard in the 1980s, and if he'd fallen ill with pneumonia it was unlikely he would have survived. But she wanted proof. She found an online database run by a nonprofit called The Hart Island Project, containing records of people buried in America's largest public cemetery, off the coast of the Bronx. Hart Island. Andrew Lichtenstein/Radio Diaries hide caption There were several Angel Garcias in the database. One entry was for a man who died at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens on August 3, 1989, at the age of 37. The dates matched up. Vega requested and received a death certificate and an autopsy. The report said that the immediate cause of death was pneumonia, due to AIDS, as a consequence of chronic intravenous narcotism. Vega went to her aunt Miriam's house and showed her the documents. She remembered her aunt turning to her and saying, ""This is him. You found your father."" On a foggy Sunday morning this past Spring, Vega and her daughter drove to a pier in the Bronx to catch the ferry to Hart Island, a small strip of land where more than a million people are buried. Waiting by the dock was her half brother whom she had never met: 43-year-old Angel Garcia, named after their father. The two siblings were nervous, but they embraced each other. Vega and her half brother, Angel Garcia, meeting for the first time. Andrew Lichtenstein/Radio Diaries hide caption The ferry brought them across the sound, where they boarded a small bus which drove around the island making stops at different graves. A park ranger escorted Vega and her brother to a white post with the number 201 painted in black. This was where Angel Alberto Garcia was buried, in a pine coffin along with about 150 other people in a mass grave. There were no individual headstones or plaques. Vega brushed her fingers across the white marker and bent down to plant some flowers. She began sharing stories from her more than 30-year search, and in return, her brother shared the few memories he had of their father. When she first learned about Hart Island, Vega was disturbed that this was where her father was buried. Her brother was too and wanted to disinter him, to give him a ""proper burial."" But their views both seemed to soften as they stood by the grave. Vega and her half brother, Angel Garcia, visiting the grave of their father for the first time.

""To tell him like, 'Yo, Annette found you, she found us, and we're here — and now we know where you are.'""

Washington Post,The gentle power of Rosalynn Carter,2023-11-29 05:00:00,Monica Hesse,"Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter were married before many of us were born, before many of our parents were born, before many of our grandparents were born. In 1946, Rosalynn, who had been her high school’s valedictorian, was a student at a junior college with plans to transfer to a four-year institution. Jimmy was the brother of a friend, and he proposed when she was only 18, and university never happened for Rosalynn but the rest of life did.At her funeral on Tuesday afternoon, her grandson Jason talked about how Rosalynn was born only a few years after the 20th Amendment gave women the right to vote, in a blip of a small town where people still plowed their fields behind mules. “But she was made for these long journeys,” he said. “She was made to summit these mountains.”She had visited more than 100 countries, the assembled mourners were told. She learned to ski in her 60s, she kept skiing until her 80s. Her latter years were filled with humanitarian work with Habitat for Humanity. While in the White House, she defined the role of the modern, issue-driven first lady, pioneering open conversations about mental health in an era when such matters were addressed in whispers. She famously asked to sit in on Cabinet meetings because, as journalist Judy Woodruff said in her eulogy, Rosalynn wanted to make sure she could offer her husband intelligent counsel about the state matters that occupied his day. “Without Rosalynn Carter, I don’t believe there would have been a President Carter,” Woodruff said.And that's always been the role of presidential wives, hasn't it? To be the lady behind the president, the woman who makes the man.In the front row of the funeral sat all five of the living first ladies, Melania Trump improbably positioned next to Michelle Obama. Jason Carter took a moment to recognize the meaning of their attendance. “Thank you all for coming and acknowledging this remarkable sisterhood that you share with my grandmother. And thank you for leadership that you provided this country and the world.” He paused. “Secretary Clinton and Dr. Biden, we also welcome your lovely husbands.”At that last line, the entire church erupted in applause, slowly at first and then raucously as the mourners caught onto the joke: Secretary Clinton and Dr. Biden are, of course, Hillary and Jill — women of tremendous accomplishments in their own rights who nevertheless spent much of their adult lives as a wife-of — the kinds of women who are so often thanked for their support rather than the ones being supported, the kinds of women who hosted instead governed, the kinds of women who might have, in 1946, left their educations behind to marry the kinds of men about whom people might one day say, Without her there wouldn’t have been him.“Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” Jimmy said after her death last week, according to the Carter Center. Which is lovely, and also not strictly true. Maybe he couldn’t have done it without her, and maybe in another life she could have done it with his support. But in this life he was the one who was president.Throughout the funeral I found myself thinking about the women of Rosalynn Carter’s generation who had made the (not-uncommon) choice she made to marry very young. I thought about the sacrifices that were not thought of as sacrifices for women in those days. I thought about the dignity they brought to those lives of unacknowledged sacrifice.I found myself thinking of my own maternal grandmother, a Midwesterner from a small town who married my grandfather in 1947, one year after Rosalynn and Jimmy had wed. She’d studied to be a musician; instead she became the wife of the town’s only pediatrician, a man who was able to do his job only because she was there by his side. She made his future her own, and soon it was their future. And she played cello sometimes in the local civic orchestra.Rosalynn Carter’s husband became governor and they were married. He became president and they were married, and they were married still for 43 years after his term ended — the back half of their union longer than many entire relationships. Can you imagine? They summited so many mountains. Her journey was so long.After the funeral ended, after talking heads on television had stopped broadcasting the livestream and started talking instead about Gaza and Nikki Haley and the economy — after all of that, the image that stuck with me was of Jimmy Carter in the church.

Washington Post,Damaged sheet music was discovered at Auschwitz. A composer got to work.,2023-11-29 05:00:00,María Luisa Paúl,"With the wave of a conductor’s baton, a heartbreaking melody began to resound inside a concert hall in London — a song composed by a prisoner in a Nazi death camp that, until Monday, had not been played in public.“Futile Regrets,” as the composition was titled, unfolded like the pages of a tragic novel. The violin strings reverberated with the weight of unspeakable sorrows. With each note, the instruments conjured the cold, unforgiving realities of the barbed wire and watchtowers that once imprisoned its anonymous composer at Auschwitz-Birkenau.The song was part of a collection of 210 pieces of music that British composer and conductor Leo Geyer stumbled upon in 2015 while visiting the World War II death camp run by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. Geyer made the trip after he was commissioned to create a piece honoring Martin Gilbert, a historian and Holocaust expert who died that February.Geyer traveled to Poland to get a “sense of the gravity” of Gilbert’s work, he said. At the relic of the largest Nazi death camp, barbed-wire fences stretched far into the horizon and out of Geyer’s sight. Within it, nature appeared silent, “almost in mourning” of the approximately 1.1 million people who lost their lives there, he said. But amid that agonizing site, Geyer would soon discover a bounty of musical archives that would inspire his next project.“I had a conversation with one of the archivists, and he said in a somewhat offhand way that there were some [musical] manuscripts in the archive,” Geyer told The Washington Post. “I nearly fell over at the time when he mentioned it because I couldn’t believe that such a thing could exist and that it had been overlooked all this time.”About 80 years ago, musicians at Auschwitz who were part of the camp’s orchestras had arranged and played those scores. Music is deeply intertwined with horrors of the Holocaust, and Nazis used the arts “as part of the murder machine,” Norman Lebrecht, a British music journalist, told the German media outlet DW. Prisoners at Auschwitz and other camps were made to march to forced-labor sites or gas chambers to the beat of the orchestras’ music. The sound would drown out the noise of executions, according to ORT, the global Jewish education network. Nazi officers also assembled prisoner orchestras for their own entertainment.Although music was used for exploitation, it also served as a way for prisoners to express the pain and terror they faced.“Jews being held in concentration camps were unable to document what was happening to them by conventional means. Writing down or photographing this would have been impossible, so they turned to a long cultural tradition of telling their stories through songs and music,” historian Shirli Gilbert said in a news release. “ … Away from the eye of the SS officers, Jews secretly created their own music as a means to cope, survive and document.”After World War II, the orchestras’ scores became a testament to the horrors of the Holocaust. And decades later, as Geyer inspected them at the Auschwitz archives, they inspired the composer to re-create the music that had gone unplayed since then — a feat that would take Geyer seven years, six visits to Auschwitz, several interviews with survivors, and hours upon hours of research.“It’s the equivalent of several hundred jigsaw puzzles, except many of the pieces are missing,” he said. “It requires a certain amount of musical detective work to put the pieces together, to recompose missing parts, to discover the music.”There were fragments of different songs, each with “varying levels of completion,” Geyer said. Some were unfinished. Much of the sheet music had burn marks along the edges. Most scores were incomplete.Further complicating matters was the fact that the orchestras often used a “hodgepodge of random instruments that were available,” Geyer said, including some that are not traditionally used in orchestras like accordions, saxophones and mandolins.“Therefore, a lot of this music would have sounded very strange,” he said. “It’s a lot of pieces that we know and love — for example, Mozart and Beethoven — and then, of course, imagining that with all these strange brass instruments and accordions.”Despite the challenges, Geyer was moved as he encountered powerful messages of resilience hidden on the crumbling pieces of paper. Most of the songs were eerily lively German marching tunes, he said — but the prisoners also managed to weave in the Polish national anthem and music by the American composer John Philip Sousa, such as “The Stars and Stripes Forever.”Yet, the piece that most inspired Geyer to embark on his project was “Futile Regrets,” an example of the secret music the prisoners would craft for themselves. The unfinished composition was a symphony of sorrow that told stories of lives interrupted and futures stolen, he said. The sheet music was unsigned, so the composer’s identity and fate remains a mystery, though Geyer said their handwriting reminded him of his own.“After seeing that, I just felt it was my duty to finish it,” Geyer said. “I’m not Jewish, Romani, Polish, Russian or disabled, or descended from any person from Auschwitz, but I do stand by those who are persecuted for no reason other than who they are. And I hope to live in a world where no evil could rise again.”On Monday, “Futile Regrets” and three other pieces found at Auschwitz were performed as part of a concert celebrating the 10th anniversary of Constella Music, Geyer’s music company. The performance, Geyer said, was organized to raise funds for an upcoming opera ballet that will tell the story of Auschwitz’s prisoner orchestras.",5656,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/11/29/sheet-music-holocaust-auschwitz-composer/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story news run express company fence organize fate barbed post poland complicate offhand project photograph finish nature archivist survivor american inside instrument gravity make rise conventional burn year silent level regret accordion matter commission sousa medium weave john orchestra part turn melody paper eye include feat murder persecute site approximately million hodgepodge expert perform shirli serve amid beat martin hour reason musician russian time testament composer anonymous honor edge mention steal unfolded brass london holocaust unspeakable unplayed tragic handwrite violin interview officer course craft unable cultural discover impossible imagine secretly long accord message agonize concert celebrate horizon move archive release unfinished music love leo arrange secret lose score available conjure compose machine encounter duty identity ballet norman trip manuscript gas pain monday document fell cold happen found ort watchtower write note collection drown jewish challenge outlet chamber hidden constella symphony conductor unforgiving exploitation execution network played nazi romani future believe away performance anthem remains interrupt require strange inspect large piece equivalent assemble gilbert begin weight detective stretch global person recompose raise washington string national work life heartbreaking philip polish art sound futile jew mourn concentration powerful wave ago british stripe travel told auschwitz mark conversation eerily felt survive historian completion unsigned jigsaw mystery despite mozart song intertwine put death live reverberate random traditionally remind composition german tradition prisoner miss beethoven exist occupy page wire disabled fragment world visit noise lively opera amount deeply overlook crumble journalist bounty reality descend cope dw musical different geyer sight embark saxophone evil germany baton inspire decade upcoming lot anniversary stumble camp relic held resilience resound star hope sorrow fact title sheet horror march create hundred hall imprison manage stand vary lebrecht education puzzle terror fund,-0.9928,0.1591230551626591,8.813078324225867,0.3644224664224663,0,2023-11-29
USA TODAY,Tina Knowles defends Beyoncé against 'racist statements' about 'Renaissance' premiere look,2023-11-29 03:35:10,Edward Segarra,"Tina Knowles is coming to her daughter Beyoncé's defense after the ""Renaissance"" artist received criticism over a recent photo on social media. Knowles fired off a lengthy Instagram post on Tuesday to respond to ""racist statements"" about Beyoncé’s Versace look, which she wore for a pair of portraits shared by designer Donatella Versace to coincide with the release of ""Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,"" which premiered in Los Angeles on Saturday. Beyoncé seemingly skipped the film's red carpet, which featured famous guests donning mostly black and silver looks in tribute to the chrome aesthetic of Beyoncé’s ""Renaissance"" album and tour. For her portraits, the ""Break My Soul"" singer wore a sleek silver gown with matching silver gloves and her hair long, straight and platinum blonde. ""She does a film, called the renaissance, where the whole theme is silver with silver hair, a silver carpet, and suggested silver attire and you bozos decide that she's trying to be a white woman and is bleaching her skin?"" Knowles wrote. ""How sad is it that some of her own people continue the stupid narrative with hate and jealousy."" Knowles' post included a video that started off with an image of Beyoncé's silver Versace look, interspersed with comments that read ""she’s not a Black woman!"" and ""why she look so white?"" The image was followed by a montage of archive clips of Beyoncé, set to the tune of her 2019 song ""Brown Skin Girl."" ""Black women have worn platinum hair since the Etta James days,"" Knowles wrote. ""I just went and looked at all the beautiful talented black celebrities who have worn platinum hair and it has been just about everyone of them at one time or another. Are they all trying to be white? I am sick and tired of people attacking her."" Knowles concluded: ""I am sick of you losers … This girl minds her own business. She helps people whenever she can. She lifts up & promotes black women and underdogs at all times."" Prepare for 'Renaissance' tour film: What to wear, how to do mute challenge A number of stars took to the comments section to praise Knowles for her defense of Beyoncé, including Destiny’s Child member LaTavia Roberson. ""Educate Them. they always try to break The Black Woman especially one they feel intimidated by,"" Roberson wrote. ""The true definition of a protector 👏👏👏👏👏"" ""I love you so much Ms. Tina!"" Keke Palmer commented. ""She deserves to be protected in this way!"" 'I’m an incomparable talent': Keke Palmer addresses tweet on colorism, comparing her to Zendaya ""You have raised beautiful, strong, intelligent black, PROUD TO BE BLACK women,"" Octavia Spencer wrote. ""Anyone who says otherwise has their own issues to deal with. I’m sorry you’ve come across the negative comments that people don’t realize is a reflection of how they feel about themselves.""

NPR,U.S. life expectancy starts to recover after sharp pandemic decline,2023-11-29 00:01:00,Pien Huang,"That represents an increase of 1.1 years over 2021 numbers. ""The good news is that life expectancy increased for the first time in two years,"" says Elizabeth Arias, a demographer in the CDC's Division of Vital Statistics and co-author on the paper. ""The not-so-good news is that the increase in life expectancy only accounted for less than 50% of the loss that was experienced between 2019 and 2021."" In 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 became the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer. Average U.S. life expectancy dropped by 2.4 years. Now, even though the trend has reversed, the nation's life expectancy is at the level it was in 2003, noted Arias. Basically, it's like twenty years of lost progress. ""To me, these numbers are rather bleak,"" says Jacob Bor, associate professor of global health and epidemiology at Boston University School of Public Health, ""The extent to which life expectancy has recovered is far short of what people had hoped."" Most of the gains in 2022 U.S. life expectancy come from fewer COVID deaths – COVID dropped to the fourth leading cause of death. There were also some declines in mortality due to heart disease, injuries, cancers and homicide. Some of those declines were offset by increases in mortality due to flu and pneumonia, birth problems, kidney disease and malnutrition. Researchers say U.S. life expectancy lags far behind other wealthy countries. ""We started falling, relative to other countries, in the 1980's and we have just fallen further and further behind,"" says Eileen Crimmins, chair of gerontology at the University of Southern California. Crimmins says other wealthy countries in Europe and Asia do much better on preventing early deaths from causes such as heart disease, gun violence, giving birth and infectious diseases for which there are vaccines. ""These are things that don't require scientific investigation to know how to actually prevent them,"" she says. ""Other countries prevent them. We don't."" There are also huge differences in life expectancy by race and ethnicity tucked into the U.S. life expectancy numbers. ""The disparities are tremendous,"" says Arias from CDC. American Indian/Alaskan Native and Black populations consistently have far lower life expectancies than the White population. These gaps were exacerbated during the pandemic, and remain quite large. Researchers hope the 2022 numbers serve as a wake-up call to policymakers to take measures to improve quality of life — and reduce early, preventable deaths — in the U.S.",2521,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/11/29/1215746931/us-life-expectancy-2022-increase,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,policymakers news bleak vaccine population expectancy improve asia nation twenty gerontology wealthy extent pandemic loss race health scientific american vital homicide country exacerbate mortality year difference infectious recover disparity level school demographer require large researcher represent global paper early aria reduce kidney life experienced lag basically boston investigation bor europe offset ethnicity serve violence huge remain time california gun cdc due give death hop trend preventable division elizabeth injury start fourth pneumonia native jacob call public low lead birth decline reverse account black professor associate cancer average lose flu tremendous quality problem malnutrition southern progress short disease white tucked prevent crimmins chair gap drop hope eileen heart measure covid increase epidemiology consistently statistic note fall number university relative,-0.58245,0.1190003966679889,9.180756302521008,0.4634551495016611,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,Ask Amy: Moving to be closer to our grandchild didn’t work out,2023-11-29 00:00:00,Amy Dickinson,"Dear Amy: My husband and I retired to a wonderful Southwestern city. Our two adult children are married and live in other parts of the country. They each have young children.During the pandemic, my son, daughter-in-law and baby granddaughter in Florida were alone, with no nearby relatives — as were we. After the pandemic, we decided that we should move to Florida to help them out, and in turn, they would be there for us as we aged.They were also excited and encouraged us to purchase a home near them. We bought a home (over FaceTime!), sold our other home, quit our local clubs and activities, and moved.We quickly realized that we had made a mistake and that we didn’t like living in Florida. We assumed we would become an integral part of our kids’ lives, but their expectations were totally different. We only babysat twice in six months! After six months, we moved back to the Southwest.We are now working to resume our old lives, but my daughter-in-law no longer calls us or participates in calls to any extent. I know we made a hasty decision that has resulted in hurt and bad feelings. I also know that our expectations were unrealistic. However, I would love to resume a relationship with my daughter-in-law.Our son is very cordial and generally eager to put our granddaughter on FaceTime with us. I’m reluctant to phone my daughter-in-law directly. I don’t want to make matters worse. We must not be the only people afflicted with “pandemic panic” who made hasty decisions!Your thoughts?— RegretfulRegretful: People make mistakes. People make blunders. Yours seems to have been a bit of a doozy, but you obviously have the means to undo this choice. Your about-face also seems to have occurred at warp speed; it was a quick “whoopsie … we out!”Surely you can imagine how bewildered your son and his wife might be about your recent behavior. Write your daughter-in-law a letter or email. Own your embarrassment and apologize for the effects of your choice on them.Say: “We are at a point in our own lives where we are trying our hardest to do what is best for us. I think the experience during the pandemic made us panic, and we were too hasty in our decision to move to Florida.“We’re resettled and happy, but I’m embarrassed and upset by the effects our choice has had on you. I know we made a hasty decision that has resulted in hurt feelings. We love you and really want to make this right, so I hope you can forgive us. I really miss our contact with you. I hope you will communicate with us when you feel ready. You can express your feelings or frustration, and we will listen.”Dear Amy: My son, 15, has been playing baseball at a high level since he was quite young. There is no doubt that he is talented.A couple of years ago, his coach told us that he believes our son has major potential. My wife seized on this and seems to believe that he could play pro one day. I am more skeptical.Our son sustained a tough injury last spring, tearing a tendon. The surgery was painful, and his recovery has been slow. Given what this has been like for all of us, I would like him to reassess his participation. My wife and his coach believe he should continue.This has become a tension point in our family, so I’m looking for your objective opinion.— Concerned DadDad: Overall, I think it’s wise to reassess everything — always! Maturing involves consciously reviewing one’s choices. So, yes, I’m all for reassessment. But your son is 15. He is old enough to decide whether he wants to continue and to accept whatever consequences flow from his choice.As parents, you and your wife should always leave the door open for him to decide — for himself — what he wants to do. That includes continuing with his sport, stopping or continuing now and stopping later.Dear Amy: “Dog Tired” described a scenario that sounds like a “Judge Judy” case in the making.The most frequent cases heard on that show seem to involve dog attacks and bridezillas. Dog Tired should wash their hands of this situation and let the bride deal with the consequences from injuries/damages caused by ill-behaved dogs.— ReaderReader: I agree!

Washington Post,Carolyn Hax: Feeling betrayed as a beloved employee jumps to the competition,2023-11-29 00:00:00,Carolyn Hax,"Dear Carolyn: My husband is a dream boss. He treats his employees like a family. He pays them well, gives them generous bonuses, paid vacations, etc. — way beyond what a regular employer would do. His staff is loyal, and they know he plans to retire in two years. They all are part of a profit share that he set up when the business sells.His favorite employee is “Jill.” She’s terrific. My husband saw potential in her when he hired her. He paid her college tuition, so she could learn the business. He bought her a car, helped her with a down payment on a house, helped pay for her wedding and vacations, and encouraged her to get more education, which he paid for. Through my husband’s connections, he helped Jill and her husband adopt a child. Jill has thrived. Every now and then, she would write him a thank-you letter referring to him as the father she never had. He has told me over the years that he loves her like a daughter.Yesterday, my husband came home so distressed. Jill told him that she is leaving. She was hired away by a competitor. My husband matched the offer and asked her to stay through his retirement. Jill refused, saying she is tired of the job and the commute. She was abrupt and callous.Jill has broken my husband’s heart. I am so angry at the ingratitude. My husband cannot retire until he trains another replacement, and Jill knows this. He feels betrayed. What can I do to help him and contain my own sense of betrayal?— Distraught WifeDistraught Wife: Jill was always your husband’s employee, not his daughter, no matter how much he cared. I am sorry to put it so bluntly, but it’s the entire answer, if you let it be. It is not a betrayal to leave for a job that fits better. Even with a competitor. Even when it upsets his plans. Even when he bought her a car.Because I suspect you won’t let that be the entire answer, here’s another one from the family angle:Dad dotes on Daughter and thinks she’s the sun and the moon and the stars. Daughter loves Dad and shines in all the ways Dad knows she can.All along, Daughter has been land- and ocean-curious, but the sky arrangement is so generous, she can’t even think about breaking Dad’s heart and telling him she’s ready for new things.Until she can think about it — because she can think of little else, because the years are adding up and she’s still in the sky, no closer to testing out the land or the ocean.Dad, meanwhile, is about to hand over the reins to the sky not even knowing it’s not what she wants anymore, if she ever really did want it — it’s so hard to separate a doting parent’s vision from one’s own — because all along, as generous as he’s been, it has always been Dad’s idea of the life he wants for her, with each “gift” an investment toward that return.So she has to make the break. It’s clearly too-late-ish to be a good time to leave, but it’s only getting later.Plus, when guilt, power imbalances and implied debts are involved, things can get “abrupt and callous” fast.Does that version help? Just because something hurts doesn’t make it a betrayal. Jill, for her reasons, had to leave the professional nest. “Kids” do that.",3135,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/11/29/carolyn-hax-beloved-employee-quits/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,carolyn dotes ready version leave bonus upset retire husband shine separate sorry moon hire tuition bluntly payment contain make connection gift away year parent matter dream feel hard ingratitude rein guilt suspect angle callous generous part bos terrific offer potential refuse life power employee entire job add house retirement told debt employer kid competitor reason closer time imbalance adopt dot give business put anymore child letter home commute sky betrayal regular dear plan jill train refer paid hand test involve family tire investment stay arrangement daughter vacation share answer love betrayed match car hurt vision sun replacement distraught wedding abrupt angry bought dad imply treat land encourage star favorite profit set broken wife fit idea loyal heart college wifedistraught learn thrive pay distressed professional staff write nest education father break,0.94585,0.1913875598086124,4.433868194842408,0.6202803468932502,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,Miss Manners: How do I respond to insults about being a lawyer?,2023-11-29 00:00:00,Judith Martin,"Dear Miss Manners: How does one politely, yet firmly, respond to people who insult one’s profession?I am a lawyer, and I say so when I’m asked what my profession is. Some people feel it is then their right, or even their obligation, to go on a tirade against all lawyers. This happens mostly at social gatherings where I would prefer not to respond in kind, yet I feel as if some response is warranted.Any suggestions for how to respond in a manner that is within the bounds of good manners, yet isn’t just smiling through my teeth?“I hope you’ll never need one.”Dear Miss Manners: This morning, I read the obituaries of three local women.The first spent just two sentences describing the deceased, followed by a list of 26 people who had predeceased her and 37 people who had survived her, with no description of how they were related to the deceased. It was essentially just a long list of names.The second obituary listed the survivors of the deceased as including “a great-grandson expected in August,” which seems to stretch the definition of “survivor.”Finally, the third obituary that caught my attention listed the dead woman’s six “grand-dogs,” by name, before listing her five human grandchildren.Are there no longer any basic rules of etiquette or guidelines for such publications?There is at least one inviolable rule, which is that we do not criticize other people’s choices while they are grieving, even if the choices are poor ones — and even if they enliven our breakfast reading.Dear Miss Manners: I was asked to attend a retirement gathering. While such events are typically held for only one guest of honor, this is for two former co-workers. It will be a small gathering at a local restaurant, and I plan on attending.One of the retirees, Jenna, is a person I would like to talk to. She is so insightful, and my years working with her were always a pleasure. Unfortunately, Jason, the other honoree, is another story. His actions became one of several reasons I left the company. Jason got paid much more than I did, yet somehow I was given some of his duties on top of my own busy workload.The problem is that I want to give Jenna a small gift, but not Jason. I know Jason’s wife will make some kind of comment about my giving only Jenna a gift. I am struggling for a polite reply if this happens.Tell Jenna at the party how much you enjoyed working with her, and that you have a small token of appreciation you would like to mail to her later, if she would provide an address.Miss Manners also insists that you congratulate Jason on his retirement.

MSNBC,Will Yeezys every truly die? Not until we stop giving Ye our money,2023-11-28 23:54:00,Joshua K. Wright,"Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, was one of pop music’s biggest stars in 2013 when he inked his first sneakers deal with Adidas. However, his creative energy and focus shifted toward disrupting the fashion industry. Following an internship at Fendi and a collaboration with Louis Vuitton, Nike briefly hired him to collaborate on two sneaker projects: the Air Yeezy I and II. But it was the star’s partnership with Adidas that would be as lucrative as it was, ultimately, controversial. One of Twohey’s major suggestions is that Adidas allegedly “appeased” its star collaborator’s vile behavior for a decade. But another major question posed by Twohey’s article remains. The Ye-Adidas marriage seemed like a true win-win. Ye became one of only a handful of Black billionaires worldwide. Adidas was able to compete with Nike for brand supremacy. But as Megan Twohey reveals in her recent New York Times exposé, this dysfunctional relationship, which eroded last year in the wake of Ye’s increasingly antisemitic comments, was rooted in deplorable behavior. One of Twohey’s major suggestions is that Adidas allegedly “appeased” its star collaborator’s vile behavior for a decade. But another major question posed by Twohey’s article remains. To what extent was consumer behavior responsible for Adidas’ willingness to overlook Ye’s toxic and self-destructive behavior? And to what extent is it still happening? This Cyber Monday and holiday season, shoppers will spend millions on sneakers. While Ye’s Adidas originals are now harder to find, many pairs remain available via third-party sellers. And as Jewish groups warn about a surge in antisemitic hate tied to the Israel-Hamas war, the question of consumer complicity is as salient as ever. Times reporter Twohey painted a picture of an unprofessional and at times abusive environment where Ye allegedly made antisemitic remarks, berated women, forced workers to watch pornography and demanded excessive perks from executives. Adidas shut the project down in 2022. But commerce arguably outweighed conscience when Adidas started reselling Yeezys in May after a projected annual $700 billion loss. A portion of the sale went to charity, including the Anti-Defamation League, but Ye was entitled to royalties. While declining to comment specifically on the Times reporting, Adidas said in a statement in October that the company “has no tolerance for hate speech and offensive behavior, which is why the company terminated the Adidas Yeezy partnership.” Ye could not be reached for comment. Of course, Adidas is not the only brand to profit from problematic celebrity spokespersons. But signs that Kanye was a dangerous loose cannon existed long before he praised Hitler. This is the guy who sold merchandise with Confederate flag logos during his 2013 Yeezus tour and encouraged white concertgoers to recite the N-word as they sang his lyrics. He boasted that Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam and considered by many to be homophobic and antisemitic, befriended him. During a 2015 interview on The Breakfast Club, he revealed his plans for a forthcoming Farrakhan documentary and his desire to have Farrakhan present him with the BET Honors Visionary Award. Three things drove Yeezy’s popularity: consumer culture, sneaker culture and celebrity culture. According to historian William Leach, author of ""Land of Desire: Merchants, Power, and the Rise of a New American Culture,"" the roots of consumer culture date back to the turn of the 20th century. This culture intensified after the Great Depression and the advent of television marketing. Psychologist Tim Kasser, author of “The Science of Values in the Culture of Consumption,” says many individuals have “extrinsic” values based on status and praise from others. Studies show that in this social media age, many consumers under 35 base their self-worth on “likes” for their pictures and posts. So-called sneakerheads exist at the intersection of street-smart style and influencer culture. Elizabeth Semmelhack, the curator for Toronto’s Bata Shoe Museum, and author of ""Out of the Box: The Rise of Sneaker Culture,"" says sneaker culture emerged in the 1980s with the arrival of Nike’s Air Jordans and Adidas’ first alignment with rappers Run-D.M.C. Teens were killing each other for their Jordans in the '90s. But the rise of social media supercharged the consumer base. The Kardashians, with their combined billions in net worth and loyal followers, “helped target a whole new demographic ... to experience sneaker culture. It was a blending of high and low fashion,” claims sneaker strategist Jazerai Allen-Lord. This combination of sneaker fanatics, online sneaker vloggers hungry for clout, and a billion-dollar resale market helped popularize the Yeezy phenomenon. A pair of Yeezys resold for $1.8 million in 2022. Three things drove Yeezy’s popularity: consumer culture, sneaker culture, and celebrity culture. When I discussed my book “Wake Up, Mr. West: Kanye West and the Double Consciousness of Black Celebrity” at a Washington, D.C. venue two weeks after Adidas dropped Ye, I asked if people should stop wearing Yeezys or listening to his music. By my rough estimation, only about 20% of them said yes. While this was an unscientific sample, it illustrates the tremendous sway celebrity culture continues to have over consumers. Echoing other elements of “cancel culture,” many consumers are more than happy to keep buying products made by or endorsed by problematic celebrities. This in turn sends a very confusing message to the celebrities themselves. If consumers really want to send a message to Adidas and Ye, they must stop buying Yeezys. Our words have power, but our wallets arguably have even more. Think about that the next time you lovingly covet a stranger’s Yeezy Slides and Foam Runners. Joshua K. Wright is an associate professor of history at Trinity Washington University in Washington, D.C., the host of the ""Woke History"" podcast and the author of ""Wake Up, Mr. West"": Kanye West and the Double Consciousness of Black Celebrity.""",6085,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/yeezys-adidas-kanye-west-rcna126868,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0QnXrS2STCJkb2iD0VvN8AHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0QnXrS2STCJkb2iD0VvN8AHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain make happy present reporting stranger honor speech pair consumption kill woke collaborator back runner partnership worker dysfunctional culture league yeezy warn visionary praise picture concertgoers holiday word yeezus comment recent arrival jazerai combination decline hire emerge logo abusive homophobic market dangerous hungry historian appease statement nation wear offensive terminate toronto extent vile advent consider sway formerly shopper joshua clout sell century base reveal leach sends tim covet creative museum behavior social excessive low buying allegedly briefly celebrity vloggers group charity blending marketing value air exist flag star increasingly forthcoming vuitton surge loose article environment befriend berate commerce week land wallet handful merchandise send tremendous pose plan yeezys stop reveals award monday sign outweigh shut antisemitic semmelhack popularize echo podcast science pornography islam major university kardashians jordan kanye wright continue interview disrupt club focus experience fashion discuss entitle host nike october depression industry problematic deal style million recite complicity york sneakerheads executive big shift intersection history encourage company energy confederate collaborate power influencer louis relationship reach consumer drove associate find venue combine trinity toxic overlook twohey great west study target supercharge hate include profit sample ultimately confuse strategist book spokesperson guy lyric kasser exposé reporter resold internship inked television time decade happen lovingly black salient desire status show specifically sneaker lucrative resale white force willingness shoe responsible message annual original remark double wake professor brand accord portion boast harder phenomenon documentary course collaboration remains age rise woman worldwide rapper compete pop billionaire question year fanatic long arguably cancel curator music hitler follow megan root intensified date drop suggestion estimation season supremacy adidas available follower william seller tour fendi billion illustrates demographic psychologist alignment bet worth controversial individual royalty spend high breakfast listen medium leader box loyal conscience watch endorse perk washington paint extrinsic cyber american jewish foam claim post consciousness loss deplorable online element cannon unprofessional net popularity turn marriage product merchant resell tolerance project slide farrakhan start elizabeth author tie demand unscientific rough erode,0.9581,0.2465078060805259,9.51044091710758,0.4358678580678579,0,2023-11-28

CNN,Shannen Doherty’s new podcast will take on cancer as well as candid stories about her career,2023-11-28 20:54:00,Dan Heching,"Shannen Doherty isn’t letting any of the challenges life has thrown at her get in the way of launching an exciting new project.The “Beverly Hills, 90210” star, 52, is set to debut the new iHeartRadio podcast “Let’s Be Clear with Shannen Doherty” early next month, which will cover many aspects of her life, both professional and personal.Doherty told People in an interview published on Tuesday that those aspects will include her experiences living with cancer, and that it will “explore all the different phases and stages” of the disease, including “what it’s like to lose your hair (a) multitude of times, (and) how to stay authentic to yourself.”In June of this year, Doherty announced on social media that cancer had spread to her brain.Previously, the “Charmed” star was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 that went into remission two years later. In 2020, Doherty announced the cancer had returned, spread and was stage 4.This week, she told People that doctors will be among the guests she speaks to, and that the podcast is encouraging her on her journey, calling it “invigorating” and saying it “helps me for sure.”“When I’m working and when I’m creative, there’s no room for depression at all. It fuels me,” she said. “Working makes me so happy. Even my podcast producers were like, ‘Really? You’re going to do three episodes in one day? It’s a lot.’ And I was like, ‘I could do five in a day.’”In “Let’s Be Clear,” Doherty will also take on her career in its entirety, from “what it was like for me to work with Michael Landon on ‘Little House (on the Prairie)’” to her experiences during “the ’90210’ days” as well as making the 1988 classic teen film “Heathers.”“Let’s Be Clear with Shannen Doherty” will premiere on Wednesday, December 6.CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.",1809,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/entertainment/shannen-doherty-new-podcast/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hair stage month thrown hill doctor michael classic speaks episode guest spread contribute social excite announce invigorate december creative make launch year fuel clear medium explore breast include happy early june work life lisa house told living cover film time podcast respers france experience interview phase landon depression room entirety call producer publish stay remission different return report charm aspect cancer lose tuesday journey shannen iheartradio multitude diagnose premiere career authentic disease week encourage doherty star set professional debut day wednesday challenge prairie beverly,0.66245,0.0,5.562475247524748,0.4253006253006252,0,2023-11-28
CNN,The keffiyeh explained: How this scarf became a Palestinian national symbol,2023-11-28 18:13:00,Zoe Sottile,"Over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, three Palestinian college students were shot in Vermont, two of them while wearing keffiyehs, in a crime their families have said was “fueled by hate.”Although keffiyehs are worn across the Middle East, in recent decades they have come to be identified in particular as a symbol of Palestinian identity and resistance. At pro-Palestinian protests across the world amid the Israel-Hamas war, demonstrators have sported the scarves around their necks or used them to cover their faces.Originally worn by shepherds and nomadic farmers, the keffiyeh “has become an iconic piece of clothing globally worn by anti-colonialist revolutionaries, activists, and the like, while still worn in the traditional headwear fashion by elders and farmers,” said Majeed Malhas, a Palestinian-Canadian journalist and PhD candidate in anthropology at the University of Toronto.A keffiyeh — sometimes spelled kufiyya or kaffiyeh in English — is a traditional scarf worn across many parts of the Middle East. Typically, it is either black and white or red and white, featuring different patterns throughout and tassels on its edge.Wafa Ghnaim, a researcher and curator specializing in the history of Palestinian clothing, told CNN until the 1920s, keffiyehs — also called hattahs or shamaghs — were worn mostly by nomadic Bedouin men in historic Palestine.Ghnaim, who is a research fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, told CNN in her work she often sees 19th century keffiyehs made of cotton, silk and fine wool, and incorporating white, black, green and red threads.“All people, whether men or women, wore headdresses in this part of the world. Villagers and townspeople had different styles of headdress than those of the Bedouins,” she explained.“Bedouin men would fold the keffiyeh diagonally and secure it to their head using a ‘aqal or headrope.”In addition to acting as a visual marker of Bedouin identity, the scarves serve a practical purpose: They help protect the wearer from the fierce desert sun and sand.And the patterns woven into each keffiyeh, Malhas told CNN, “reflect different aspects of the land of Palestine, such as the olive tree and fishnet.”The red and white keffiyeh is also sometimes linked to Jordanian nationalism because British commanders used them as part of the uniform for the Desert Patrol, a Bedouin unit of the Arab Legion. But keffiyehs of all colors have been worn by Palestinian activists and resistance fighters, according to Malhas.In addition to the traditional style worn on the head, today the scarves are also seen worn around the neck and as shawls across the shoulders.For many Palestinians and people of Arab descent around the world, the keffiyeh serves as a crucial link to their culture.Dalia Jacobs, a Palestinian brand strategist and creative director, told CNN she wears a keffiyeh made in her hometown, Hebron, when she travels abroad.Wearing the keffiyeh feels “like carrying home on my shoulders,” she said, describing the scarf as “a symbol of resistance and existence.”A.S., a 26-year-old Palestinian-American living in North Carolina who asked to be identified only by her initials due to privacy concerns, said the keffiyeh is like “a child’s comfort blanket” for her.The keffiyeh “says who I am and carries my family’s history with me always,” she told CNN.Ghnaim similarly said the keffiyeh reminds her of her father, while tatreez — traditional Palestinian embroidery — reminds her of her mother. To combine the two pieces of Palestinian cultural heritage, she used traditional embroidery techniques to adorn her black and white keffiyeh.“My fondest memories are in making this keffiyeh, and wearing it with pride and joy for my beautiful people.”In addition to symbolizing cultural identity, the keffiyeh has also taken on a political dimension, like many other garments tied to cultural or religious heritage and nationalism.Ghnaim traced this political dimension to the 1930s. During the Arab Revolt, between 1936 and 1939, when Palestinians sought to end British occupation and establish their own independent country, Palestinians across social classes and religions wore the black and white keffiyeh to symbolize their solidarity, according to Ghnaim.During the 1960s, there was another resurgence in the keffiyeh as political symbol, with the scarf worn by both men and women. Yasser Arafat, who served for decades as the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was often pictured wearing the black and white keffiyeh, which further cemented the scarf as a symbol of the Palestinian national struggle.Leila Khaled, a former militant made famous by her role in a 1969 plane hijacking and member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, part of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was also often pictured wearing a keffiyeh wrapped around her hair and neck in the 1960s and 1970s.Malhas, who grew up as a second-generation Palestinian in Jordan in the 2000s, told CNN that wearing the black and white keffiyeh could be seen as a sign that he was “ungrateful” to Jordan as a host country. The scarf “was seen as “a symbol of defiance and pan-Arabism” and could be controversial due to its ties to Palestinian identity. “My family would be uneasy with me wearing it” in Jordan, he said.He recalled being harassed during middle school for wearing one. An older boy told him, “If you don’t like it here, just hop on a boat and leave.”At recent pro-Palestinian protests across the world, organizers have encouraged attendees to wear keffiyehs to show solidarity with Palestinian people. CNN previously reported that one protester in France said he was fined 135 euros for wearing a keffiyeh after the country banned all pro-Palestinian protests.But wearing the keffiyeh may also expose wearers to anti-Palestinian sentiment or Islamophobia: An attorney for the students shot in Burlington said he believed the students were targeted in part because they wore keffiyehs. And a woman in New York was arrested and charged with a hate crime after she allegedly accused a man wearing a keffiyeh of supporting Hamas and attacked him in early November. She has pleaded not guilty.In addition to serving as a symbol of national identity and resistance, keffiyehs have also made it into the world of mainstream fashion. In one episode of Sex and the City, Carrie Bradshaw sports a tank top mimicking the design of a keffiyeh. And both luxury and mainstream retailers have sold keffiyehs as fashion accessories, divorced from their history.But stripping the keffiyeh from its original context can be contentious. In 2021, Louis Vuitton sparked accusations of cultural appropriation when it debuted a $705 “keffieh stole,” according to multiple reports. The social media backlash reportedly forced the luxury brand to pull the item off its website. Louis Vuitton declined comment to multiple outlets at the time. CNN has reached out again for comment.Ghnaim urged wearers of the keffiyeh to do their research about the garment before wearing it.“Over the past 10 years, the keffiyeh has become appropriated by the fashion world without cultural attribution to its Palestinian origins,” she said.“Cultural appropriation leads to cultural erasure, and it is of utmost importance for those wearing this scarf to educate themselves on its meaning and history. It is not a garment that anyone can wear,” she explained. “It symbolizes Palestinian solidarity, liberation and freedom.”Malhas, on the other hand, said while non-Palestinians should be careful when wearing the keffiyeh in the traditional style worn by Bedouins, in general, non-Palestinians wearing the garment can be a “great show of solidarity.”",7725,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/style/style-palestinian-keffiyeh-explained/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,silk host yasser episode typically resistance palestinian item retailer social sex sentiment traditional shot headdress farmer color appropriation demonstrator patrol role elder diagonally fold uniform make spark brand sign descent great year accessory hijack fuel act symbolize feature feel green medium nationalism desert attorney context researcher part hattahs appropriate museum expose serf political symbolizes north thanksgiving student resurgence history townspeople tatreez phd cement picture tassel serve amid urge famous pull incorporate wore time utmost fond woman adorn due accusation hop occupation link home fierce comfort today fine joy neck style plane website cultural crucial cnn similarly ban revolutionary islamophobia describe careful reflect hand accord family cotton harass wrap call olive addition spell pride city tree previously keffiyehs report middle sought stole november protest sun sell privacy tie mimic anthropology past organization shawl identity arrest secure land attendee hamas shepherd encourage carolina independent embroidery specialize hate globally jordanian attack sport legion attribution hometown activist bedouin accuse luxury weekend commander english aqal contentious initial outlet keffiyeh university father hair fashion palestine strip east majeed red symbol tank allegedly class reminds erasure khaled visual ungrateful euro backlash controversial importance chairman creative believe fellow pattern country burlington force trace vuitton school malhas iconic crime curator holiday liberation piece target york comment technique wearer uneasy protect front heritage shoulder early boat popular organizer original national protester work marker militant wear kufiyya art scarf design defiance candidate blanket identify villager jordan director travel told british research living ghnaim cover educate headwear carry arafat recall beautiful unit worn metropolitan france charge child plead bradshaw purpose carrie general reach former strategist shamaghs boy world jacob journalist lead woven decline dimension hebron head wool show member different meaning black clothing kaffiyeh religion keffieh vermont aspect nomadic practical solidarity decade fighter mother origin arab grow combine white religious establish concern particular revolt multiple century explain mainstream historic recent college fin reportedly debut divorce louis support top garment memory,0.3847,0.116504854368932,11.433859522085443,0.3546469853170884,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig address ‘Barbie’ sequel buzz,2023-11-28 17:01:00,Alli Rosenbloom,"It seems that a “Barbie” movie sequel might not happen anytime soon – if at all – but the film’s director Greta Gerwig isn’t completely ruling it out.“I mean, at the moment we are at zero,” Gerwig told Entertainment Tonight on the Gotham Awards red carpet on Monday when asked if a sequel is in the works.The Oscar-nominated director went on to admit that she’s “tapped out” at the moment, but stopped short of giving a hard “no” to a potential sequel.“Life is long,” she added. “You never know.”Margot Robbie, who produced the film and starred as the iconic Mattel doll, also weighed in on the buzz surrounding another “Barbie” movie, telling the Associated Press earlier this month that they “put everything into this one.”“We didn’t build it to be a trilogy or something,” Robbie said, adding, “Greta put everything into this movie, so I can’t imagine what would be next.”“Barbie” stars Robbie in the titular role alongside Ryan Gosling’s Ken, and follows Barbie as she works through an existential crisis in Barbieland.It comes as no surprise that moviegoers far and wide would be excited at the prospect of an encore given how massively successful the “Barbie” movie was when it premiered in July.The summer blockbuster raked in a remarkable $1.03 billion at the global box office within the first few weeks of its release, according to official Warner Bros. estimates, making Gerwig the first solo female director with a billion-dollar movie. (“Barbie” was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)“It’s been an amazing year,” Gerwig said on Monday. “You always hope that things connect and you believe in them, but this was beyond anything I could have foreseen.”",1721,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/entertainment/margot-robbie-greta-gerwig-barbie-sequel/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month company trilogy billion red margot entertainment carpet press tonight produce moment excite solo award stop role movie make believe year existential parent iconic mattel hard discovery connect surround ryan global encore work potential life add official massively director told blockbuster film box give put ken doll surprise admit bros estimate moviegoer cnn barbie tapped imagine zero build alongside long accord robbie release associate follow greta amaze successful female summer gosling weigh short foreseen sequel earlier week warner buzz star completely gerwig gotham monday anytime prospect hope remarkable ruling happen distribute crisis office rake wide premier titular,0.9826,0.5229517722254502,6.909010989010991,0.4596590909090909,0,2023-11-28
NPR,"Investor Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of Warren Buffett, has died",2023-11-28 16:34:00,David Gura,"With Warren Buffett, Munger built Berkshire Hathaway into a multi-billion dollar behemoth. ""They complemented each other in their approach to investments in a very nice way,"" says David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland. Munger was a ""value investor,"" who liked to buy stocks when a company's share price was low relative to its fundamental value. But he also believed in the power of trusted brands — and in valuing growth. Over the years, Berkshire Hathaway made large investments in dozens of household names, including Kraft Heinz, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola. Its portfolio included car companies, grocery stores, and insurers. ""Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation,"" Buffett said, in a statement. For Munger, simplicity was a guiding principle. ""I can't think of a single example in my whole life where keeping it simple has worked against us,"" he told Yahoo! Finance in an interview. ""We've made mistakes, but they weren't because we kept it simple."" With Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger built Berkshire Hathaway into a multibillion-dollar behemoth. Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images hide caption With Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger built Berkshire Hathaway into a multibillion-dollar behemoth. Munger grew up in Omaha, Neb., not far from Buffett's childhood home. According to Kass, a local physician introduced them to each other, and ""they hit it off immediately."" After serving in the U.S. Army, Munger attended Harvard Law School, and he went on to found Munger, Tolles & Olson, a law firm headquartered in Los Angeles. Today, Buffett may be better known, but Kass says Munger played a big role in what was a really unique business partnership. Munger was a straight shooter, with a dry sense of humor, and Berkshire Hathaway shareholders saw his personality on display at the company's annual meetings in Omaha, where he and Buffett fielded questions for hours on end. Often, Buffett answered questions at length. Then, Munger chimed in with something pithy or a perfect one-liner. The audience roared. According to Lawrence Cunningham, a law professor at The George Washington University, Munger was more than a sounding board for Buffett. He pushed him to consider companies that had potential to grow, and he pushed back on ideas he considered to be half-baked. ""I think Charlie's biggest contribution — besides being a good friend, and that stuff — was knowing when Warren needed to be told not to do something,"" he says, noting Buffett gave Munger the nickname ""The Abominable No Man."" Munger spent much of his life in California, where he pursued a few side projects. He bought and ran another company, called The Daily Journal. He was a philanthropist. And he dabbled in architecture. In 2021, a dormitory Munger designed at the University of California, Santa Barbara, faced a lot of blowback. It would have thousands of bedrooms, bust most of them wouldn't have windows. Munger suggested that would encourage students to congregate in common spaces.

Washington Post,Book explores the alleys of Washington and the lives lived there,2023-11-28 16:26:00,John Kelly,"Back 40 years ago when I was a D.C. delivery driver, I loved alleys. They were great little shortcuts through downtown and shady oases to grab a snack or sneak a smoke.Kim Prothro Williams loves alleys, too. The architectural historian loves Washington’s alleys so much — and knows so much about them — that they’re the subject of her latest book: “Hidden Alleyways of Washington, DC: A History” (Georgetown University Press).It’s a handsome hardcover book, full of photos illustrating the range of the District’s alleys and exploring what made them a national embarrassment (yesterday) and desired patches of real estate (today).Now, when we’re talking about Washington’s alleys, we’re not talking about those suburban microstreets beyond the back fence where trash cans are stored. These alleys are quirky artifacts in Pierre L’Enfant’s design for the city. Narrow passageways — 10 or 15 feet wide — led from the edges of a block into an H- or I-shaped configuration of wider, 30-foot passages in the interior.“It was probably pretty much assumed that houses would face the front [of the block] and the back would be used for accessory buildings, sheds, kitchens, housing for enslaved people and gardens,” Williams said.Nature may abhor a vacuum, but developers love it. And that’s what these hidden spaces were: vacuums just waiting for the right moment to burst to life.“There was a huge influx of population before, during and after the Civil War,” Williams said. Many of the newcomers had been enslaved in the South.“We were just completely ill prepared for the numbers of people coming in,” Williams said. “People were just building houses anywhere they could.”That included in the alleys. Ramshackle structures built of discarded material, wood mostly, were thrown up overnight. Many families shared the same small space. The backlash grew quickly.“There are newspaper articles and reports as early as 1865 describing the miserable conditions of the houses in alleys,” Williams said.Thus began a nearly 70-year campaign to rid Washington of its alley dwellings. When the city decreed in 1871 that all new homes be made of brick, not wood, developers complied, constructing thousands of 12-foot-wide, two-story, four-room brick structures in the District’s alleys.Today’s tiny-house aficionados might think these cute as a button, but the houses were not connected to water or sewer systems. Later, electricity would bypass them, too, as would trash collection.The alley houses were neglected by the city and by the people who’d built them, Williams said.“Property owners didn't keep up the houses,” she said. “None of the regulations that did exist were ever enforced. That's why the buildings really fell into such terrible condition.”Other things had sprouted in Washington’s alleys, too: stables, carriage houses, garages, workshops. Some of these were creatively repurposed. In her book, Williams tells the story of the Krazy Kat Klub, a Prohibition-era cafe founded in a former garage or stable on Green Court, near Thomas Circle. Its impresario was the delightfully named Cleon Throckmorton, an artist eager to attract a bohemian crowd, or as he put it, “people interested in ‘creative work.’”Authorities raided the Krazy Kat several times before Throckmorton eventually shut it down and moved to New York City for a career as a set designer.Meanwhile, pressure had increased on alley homes, with social reformers pointing out the unhealthy conditions that existed there. In 1934, Congress passed the Alley Dwelling Act, directing that the homes be demolished by 1944. World War II intervened and the deadline was extended until 1953.But something familiar had happened in the intervening years: Wealthy people had discovered the charms of the alley.“In those intervening years, many individuals saw the alley dwellings and said, ‘Wow, we could fix these up and move in,’” Williams said. “Individuals, entrepreneurs and real estate agents in neighborhoods like Capitol Hill and Georgetown started buying the alley dwellings, bringing in water and electricity, renovating and then renting them or selling them to White professionals.”In 1955, the Alley Dwelling Act was overturned. Today, funky shops and restaurants dot Blagden Alley and Naylor Court in Northwest. A former stable behind a house on Connecticut Avenue NW has been reborn as a Pilates studio. I suspect the poor families who had no other option than to live in an alley at the turn of the 20th century would be surprised to see their once-despised houses turned into Pilates studios, cocktail bars and urban chic homes.I have a feeling Cleon Throckmorton would fit right in, though.(Kim Prothro Williams is giving a book talk at the DC History Center on Dec. 7 at 5:30 p.m., along with Alison K. [Kim] Hoagland, author of “The Row House in Washington, DC: A History.” For information, visit dchistory.org.)The social reformers who fought to clear D.C.’s alleys had their hearts in the right place — the homes were unhealthy — but they didn’t realize how hard it would be to find affordable alternatives. The challenge continues today. That’s one reason so many people experience homelessness.",5171,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/28/district-alleys-book/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,shed story point narrow hill fence information pass sewer handsome creatively press yesterday delightfully social wealthy moment reborn decreed make center real illustrate great affordable year wait accessory clear back prepared burst act feel green alternative stable raid explore neglect repurposed throckmorton circle blagden attract abhor interested turn embarrassment delivery include small alleyway assume water quirky bohemian shortcut late history capitol kat familiar property huge regulation reason kitchen time oasis configuration cafe edge home system microstreets klub today wider trash northwest shut crowd alley find avenue discover terrible describe start agent restaurant snack continue rid family court buying comply homelessness rent city newspaper move nw share love author report cocktail sell direct demolish structure artist probably georgetown entrepreneur set dc architectural estate ramshackle developer eager fell happen wow found talk congress studio fought photo extend wide full miserable challenge patch space number grab university hidden bypass cute bring thrown desire population subject vacuum enslave neighborhood sneak bar thomas pressure backlash housing creative passage renovate button option eventually range book shady construct hard overturn place civil suspect campaign york downtown connect garden begin pilate carriage block newcomer front washington early national built urban house garage design building alison overnight ago realize impresario influx fix historian pierre shop aficionado dot give put foot live experience row former passageway district hardcover exist cleon pretty poor world visit krazy authority lead driver connecticut unhealthy dwelling charm store deadline reformer enforce dwell suburban workshop electricity grow funky career hoagland discard white prothro completely chic sprout individual century thousand fit naylor surprised heart wood owner increase condition article intervene artifact material brick williams enfant,0.9733,0.0,8.942097902097903,0.4674802049802049,0,2023-11-28
Washington Post,Self-serve snack bars are coming to a flight near you,2023-11-28 16:08:00,Sofia Andrade,"In the future of aviation, more peckish passengers may be able to rise from their seats and snag a snack without the help of a flight attendant.Starting Thursday, United will become the latest airline to offer grab-and-go stations for economy fliers. The service will begin with select routes from Chicago O’Hare International Airport as part of the rollout of United’s new Airbus A321neo plane.According to United, these kiosks will include a “limited supply of water and the snacks offered during the complimentary service,” with items like fruit bars from That’s It, Undercover chocolate quinoa crisps and Savory snack mix. Those items will become available only after flight attendants have made their first pass, United said.These self-serve stations are just the most recent iteration from a major U.S. airline on long- and medium-haul domestic flights. The JetBlue Pantry has been available since 2014, when it was called “The Marketplace.” It was rebranded in 2019, when JetBlue introduced the Airbus A321neo. Self-serve snacks are now offered on some of the “aircraft that fly JetBlue’s longest flight routes,” including an A321ceo, according to an airline representative.“Passengers really like this. And when passengers are happy, the crew is happy, and when the crew is happy, passengers are happier,” said Harry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of the research and advisory firm Atmosphere Research Group. The do-it-yourself snack stations, he added, “make it easier for passengers to have more enjoyable flights, and to reduce the burden on the cabin crew having to run back and forth to serve individual passengers.”Not all experts agree, however, that self-service snacks have the customer’s best interest in mind.Robert W. Mann, an airline industry analyst and consultant, called the new feature as just “the latest airline manifestation” of self-service options.Mann gave the example of Delta and American Airlines, who, in the late ’90s and early 2000s, provided grab-and-go meal bags at the gate before boarding. “These days, those amenities seem generous, though at the time they replaced hot entrees served in the cabin,” Mann said. He added that both the American “Bistro Bag” and Delta “Sky Deli” options were “pretty much panned if not reviled by passengers.”United and JetBlue’s all-plane snack stations can be read as part of a longer trend toward airline optimization (and consequent cost-cutting). “The self-service is part of a broader trend just in customer service overall. And you see it across other parts of the airline as well,” said Clark Johns, an airline expert and consultant at Alton Aviation Consultancy. It’s evident from airline investment in self-service mobile apps for check-in and flight management, as well as the spread of self-bag-check kiosks, he said.“It’s sort of a good utilization, as well, of the cabin crew’s time to give more touchpoints and time to those customers that need it,” Johns added.Harteveldt agreed. “What these self-service pantries do is help the airlines do a better job of pleasing customers,” he said, calling it “empowerment to the passenger.”Experts agreed more traditional refreshment service won’t likely change in the near future. Flight attendants still need to serve alcohol and hot meals, after all. But a more widespread adoption of snack bars could reduce strain on the flight crew in the long term.“It likely depends on costs, customer acceptance, comments and flight attendant post-flight write-ups,” Mann said. He cautioned, though, that such a change could be “an inconvenience [or] annoyance to customers, especially aisle seat customers, sitting close to galleys where other passengers queue up in the aisles to ‘grab and go’ back to their own seats.”U.S. airlines are generally already working with the minimum number of flight attendants per trip, Harteveldt said. For safety reasons, the Federal Aviation Administration requires one flight attendant for every 50 passengers. That means there’s not as much room to cut staff as there would be with the installation of self-service check-in and bag-tagging machines at the airport, for example.Whether more airlines take the leap to add self-service snack bars on their domestic flights is still up in the air. Having such a service takes up precious real estate on planes; some of American Airlines’ A321neos for example, use spare mid-cabin space for an extra bathroom instead.On newer aircraft like the A321neo or the Bombardier CRJ-550, a 50-person plane that United uses for its most premium routes, a trend toward more flexible configurations makes these types of self-services possible, potentially opening the door for more airlines to join the trend as they add new planes.In the meantime, having these self-service stations on select airlines could help separate them from competitors. According to Harteveldt, it is a “small but meaningful point of differentiation in an industry that long ago became a homogenous blob of sameness.”Research has shown that even the most loyal fliers are often picking the airline they’ll fly on “trip to trip,” Harteveldt said. Features such as free WiFi, better in-flight entertainment or on-demand snack options, though they seem small, can add up from a customer’s point of view.",5288,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/11/28/united-flights-snack-bar/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point optimization potentially run international harry mobile passenger spread customer item type separate administration possible traditional kiosk revile united american rise make real airline snag enjoyable back mann feature installation safety cabin industry broader chocolate seat john generous attendant part analyst include small consultant reduce economy close water firm amenity change expert burden management late happier atmosphere serve alcohol pantry reason savory boarding airbus time flier configuration especially undercover plane bathroom utilization premium flexible long accord snack provide harteveldt bistro blob clark call read jetblue generally easy available hare aircraft complimentary machine service quinoa crisp apps trip estate select empowerment rebranded thursday newer advisory refreshment view aisle rollout strain flight space opening inconvenience domestic grab number free longer station hot cut queue extra entertainment fly manifestation interest bar fruit cost depends future replace airport option limited consultancy require alton comment president begin sort happy offer early work galley add job wifi ago travel research adoption minimum competitor agree deli give sky trend meaningful spare meal chicago caution room peckish pretty introduce entree aviation differentiation investment major touchpoints show iteration annoyance meantime pick delta pan bombardier mix leap homogenous consequent route join group air evident individual acceptance recent loyal bag precious supply federal widespread day gate staff crew,0.99445,0.0,10.14864097363083,0.5005733353947639,0,2023-11-28
CNN,"FTC can seek tough new restrictons on Meta’s use of personal data, federal judge rules",2023-11-28 16:04:00,Brian Fung,"A federal judge will not block the US government from expanding a landmark $5 billion privacy settlement with Instagram-parent Meta, paving the way for the Federal Trade Commission to propose tough new rules on how the social media giant can monetize user data.The decision Monday by District Judge Timothy Kelly allows the FTC to move ahead with a proposal banning Meta from profiting off data it collects from users under the age of 18.If approved, the limitation could significantly restrict Meta’s data-driven business, particularly as it seeks to court younger users and to grow in new product areas, such as virtual reality.The FTC has also suggested tougher rules governing Meta’s use of facial recognition technology and forcing Meta to halt the rollout of any new products or services until third-party audits can demonstrate that Meta is complying with the settlement’s privacy obligations.The package of potential restrictions would represent some of the most significant impositions on Meta’s business since the 2020 privacy order that resolved a federal probe into the company’s Cambridge Analytica privacy fiasco. (In 2018, Meta admitted to the inadvertent exposure of up to 87 million users’ information to the political analysis firm.)And it would draw a sharp contrast to Congress, where US lawmakers have spent years fruitlessly debating legislation in response to allegations that Meta has harmed the mental health and privacy of teens.Multiple whistleblowers have come forward alleging that Meta knew its apps could be harmful to users’ well-being, and multiple states have filed lawsuits against the company accusing it of failing to do enough to protect users. Meta has said that it invests heavily in user well-being and that it has developed 30 tools for parents and teens to manage their experiences with the company’s products.In a court filing Tuesday afternoon, Meta said it would appeal Kelly’s decision to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.Earlier on Tuesday, in a statement, a Meta spokesperson said Kelly’s decision “does not address the substance of the FTC’s allegations, which are without merit. By the end of this year, we will have invested $5 billion since 2019 in a rigorous privacy program that has embedded privacy into our products from the start.”Meta had previously called the FTC proposal “a political stunt” that singles out Meta “while allowing Chinese companies like TikTok to operate without constraint on American soil.”The FTC declined to comment on the ruling. Last week, the agency issued an order giving Meta a deadline of Dec. 11 to respond to the FTC’s proposal to expand the settlement.In Monday’s opinion, Kelly wrote that the FTC retains the authority to reopen and amend the order affecting Meta without the need for prior court approval.Meta had argued that the US District Court for the District of Columbia should be the one to decide whether the FTC could reopen the matter.Despite Meta’s appeal, Monday’s decision “appears carefully crafted and likely to be sustained,” according to Paul Gallant, an industry analyst at the market research firm TD Cowen. It’s unclear when the FTC may finalize its proposed rules, Gallant added, but it could occur in the spring of 2024.Meta could still attempt to challenge any eventual FTC rule changes in federal court.",3329,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/tech/federal-judge-ftc-meta-personal-data/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,fruitlessly rule legislation company information billion collect ftc program lawsuit judge kelly opinion stunt embed tough data social contrast seek technology draw significant attempt health reopen tool american retains chinese ahead recognition forward occur cowen year merit force prior parent carefully commission state harmful medium debate developed fiasco industry monetize allegation comment halt analysis constraint represent order block analyst finalize protect heavily age potential political firm million add operate change government expand timothy virtual whistleblower statement afternoon research invests landmark resolve affect file young give business inadvertent admit experience propose columbia spokesperson tiktok craft eventual district appeal ban substance paul fail decide accord gallant court argue proposal call address filing imposition comply product agency move authority invest previously facial decline giant demonstrate user deadline mental rigorous settlement privacy allege tuesday restriction sharp respond service knew significantly grow td probe decision single amend week particularly apps issue pave restrict tougher profit harm dc multiple package monday response govern spent ruling unclear analytica area lawmaker congress federal accuse spring approve limitation sustain trade exposure manage write suggest challenge rollout audit cambridge market meta,-0.28505,0.0,11.140364842454396,0.4042033235581622,0,2023-11-28
NPR,"John Cale, ever restless, keeps moving out of his comfort zone",2023-11-28 15:29:00,Manuela López Restrepo,"Who is he? The Welsh musician, producer and avant-garde royalty was one of the founding members of The Velvet Underground, and had a part in some the most iconic experimental music of the late 20th century. Want more on musical legends? Listen to Consider This dive into the life of the late Tony Bennett. What's he doing now? At the age of 81, Cale is still performing, collaborating and finding inspiration. The titular track from Cale's album. What's he saying? Cale spoke with All Things Considered host Juana Summers earlier this year about the longevity of his music career. On why he wanted to work with these specific artists: Most of the artists that joined me on the tracks, they had their own atmosphere to them. And I didn't try and push them in any direction. I just let them be and really inhale the spirit that they brought to the song. The emotion of the song really was joined by their performance. Weyes Blood has a very deep and emotional voice. She just warms the track. And Animal Collective really has this multi-voice personality. So I laughed a lot when we did Everlasting Days. A post shared by John Cale (@therealjohncale) I've always enjoyed Sylvan Esso's style of harmonizing. And I was hoping that our paths might cross, but as I was putting the finishing touches on this song, I got a call saying Amelia and Nick were in L.A. and would love to drop by and say hello. And it was then I thought that the perfect time to see if they'd want to guest on the track that I was working on. I guess that's the perfect example of serendipity, but it was a natural fit. And I couldn't be happier with the results. On being influenced by trap and hip-hop: I mean, I sort of fell in love with hip-hop. It has so many lively approaches to songwriting. Hip-hop is the avant-garde of today. They are unconventional approaches to emotions and creativity. They have no respect for solos and for all the other usual trappings that you have in songwriting. On pushing himself past musical precedents he has set before: I realized a long time ago that if you start a song with just any kind of melody or rhythm that you have, you don't just stop because you haven't got a solution yet. You're better off working at it and helping it advance its ideas, whatever they are. And your audience is then your friend. So, what now?

Washington Post,Omid Scobie’s ‘Endgame’ has arrived. Where are the royal revelations?,2023-11-28 15:27:00,Autumn Brewington,"For fans of the British royal family, the latest book by Omid Scobie, “Endgame: Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy’s Fight for Survival,” seems a well-timed treat. After all, Netflix just began streaming the final season of “The Crown.” Scobie is the journalist-commentator who co-wrote “Finding Freedom,” the high-profile 2020 tell-all about Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s relationship. Now, Scobie appears poised to dish on the rest of the Windsors — to take readers behind the scenes of Queen Elizabeth II’s final months, the frosty family response to Harry’s best-selling memoir and the coronation of King Charles III and his mistress-turned-consort, Camilla.Except, the royal tea spilled here isn’t exactly hot.To be fair, there is news, including:These tidbits and others, including that Charles’s pampered proclivities include ironed shoelaces, are packed amid familiar fare, rehashed from news reports and other books. Sometimes recounting facts is useful, like when details are less widely known, such as when Scobie revisits the cash-for-honors scandals at Charles’s charity, acknowledging that it was not illegal but was hardly a good look to accept bags of cash (yes, cash) from a former Qatari prime minister, or 1 million pounds from relatives of Osama bin Laden.But this is not a book of bombshells — more like boomlets punctuating Scobie’s analysis of recent events. (Spoiler: The Windsors Must Change.) Even some Harry and Meghan content feels less than insightful; having done their Netflix docuseries and other projects to ensure income, the couple are poised to look ahead, Scobie writes, which is music to royal ears.The book, which starts slow, revisits dynastic drama by character (Camilla and the ghost of Diana each get a chapter) and issue (such as Britain’s tabloid media culture), circling back to some themes again and again. Scobie presents Charles, at 75, as too old to be much more than a transitional figure to the next reign and William, heir to the throne, now focused on his future role. Points likely to stand out to royal watchers:Scobie recounts tabloid reporting in 2019 about William’s rumored affair with Rose Hanbury, the Marchioness of Cholmondeley, an aristocrat who lives close to William’s country residence. “For William, there was no ‘take it on the chin’ advice like Meghan received during her media onslaughts,” Scobie writes. “A senior Palace source said at the time, ‘We have to make this stop.’”Catherine gets her own “Skilled Survivors” chapter but emerges as a royal Stepford wife. Devoted mother? Check. Perfect princess pose? Check. Her promotion of early-childhood development is laudable but “seemed a shade performative.” “In the instances where criticism would be fair, such as carrying out fewer engagements than other senior royals, or the fact that she has had five different private secretaries in six years (one, I’m told, simply found the role ‘uninspiring and frustrating’), you’d be unlikely to read about it in any British newspaper,” he writes. As for her relationship with sister-in-law Meghan, according to one source, Catherine “spent more time talking about Meghan than talking to her.”Charles was reportedly persuaded by his sister, Anne, to evict Harry and Meghan from their home at Frogmore Cottage; meanwhile, the king’s disgraced brother, Prince Andrew, remains in the Windsor mansion he leases from the crown for well below market rates. Andrew’s shady dealings with autocrats and ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein got the prince booted from his role as a special trade envoy years before his royal titles were rescinded amid allegations of sexual abuse by an Epstein victim. (The prince, who settled the lawsuit in February 2022, has denied any wrongdoing.)“During the most heightened moments of Andrew’s downfall,” Scobie writes, “Charles was tearful over fears for the shamed duke’s mental health.” The king’s soft spot for his younger brother, despite scandals, is starkly contrasted with the royal family’s indifference toward Meghan’s mental health struggles.Even casual observers of royal goings-on cannot read “Endgame” without being conscious of Scobie’s past work and the criticism that he is a mouthpiece for Harry and Meghan. Scobie establishes his perspective in the prologue: “In the past I, like others, have held back on revealing some of the darker truths at the heart of the institution of the British monarchy because I didn’t want to lose my insider position or my contacts, or experience some of the threats made toward me. … Parts of this book will burn my bridges for good. But to tell the full story, there’s no holding back.” Scobie denies speaking for Harry and Meghan, but he acknowledges interactions with their team — and writes that Meghan herself called him in 2018 after learning that he was being harassed online.Scobie nails the inherent complexity of the palace position today when he writes, of a 1951 royal event, that the monarchy had “made looking back an essential component of the national mechanism for looking forward.” What made sense some 70 years ago no longer works, he argues, especially after the 2022 death of Elizabeth, Britain’s much-revered queen. That can be true while also, like much of “Endgame,” not being news. Whatever this book gets right about the unsustainability of palace infighting or blind spots, it is not a playbook for a royal path forward.Autumn Brewington is an associate editor in The Washington Post’s opinion section and the author of the Post Elizabeth newsletter on changes at the British royal palace.Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy’s Fight for SurvivalBy Omid Scobie",5669,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/11/28/endgame-royal-book-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point story frosty news harry accept widely threat lawsuit post opinion darker source acknowledge scobie project sex contrast illegal moment health final survivor argues pound inside role check insider chapter rise make diana burn year sussex netflix back dealing advice freedom feel settle medium mechanism fear income poise circle king instance analysis william throne part packed skilled include emerges unsustainability affair revisits path close observer transitional million iron anne rate ghost change development late mansion familiar laudable amid team detail endgame downfall time scandal duke especially focus home wrongdoing devote today find omid start accord reader family brother harass windsor ensure shoelace meghan call sexual indifference deny newspaper nail read disgrace music simply author residence rest report tabloid dish associate cottage lose insightful mental iii tie writes past soft sham perfect essential truth rescind memoir issue qatari slow event stepford spot aristocrat princess contact spent tidbit learn found talk epstein spoiler boomlets section full scene market duchess starkly stream relative spill survival heighten evict month perspective longer charles receive secretary autocrat boot couple infighting britain engagement tea establishes docuseries persuade future bridge ahead reporting prince victim palace country present remains book mouthpiece character shady private onslaught allegation offender inherent marchioness begin fare washington relationship season national work convict lease playbook life blind denies fair february figure heir andrew ago british told crown watcher envoy editor frogmore pose catherine brewington complexity hold carry cash despite rumor proclivity abuse young recount death minister experience osama coronation former punctuate bombshell prime monarchy jeffrey elizabeth promotion queen criticism camilla dynastic charity royal prologue theme reign newsletter interaction special different tearful drama survivalby institution mother casual senior treat hanbury held component pamper cholmondeley wife response content recent culture uninspiring heart fact reportedly bag title rehash position fight chin acknowledges sister trade speak conscious stand reveal frustrate shade,-0.95305,0.2116775445404833,8.928904977375563,0.4352040816326531,0,2023-11-28
Politico,Why a Mike Johnson campaign ad is running on an Iranian website,2023-11-28 15:20:00,Alfred Ng,"A campaign ad for House Speaker Mike Johnson pops up on the website of a sanctioned Iranian company. Ads for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries appear on a Russian porn website.Researchers at Adalytics, an ad-tracking analysis firm, were able to document dozens of examples of political and other ads appearing in inappropriate locations on the internet, thanks to an issue with Google’s advertising network.The examples, several of which were confirmed by POLITICO, point to the global difficulty of policing just where and how web ads run — with potentially embarrassing consequences, or even illegal ones if money goes to a sanctioned company or nation.Johnson and Jeffries did not respond to requests for comment.Because their advertising campaigns are run through Google, the candidates would have no way of knowing their names were appearing on sanctioned websites. Google said no money was routed to the sites.Since the researchers began to circulate their report privately last week, Google has removed the advertising capabilities on many of the websites discovered by Adalytics.The embarrassing placement is the result of the way Google’s search-driven ads work. When advertisers launch an ad campaign based on Google Search, they’re paying for their ads to pop up next to search results on the tech giant’s platform. If you search for “Democrat” on Google’s main page, for example, an ad for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee could pop up.But Google also serves those ads up to third-party websites with a Google-powered search bar embedded on their pages. The search bar is available for free to anyone building a website, including Iranian and Russian companies.When POLITICO searched for “Democrat” on an Iranian website, the first result that returned was an ad for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, explicitly stating that the ad was paid for by the organization.A search for “Republican” on the same page returned an ad for Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, paid for by her advocacy group Stand For America.Neither Haley’s campaign nor the DCCC responded to requests for comment.According to a Google spokesperson, the company didn’t pay any of the sanctioned websites or adult content pages. Google has policies to prevent such sites from being able to profit from its ads, even if they have the search bars installed on their pages.The advertisers do not pay Google unless the search ads are clicked on, and the web hosts do not receive any cut of that revenue unless Google approves them for its monetization platform, AdSense for Search.“Websites who merely implement [the Google search bar] do not get any ad revenue from those ads,” said Dan Taylor, Google’s vice president of ads, in a statement.In compiling its report, Adalytics scanned for websites containing Google’s search engine tool between October 2022 and this October, and found more than 51,000 pages using it. About 390 of them appeared to be adult content pages, according to the report.Ads for politicians appeared on porn websites alongside sexually explicit images of “Family Guy” characters.Adalytics also found recruitment ads for the FBI, the U.S. Army and the National Security Agency served up on Iranian and Russian websites — including an Iranian website and a Russian website listed on the Office of Foreign Assets Control as sanctioned entities.Neither the Department of Defense nor the NSA responded to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment on behalf of the FBI.“The very concerning part about all of this is the extreme nature of some of these sites,” Ratko Vidakovic, the founder of AdProfs, an adtech research and advisory firm, said. “It’s beyond what most people would imagine is acceptable in an ad network.”Ads for liquor were also displayed on children’s websites, if related terms were entered in the search. Two kids’ pages that Adalytics flagged were marketed as child-friendly search engines.“This is unacceptable, and Google must put an end to this,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said in a statement in response to the report.The ad placements on sanctioned websites are raising concerns from lawmakers both in the U.S. and the European Union.“Google’s advertising algorithms demand scrutiny,” European Parliament member Paul Tang said in a statement. “The EU Commission must investigate whether and how much money is changing hands alongside these ad placements.”Sen. Mark Warner has raised concerns about Google’s advertising issues in the past, drawing attention to ads monetizing Covid-19 concerns and how ad fraud can be used to spread political disinformation.Warner, who has been briefed on the Adalytics report, said in a statement the findings should be a “final straw for the government to take action to clean up this market.”Political campaigns are generally careful about where their ads can end up, often using tools like blocklists to ensure that their calls to action are reaching the right people.“Candidates and politicians maintain their image very carefully, and where their advertisements show up is a portion of that,” Mark Jablonowski, the managing partner of Democratic advertising firm DSPolitical, said.While these improper ad placements could be potentially damaging for campaigns, the candidates themselves haven’t done anything wrong, Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, said.“The campaigns are doing the right thing by advertising on the most popular search engine in the world,” Wilson said. “This speaks more to the fact that Google is allowing ads to be run on these types of pages.”",5609,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/28/campiagn-ads-mike-johnson-google-00128910,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point partner potentially flag leader run minority company host speaks image straw embed spread type illegal draw adalytics nature demand tool final adult vice jeffries investigate engine commission carefully digital politician result researcher improper analysis part internet advocacy google include behalf serf extreme platform political firm site change justice government circulate request johnson statement explicit serve adsense russian nikki maintain implement wrong spokesperson enter website democratic discover paul imagine careful alongside paid hand accord iranian compile hakeem politico security family ensure parliament approves call privately agency report generally advertisement adtech available speaker embarrass october past location dozen sexually issue warner profit web briefed search document pay found revenue office advisory democrat action market scan free tech scrutiny founder blocklists money european receive recruitment foreign cut dspolitical wilson adprofs capability army bar pop explicitly rout guy republican instal contain launch policy state monetize liquor campaign comment portion president blackburn begin inappropriate global algorithm monetization raise popular related national work base vidakovic finding house building candidate acceptable consequence tang mark difficulty research kid ratko damage advertising police asset displayed put child attention reach eric remove fbi committee dccc sanction jablonowski strategist page porn taylor list world clean decline show nsa giant member return fraud clicked haley placement defense respond term advertiser control week unacceptable prevent concern group congressional response department content fact confirm lawmaker marsha mike manage stand presidential,0.7629,0.0534854697807095,11.463817097415507,0.4186507936507936,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Robert De Niro claims his speech was censored by the Gotham Awards and Apple: ‘How dare they do that’,2023-11-28 14:46:00,Marianne Garvey,"Robert De Niro alleges a speech he prepared to deliver at the Gotham Awards in New York City on Monday night was censored by the event’s organizers and Apple.De Niro spoke as part of the Gotham Historical Icon and Creator Tribute for the Martin Scorsese-directed film, “Killers of the Flower Moon” in which the actor stars. Apple TV+ is the film’s distributor.CNN has reached out to Apple’s film division and the Gotham Awards for comment.The Oscar-winning actor and frequent Scorsese collaborator appeared frustrated while at the podium as he read from a teleprompter. After a short video played, he claimed the first part of his speech had been removed.“The beginning of my speech was edited, cut out and I didn’t know about it. And I want to read it,” De Niro, prompting cheers from the room.He then pulled up his remarks on his phone and read aloud to the audience.“History isn’t history anymore,” he said. “Truth is not truth. Even facts are being replaced by alternative facts and driven by conspiracy theories and ugliness. In Florida, young students are taught that slaves developed skills which can be applied for their personal benefit.”De Niro was referencing new Florida education standards for the state’s Black history curriculum that sparked controversy when introduced earlier this year.De Niro continued, “The entertainment industry isn’t immune to this festering disease. The Duke, John Wayne, famously said of Native Americans, ‘I don’t feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them.’”“Killers of the Flower Moon” is a crime drama set in 1920s Oklahoma during which Osage Nation members were murdered after oil was discovered on tribal land and White opportunists sought control of their mineral rights.Without mentioning him by name, De Niro called out former President Donald Trump.“Lying has become just another tool in the charlatan’s arsenal. The former president lied to us more than 30,000 times during his four years in office, and he’s keeping up the pace in his current campaign of retribution. But with all his lies, he can’t hide his soul. He attacks the weak, destroys the gifts of nature, and shows disrespect, for example, by using ‘Pocahontas’ as a slur,” referring to Trump calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren by the Native American woman’s name.He closed his remarks by taking aim at the Gotham Awards and Apple.“This is where I came in and I saw that they edited all that,” De Niro said as he read his prepared remarks, adding he had intended to thank organizers and the studio. “But I don’t really feel like thanking them at all for what they did. How dare they do that, actually.”De Niro’s remarks follow Jon Stewart’s show, “The Problem with Jon Stewart,” on Apple TV+ coming to an end over disagreement between the host and the company about the subject matter of three episodes planned for a third season. Those topics included China, Israel and artificial intelligence, CNN reported last month.",2948,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/entertainment/robert-de-niro-gotham-awards-speech/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month company host subject cut destroys episode entertainment nation artificial driven oil aloud played night conspiracy moon skill niro warren nature award robert tool american stewart phone replace disagreement florida spark gift away pace country great year israel matter state prepared feel crime alternative developed industry campaign john york president begin part jon include retribution organizer season close slur podium murder add student teleprompter osage history spoke topic prompt standard fester film pull martin time woman dare duke young anymore mention edit reference wrong remark scorsese trump reach former plan cnn creator oklahoma division ugliness discover elizabeth introduce refer apply native slave intelligence call city read personal weak claimed show member video report black sought wayne drama follow pocahontas current theory donald problem disrespect aim china short truth control earlier disease land actor deliver white apple cheer hide star tribal killer controversy event gotham immune set charlatan taught lie monday arsenal frequent continued famously attack censor alleges opportunist soul fact curriculum studio office intend collaborator historical flower mineral icon tribute education speech frustrate,-0.949,0.8141112618724557,8.064651952461801,0.3450252525252525,0,2023-11-28
NPR,Sean 'Diddy' Combs temporarily steps aside as chairman of Revolt TV network,2023-11-28 14:25:00,Jonathan Franklin,"Combs made the decision to step aside from the media network last week, according to TMZ, which first broke the news of his departure. It's not clear when he plans on returning as chairman. In a statement published by Revolt on Instagram Tuesday morning, the Black music television company said it will continue with its mission of creating ""meaningful content for the culture."" ""Our focus has always been one that reflects our commitment to the collective journey of REVOLT — one that is not driven by any individual, but by the shared efforts and values of our entire team on behalf of advancing, elevating and championing our culture — and that continues,"" the company said. A post shared by REVOLT (@revolttv) News of Combs stepping down from his post comes days after three women came forward to accuse the music mogul of sexual abuse. The lawsuits were filed the week of the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act — a New York law permitting victims of sexual abuse a year-long window to file civil action despite the statute of limitations. One of the lawsuits filed against Combs was a federal suit arguing that the record producer raped, sex trafficked and abused his former girlfriend Cassie. The singer — whose real name is Casandra Ventura — filed the $30 million lawsuit last Thursday, alleging a history of coercion and abuse that went on for more than a decade. According to the lawsuit, Combs and Ventura met when she was 19 years old and Combs was 37. In 2006, Ventura signed a record deal with Combs' label Bad Boy Records. Following the signing of the deal, Combs then settled himself into Ventura's life, as he gained control of all aspects of her life while plying her with drugs and alcohol, the lawsuit alleged. But a day after the pop singer Ventura filed the lawsuit against Combs, the two parties settled the case out of court. Cassie's attorney, Douglas Wigdor, issued a statement about the settlement the following day, saying that Combs and Ventura were both satisfied with the deal they had struck. The statement did not disclose the terms of the agreement. ""I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control. I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support,"" Ventura said in a statement. Ben Brafman, Combs' lawyer, issued a statement on Nov. 18 emphasizing his client's innocence. ""Just so we're clear, a decision to settle a lawsuit, especially in 2023, is in no way an admission of wrongdoing,"" Brafman said. ""Mr. Combs' decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best,"" he added.",2702,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/28/1215600691/sean-diddy-combs-temporarily-quits-chairman-revolt,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,revolttv news casandra company douglas broke post lawsuit network undermine driven disclose sex expiration champion pop survivor adult trafficked chairman party make real sign forward victim year level matter clear act wigdor deal medium settle attorney effort civil york agreement denial happy behalf wish singer signing step life million add entire history statement collective amicably alcohol innocence team resolve satisfied woman file emphasize despite instagram abuse especially label focus meaningful wrongdoing comb plan former boy reflect accord decide continue cassie lawyer mission family court argue statute producer publish sexual share music admission ventura return law black aspect follow claim decade client ply settlement allege coercion journey tuesday struck case morning elevate term brafman decision mogul commitment control week issue value advance revolt individual content suit culture television girlfriend permit thursday departure mutual tmz federal accuse rap day create limitation action unwavering support window record,0.0051499999999999,0.0,7.723507462686566,0.4173494201271978,0,2023-11-28
CNN,"Nicole Kidman’s AMC ad is two years old, and just as beloved (and divisive) as ever",2023-11-28 14:04:00,Scottie Andrew,"Since late 2021, filmgoers who flock to the altar of their local movie theater have borne witness to a kind of gospel: “We come to this place for magic.”“We come to AMC Theaters to laugh, to cry,” to begin our cinematic journey with Nicole Kidman stomping through a puddle in stilettos and a sparkly pantsuit to sit in an empty cinema and marvel at “Jurassic World.”The swelling melodrama of the now-iconic AMC commercial was initially embraced as a campy ode to movie magic and the power of pantsuits,﻿ capably sold by the Oscar-winning Kidman. Then, as people saw it over and over again, the ad became a meme. Audience members started reciting Kidman’s exhilarated monologue along with her, and its popularity jumped off-screen and grew.Kidman and her AMC collaborators have admitted they didn’t expect the performance to be embraced as a campy work of art. Kidman’s husband Keith Urban even said in an interview with podcaster-slash-magician Criss Angel that Kidman was merely doing AMC a solid during “hard times for theaters” during the pandemic.“(We) never in a million years expected it to be this cultural thing,” he said.Now, the AMC spot is entering a new phase of cultural appreciation. It’s still playing two years later, delighting audiences who know the rapturous monologue by heart and mildly irritating those who just want the darn movie to start.For those who appreciate the maudlin absurdity of theatre, the Kidman ad works because it’s a collection of seemingly incongruous parts.There’s Oscar winner Nicole Kidman, dressed to the nines, strutting not onto a red carpet but into her local cineplex. She recites lines like “We go somewhere we’ve never been before — not just entertained, but somehow reborn” with complete integrity while a scene from “Wonder Woman” flashes before her eyes.Not to mention, the ad for AMC almost only plays at AMC, to captive audiences halfway through their popcorn who need no additional persuasion to go to the movies, where they already are.Since its debut in September 2021, when more and more audience members began to return to the theater after the prolonged drought of the early pandemic, people have fallen in love with the odd exultation.Some audience members have been filmed standing throughout the spot and saluting Kidman through the screen. There have been innumerable parodies (including an infamous Lionsgate-produced ad for the most recent “Saw” movie), recreations (“RuPaul’s Drag Race” favorite Katya rocked a pantsuit to her local “Gay-MC Theaters”) and Halloween homages.Some devotees on TikTok even made the pilgrimage to the suburban Los Angeles AMC location where Kidman filmed the ad to retrace her pointy-toed steps. When AMC dared to debut a shortened version of the ad, cutting the line “heartbreak feels good in a place like this,” viewers balked and prompted the company to restore the ad in its full, glorious form.AMC, eager to capitalize on the ad’s infamy, released an extensive line of merchandise printed with excerpts from Kidman’s monologue: There’s a baby onesie with the phrase “We come to AMC Theaters to laugh, to cry, to care,” with the word “cry” cheekily formatted in bold. One shirt even dubs the monologue “The Pledge” and features the entire script on the back so passersby can read it and be moved.In November, AMC announced a collaboration with Loungefly, a company that produces merchandise tailored for all kinds of fandoms. The result is a sparkly pin-striped mini backpack with double-breasted buttons and a little collar – proof that the commercial is now so widely known, it can be reduced to just a silhouette and a suggestion.Two years after it first premiered, the ad is at the point where it will either be run into the ground, or ascend to some higher theatrical plane. Some audiences are souring on its ubiquity, claiming it’s lost its luster after countless parodies, including a “Saturday Night Live” sketch and an appearance in Jimmy Kimmel’s Oscars monologue earlier this year. Since 2022, moviegoers on Reddit have been polling each other on whether the ad is an obnoxious waste of time.Movie theaters, meanwhile, are still struggling to convince audiences to return in large numbers after the pandemic and the streaming boom, though hits like “Barbie” and “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” boosted 2023 summer box office numbers. Theaters are continuing to close, and the SAG-AFTRA strike’s restrictions on actors meant, for a time, Kidman was one of the only celebrities viewers would likely see ahead of a film.But AMC is continuing to bet on the prolific star. Kidman renewed her deal with the company last year, and CEO Adam Aron even called her “The First Lady of AMC.” There’s a second Kidman ad in the works, he told Variety in May, which all but guarantees Kidman will greet audiences for years to come. Love them or hate them, it seems the immortal words of AMC’s pre-show gospel are on their way to movie history.",4938,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/entertainment/nicole-kidman-amc-ad-keith-urban-cec/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point kidman script screen run reddit company version strike meme flock widely campy retrace ceo carpet laugh popularity absurdity pandemic announce race print reborn swift solid persuasion appreciate movie criss make year greet back guarantee feature viewer feel deal result devotee celebrity witness captive lady initially include cinema salute luster melodrama close ground polling reduce drought million power entire dub convince late waste history pledge prompt hit format gospel adam silhouette time woman dare ascend mention halfway recreation admit interview enter plane amc ode cultural strut katya extensive rock start baby rupaul popcorn complete onesie proof continue entertain angeles collar rapturous variety marvel call read wonder keith release love november kimmel magic renew sell claim lose additional darn tailor bet summer swell maudlin stomp location actor shirt sour puddle nicole shorten hate monologue spot eager empty office collaborator collection full scene fall recite cry winner number stream meant passersby seemingly red cut expect mildly high produce husband mini obnoxious night filmgoers restore flash cineplex odd sketch boom heartbreak ahead recites button performance exhilarate fandom hard backpack large place stiletto altar jurassic begin kind sparkly delight parody struggle early borne glorious collaboration immortal audience work step urban art excerpt theatre irritate appearance theater oscar told appreciation aron incongruous commercial film embrace box boost loungefly innumerable live drag bold tour tiktok phase capably moviegoer countless barbie cinematic jumped theatrical angel phrase prolific taylor word saturday pantsuit member return merchandise play suburban cheekily integrity journey restriction prolong earlier local star favorite line dress infamy capitalize pilgrimage september jimmy recent heart debut infamous premier stand halloween balk ubiquity,0.9911,0.1215066828675577,9.04263048016701,0.4026708987529882,0,2023-11-28

CNN,Mark Cuban is leaving ‘Shark Tank’,2023-11-28 12:18:00,Lisa Respers France,"Mark Cuban is swimming away from the show that helped America better come to know the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks.During an appearance on the Showtime podcast “All The Smoke,” Cuban talked to hosts and former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson about his time on the entrepreneur series “Shark Tank.”“This is our 15th year. Next year, 16th year, is going to be my last year,” Cuban said.When Jackson joked that - like an athlete - Cuban is “hanging up the shoes” Cuban responded, “It’s time.”“Shark Tank” features successful business people, or “sharks,” like Cuban who hear pitches from entrepreneurs trying to take their businesses to the next level and looking for the sharks to invest. Cuban said he loves the show “because it sends the message the American dream is alive and well.”“I feel like in doing ‘Shark Tank’ all these years, we’ve trained a generation of entrepreneurs, multiple generations of entrepreneurs that if somebody can come from Iowa or Sacramento or wherever, and show up on the carpet of ‘Shark Tank’ and show their business and get a deal, it’s going to inspire generations of kids,” Cuban said. “That’s what happens, right? Now we’ve got people coming on [saying] I watched you when I was 10 years old.”Cuban said he’s invested in hundreds of companies that were pitched on the show and “on a cash basis I’m down a little bit, but on a mark to market, meaning the companies are still in operation, I’m way up.”CNN has reached out to ABC for comment.",1499,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/entertainment/mark-cuban-leaving-shark-tank/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,billionaire generation athlete hear company host america tank carpet barnes bit shoe american dallas away year level feature dream feel deal comment series matt appearance mark kid time podcast cash swim business hang reach former operation sends cnn nba train message joked shark invest show love sacramento meaning pitch inspire abc smoke iowa basis cuban successful respond showtime player entrepreneur jackson multiple alive owner talk hundred market stephen watch,0.94355,0.0,6.013902439024388,0.2647130647130647,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Opinion: Elon Musk’s Israel tour was transparently transactional and insulting,2023-11-28 11:59:00,not specified,"Elon Musk is trying to make amends, or at least do damage control, after endorsing an antisemitic post on his platform X, formerly Twitter. Musk, however, isn’t actually adequately apologizing or doing much of anything to address his own repeated vile actions or the bigotry that has overtaken X since he took the helm.This week, he paid a visit to Israel, a nation in the midst of a bloody war, to prove, as he put it, that “actions speak louder than words.”Unfortunately for Musk, both his actions and his words are odious.Musk’s latest problem started when an X user addressed antisemites on the platform, posting, “To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting ‘Hitler was right’: You got something you want to say? Why dont (sic) you say it to our faces ….”Another responded: “Okay. Jewish communties (sic) have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I’m deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest s*** now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don’t exactly like them too much.”In response, Musk replied, “You have said the actual truth.”And then he went further, saying that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) “unjustly attacks the majority of the West,“ by calling out antisemitism. Musk claimed: “This is because [the ADL] cannot, by their own tenets, criticize the minority groups who are their primary threat.”Jewish groups quickly pointed out that the statement Musk endorsed as “the actual truth” is actually a version of a racist conspiracy theory. The idea is that Jews are letting immigrant invaders into the country to strip Whites of their power and destroy White culture.And it’s not just some bigots bantering on social media. This ugly “Great Replacement” theory has been behind mass shootings that have targeted specific racial or ethnic groups, including at a grocery store in Buffalo that killed 10 Black shoppers and employees.The backlash to Musk’s comments on X was swift: Advertisers pulled their campaigns from X, and Musk came under international criticism.And so, off to Israel he went, to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, tour a kibbutz that was attacked by Hamas on Oct. 7 and meet some of the family members of the hostages taken by Hamas that day. Musk and Netanyahu had a live conversation on X, during which Musk, referring to Hamas, said, “Those who are intent on murder must be neutralized. Then the propaganda must stop.”He added that Gaza must be made “prosperous,” and “If (all) that happens, I think it will be a good future,” noting that he’d “love to help.”What a joke.Musk’s Israel tour was transparently transactional and frankly insulting. The antisemitic sentiment Musk endorsed had nothing to do with Israel; “replacement theory” is generally an unsupported allegation that Jews and other immigrants in the US and Europe are destroying Western civilization.Meeting with a billionaire on a reputation-saving mission should certainly be pretty low on the list of priorities for Israeli leaders, who, at this particular moment, are still negotiating the return of dozens of Israelis are being held hostage by Hamas, and overseeing a devastating war in Gaza that has killed thousands of innocent civilians and displaced countless more. A chat with Musk and a personal tour of Hamas’ devastation seems like it could have waited.A tour of Israel in the middle of a war doesn’t even come close to solving the root problem of antisemitism — and it shouldn’t absolve Musk of responsibility for his own words and actions.Under Musk’s leadership, X has turned into a swamp of prejudice and bigotry. Known neo-Nazi and white supremacists have had their accounts reinstated. Members of the Islamic State returned to the platform and some QAnon conspiracy theorists have been allowed to pay for verification badges on the site.In the months after Musk’s takeover, hate speech on the site surged: Anti-Black racial slurs tripled, and antisemitic posts increased by 61%, according to a report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Musk’s response? He sued the CCDH.“X is a free public service funded largely by advertisers,” X said in a blog post about the lawsuit. “Through the CCDH’s scare campaign and its ongoing pressure on brands to prevent the public’s access to free expression, the CCDH is actively working to prevent public dialogue.”This month, the progressive watchdog group Media Matters published a report showing that a number of ads were displayed alongside antisemitic and pro-Nazi posts on X. Musk’s response to that report? He sued Media Matters.Earlier this year, the ADL published a report documenting an increase in antisemitic content on X under Musk’s ownership. Musk threatened to sue them, too, blaming the organization for a huge drop in X’s ad sales.Musk has compromised his “free speech absolutism,” not to make significant efforts to ban White supremacists and neo-Nazis, but to prevent terms widely adopted by the pro-Palestinian movement, including “decolonization” and “from the river to the sea,” from being used on X.Many people find these terms deeply offensive when applied to Israel, as they suggest an end to the Jewish state and the likely expulsion of millions of Jews from the region. But it’s pretty rich to ban these words after endorsing antisemitism. And richer still to see a number of opportunists and enablers allow Musk to continue with this farce. Netanyahu is simply the most recent. ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt is another: Even though his own organization documented pervasive antisemitism on X and Musk threatened to sue them for exposing it, Greenblatt nevertheless responded to the “decolonization” and “from the river to the sea” ban by applauding Musk for his “leadership in fighting hate.”Musk has not yet bothered to issue an apology, or take any responsibility whatsoever for his statements or his company’s antisemitism problem. He has, however, found time to post more vile content on X.This is nothing new. Musk has a long history of making bigoted statements, or supporting the bigoted statements of others. He seems to hold a special ire for George Soros, the Hungarian financier and philanthropist who survived Nazi occupation in the 1940s. Soros has become the subject of a great many far-right and antisemitic conspiracy theories. Musk has compared Soros to a Jewish supervillain, and has said he hates humanity and “wants to erode the very fabric of civilization.”After “Dilbert” creator Scott Adams went on a racist rant in which he said Black Americans were a “hate group” who people should “get the hell away” from, Musk defended him, tweeting that the “media is racist.” Later, he added that while Adams’s comments “weren’t good,” they did express an “element of truth.”There’s that word from Musk again: “Truth.” He is proving to us, over and over again, that what he believes to be true is profoundly ugly, bigoted and false. We should listen, and understand that the world’s richest man is saying exactly what he means.",7170,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/opinions/elon-musk-israel-tour-antisemitism-filipovic/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point billionaire unsupported leader express minority company international version dilbert racist listen adl widely post triple lawsuit ceo nation region ethnic decolonization social conspiracy sentiment moment significant gaza displace solve american swift buffalo ongoing make center brand great oversee year insult israel devastate hatred matter digital medium element hungarian chat intent rant turn amends internet greenblatt include reply expose platform close murder quickly site million power civilian late europe history statement shooting fabric western huge adam pull time apology offensive endorse invader bigot adopt theorist erode formerly george occupation netanyahu absolve disturb richest mass bother tenet ban find financier hell start long paid alongside accord dialectical continue apply mission family farce threaten call address actual personal claimed love simply supremacist report middle generally israeli ccdh meet claim replacement islamic tiniest scott richer organization service transparently river truth dozen hamas antisemites issue priority immigrant transactional hate repeat horde drop attack document idea opportunist benjamin realization destroy pay found applaud frankly action false x note musk jewish suggest majority bigoted ugly league speech primary number free specific anonymity responsibility month population blog sic strip subject overtaken bloody racial counter nazi midst pressure louder tweet stop backlash rich future enablers believe ire jonathan away coward verification absolutism country prosperous ownership progressive west badge state compromise effort humanity scare campaign target comment allegation neutralize understand takeover kind vile work grocery slur hitler add innocent jew pervasive conversation elon survive movement damage kibbutz watchdog propaganda hold antisemitism largely philanthropist unjustly whatsoever displayed give put soros exact live minister antisemitic flood tour prime countless creator communties blame supervillain pretty refer actively surge list word twitter world visit deeply publish low public expression special show account member return access black user store hiding bigotry negotiate theory kill criticize qanon problem respond prejudice apologize term unfortunately adequately advertiser control week held white prevent expulsion leadership compare defend group particular thousand response swamp content recent prove hostage disinterested fight increase day shopper devastation bantering support reinstate speak root profoundly push fund,-0.99565,0.2928870292887028,8.767811831789018,0.448403169157886,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Everything you need to know about Beyoncé’s ‘Renaissance’ movie,2023-11-28 11:41:00,Leah Asmelash,"It wasn’t enough for Beyoncé to command stadiums around the world this summer. Queen Bey is now coming to movie theaters.“Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” a documentary about the artist’s record-breaking world tour, will be released Friday, gracing fans with an early Christmas gift.Beyond several trailers promoting the film, little has been said about what to expect. The trailers show Beyoncé on and off stage, juxtaposing her full-glam performance scenes with more everyday clips. In one, she stretches with her 11-year-old daughter Blue Ivy before a show; in another, she is make-up free and talking right to the camera.With the premiere date fast approaching, here’s everything you need to know about what to expect from the movie.Per the official summary of the film, “It is about Beyoncé’s intention, hard work, involvement in every aspect of the production, her creative mind and purpose to create her legacy and master her craft.”Based on what we see in the trailers — shots of Beyoncé performing, rehearsing, etc. — that seems true. In one trailer, she also says: “In this world that is very male-dominated, I’ve had to be really tough to balance motherhood and being on this stage. It just reminds me of who I really am.”Striking that balance may also be a focal point of the film, as fans see how Beyoncé handles life on the road with her family.Officially, the film comes out on Friday, December 1, but some theaters have showings on Thursday evening.Though prices will vary by theater, tickets will go fast; back in October, first day presales for tickets were reportedly estimated to be up to $7 million.Yes, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” came out in October, raking in $96 million in its opening weekend — making it the highest-grossing concert film domestically for an opening weekend, according to AMC.Unlike Beyoncé’s film, the “Eras” movie was filmed over three nights during Swift’s six-night residency at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles back in August, whereas the “Renaissance” film seems to chronicle a larger swath of Beyoncé’s 56-show tour across Europe and North America.Still, the release of the two concert movies mirror each other. Both Swift and Beyoncé chose to distribute their films directly through AMC Theatres, rather than a traditional Hollywood distributor – effectively cutting out the middleman and securing higher paydays for the artists and their teams.No matter what fans may think, the two do not seem to be in competition. Beyoncé made an appearance at Swift’s movie premiere in Los Angeles shortly after wrapping her own tour. And in an Instagram caption, Swift said of Beyoncé: “She’s been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale.”In what may be a coincidence, the films’ runtimes are almost equal, with Swift’s coming in at 2 hours and 49 minutes and Beyoncé’s listed at 2 hours and 48 minutes.Although there’s been no official word from the Queen herself on how moviegoers should dress, Beyoncé did ask concertgoers to wear all silver when attending her “Renaissance” shows, dubbing it her “House of Chrome.”If attending the film on opening weekend, expect most everyone to be dressed like they’re seeing Beyoncé live all over again. So yes, don your best “Alien Superstar” fit, and remember to pee before the show.Despite all the excitement, the “Renaissance” film has also left some fans conflicted.The movie will be shown worldwide, including in Israel. Some fans, angry with Israel over its campaign in Gaza, have called Beyoncé out for not pulling the film from theaters in Israel and not speaking up against the conflict. (The Taylor Swift concert film has also played in Israel in recent weeks.)“I love Beyoncé so much, she’s like one of my favorite artists of all time,” one person said on TikTok. “But her movie being distributed in Israel, I’m sorry — Queen, mother, come on.”Fans also criticized Beyoncé in comments on her Instagram post this week about the latest movie trailer, with some saying they’ll give up their movie tickets if she doesn’t speak out against Israel.Beyoncé has not reacted publicly to fans’ comments.

CNN,How Taylor Swift’s ‘The Eras Tour’ is changing travel,2023-11-28 11:04:00,not specified,"Over the last decade, Taylor Swift has had a transformative effect on the music and entertainment industries. But the megastar, who is currently in the South American leg of her blockbuster The Eras Tour – a multi-continent extravaganza that could end up as the highest-grossing tour of all time – is also drastically shaping the world of travel.It’s difficult to overstate “the Taylor Swift effect,” a term that generally describes the powerful impact of the 33-year-old musician on consumer behavior, on an industry that in many ways is still recalibrating from the effects of the pandemic.Hotels in cities visited by the tour are reporting breaking occupancy records, even at higher rates due to surging demand. Many are also incorporating unique Swift-centric promotions, events and activations to further entice fans. LATAM Airlines waived change fees for passengers following a recently postponed concert; Air New Zealand added 2,000 extra seats to its network around Swift’s shows (and cleverly named some flights NZ1989, a nod to her fifth studio album). And destinations where Swift performs reap such an enormous economic benefit that political leaders like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau practically beg for Swift to tour in their countries.On a more personal level, Swifties – her famously loyal legions of fans – are traveling in new ways to new places for what many call a once-in-lifetime chance to see the performer live on stage.“Quite simply, this is the biggest cultural event around which people are planning travel in a generation,” says Brittany Hodak, a Franklin, Tennessee-based customer experience expert and author of “Creating Superfans: How to Turn Your Customers Into Lifelong Advocates.”“And, unlike a sporting event like the FIFA World Cup or the Olympics that’s concentrated in a few geographic locations, The Eras Tour is boosting travel and tourism across the globe. It’s no wonder we’ve seen world leaders openly campaign for tour stops within their countries.”The tourism impact of Swift’s The Eras Tour has been nothing short of staggering, with the economic boost generated in certain US cities eclipsing the entire GDP of some small countries. Lighthouse (formerly OTA Insights), a Denver-based provider of data for the travel and hospitality industry, describes Eras as “a hospitality phenomenon” in a study it published in August.One often-cited statistic is the whopping $5 billion that Swifties collectively spent across the United States in connection with The Eras Tour. However, the U.S. Travel Association says a more accurate figure is $10 billion or more in total economic impact.In addition, STR, which provides data and analytics around the global hospitality industry, estimated that hotels pulled in $208 million in revenue following Swift’s US shows over the summer, also noting that figure was “conservative” because it accounted only for Swift’s 53 concert nights, not extended fan stays and other factors.Some destinations that have benefited from such a massive windfall are eagerly sharing the results. In Pittsburgh, Swift’s concerts on June 16 and 17 generated $46 million in direct spending, with 83% of attendees coming from outside the county, according to a news release from Visit Pittsburgh. The city’s hotel occupancy, meanwhile, averaged 95% — the highest since the pandemic and the second-highest weekend occupancy on record­­.Not surprisingly, such outsized demand has also resulted in higher consumer prices. Aggregating data from 13 tour stops in North America, Lighthouse found an average bump of 7.7% for hotel room prices the month prior to Swift’s tour compared to the same month in the previous year, and prices 7.2% higher during the month of the tour.“The fact that a single music tour can significantly influence average pricing in major U.S. cities for an entire month underscores the magnitude of this tour and its far-reaching implications for the hotel industry,” the study states.RateGain, a global provider of travel and hospitality data, also noted a “long-tail effect” on tour destinations as travelers create what it and others have coined “Swift-cations.”“Her concerts have brought so much noise that in addition to her being the center of attention, the destination is becoming the center of attention,” Peter Strebel, president of RateGain’s Americas region, tells CNN Travel.As an example, Strebel points to Buenos Aires, where Swift performed the first three shows of her South American tour – and described it as “the best decision possible” on social media platform X. Hotel bookings in the Argentine capital are still “soaring,” even after the concert dates, according to RateGain data. Strebel also notes that if the trend follows, Buenos Aires may be on par to break all its hotel occupancy records in the coming weeks.It’s a murkier picture for the Eras’ next stop, Rio de Janeiro, where recent headlines around Swift’s concerts have hit a rare somber note following the death of a fan, the cause of which has been attributed to extreme heat in the stadium where Swift performed. The pop star postponed her next show just hours beforehand, saying the heat was unsafe, a move that received some criticism from disappointed fans who had already arrived.However, from a tourism perspective, Swift’s Rio appearances started off on a bejeweled note. The 12-time Grammy winner received a warm welcome to the popular coastal city via its world-famous Christ the Redeemer statue, which sported a projection that made the landmark look like it was wearing a T-shirt inspired by the one Swift wore in her “You Belong With Me” music video. It was also decorated with symbols from her songs and the names of Brazilian states.In her first Rio show, Swift told the sold-out crowd it was “sort of the nicest thing anyone’s ever done for me” as her fans screamed and applauded.Beyond enjoying record occupancy levels thanks to Eras tour stops – especially following several downturn years during the pandemic – many hotels have gone a step further to create an unforgettable fan experience.Loews Hotels, for one, created bespoke pre-concert events at several properties, including Atlanta and Nashville, complete with Swift-inspired cocktails, playlists and backdrops for social media photos. Loews Arlington also hosted the popular “13: A Taylor Swift Fan Podcast” as part of a sold-out pre-concert party featuring themed cocktails and bracelet-making, a spokesperson for Loews Hotels & Co told CNN Travel via email.Even without a concert date in their city, some hotels have capitalized on Swift’s mega fandom alone to fill special events – like the Eras-themed, pop-up candle-making classes at Conrad New York Downtown, a luxury, all-suite property near the World Trade Center. Hosted in collaboration with The Candle Garden, the class has been popular among hotel guests (though non-guests also are welcome), says The Candle Garden owner Jordan Reemsnyder, who notes that a father-daughter duo from Iceland has pre-booked for an upcoming class.Swifties are also taking to the seas. In October 2024, a four-night, Swift-themed cruise is scheduled to set sail from the Port of Miami on October 21, 2024, the day after Swift performs her last show in the city.Beyond North and South America, a lavender haze has apparently already settled on destinations where The Eras Tour is headed. In Europe and the UK, where Swift has 50 concerts in the spring and summer of 2024, there are already indications of strong demand, according to Lighthouse data. Amsterdam, which is set to host three concerts in July, is seeing an uptick in hotel searches, with concert weekend rates marked up by about 160 euros ($175) compared to the week prior; prices in Dublin, which hosts a trio of shows the week beforehand, reflect rate increases of about 100 euros ($110).For Contiki, which bills itself as a social travel company for ages 18-35, the European leg for Swift’s The Eras Tour presented an opportunity it knew it had to take advantage of.During the first North American leg, the London-based operator began brainstorming ideas, and in September 2023 launched its catchy “Taylor Your Itinerary in 2024” offer: five trips tied to Eras concert dates in four European cities, featuring Swift-inspired itineraries and other fun extras. Contiki also added a 13% off discount – a nod to a number Swift claims is lucky for her — on those trips and all other European summer itineraries longer than 14 days.“[Swift is] the most talked about amongst our communities as an artist,” says Lottie Norman, chief marketing officer for Contiki. “She’s been riding this wave for a year. So the alignment for us was just huge, and we knew we had to do something.”Some Swifties are planning trips of their own to see the popstar on as many stages as possible. Stephanie DePrez, a stand-up comedian and opera singer who lives in Berlin, joined forces with a friend and fellow fan in London to try to secure presale ticket codes in “basically every European city as soon as it was announced,” she tells CNN Travel.Strategizing with various country-specific virtual private networks, DePrez and her friend succeeded in snagging those crucial codes. But the process wasn’t without a few minor hiccups. DePrez’s friend was able to get four tickets – in Paris, not London, however – while DePrez discovered she’d be heading to Warsaw, Poland, by herself, which was not by design.“I had no idea because everything was in Polish,” she tells CNN Travel of the ticket purchasing platform. “I thought I was paying in euros, but I was paying in [Polish] zloty, and I was paying this ginormous amount of money. I was like, well, that’s obviously four tickets. Nope, one ticket.”DePrez says initially the mistake was “devastating,” but she has since come around to the idea of a solo adventure in Warsaw, a city she’s never been to. She’s also excited about attending that Paris show with her Swiftie friends, and says any inconveniences with ticketing thus far or her trips this summer will be eclipsed by being in the same venue as an entertainer she’s been deeply “invested in” for years.“When Taylor is onstage, and I am in the audience, there is a reverence for that relationship that I don’t think is normal for pop stars,” DePrez says. “That relationship she has with her fans is so intentional. It’s worth traveling for.”As hospitality and brand experts note, destinations and tourism organizations poised to make the most out of these once-in-an-Era opportunities are those that strategically align with Swift’s brand and values. Just as importantly, they must resonate with those scores of loyal Swifties, as Marcus Collins, marketing professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and a former social media strategist for Beyoncé, points out.Citing Royal Caribbean’s Swift-inspired cruise, Collins told CNN Travel via email, “There’s a lot of room to do something even more thematic that could potentially be more meaningful to Swifties who understand all the nuances of her.”Such intense fandom has come as a surprise to even the most seasoned hospitality industry insiders. “Her fan base’s dedication is something I’ve never seen before,” Stephen Borecki, general manager of Fairfield Inn & Suites New Orleans Downtown/French Quarter, tells CNN Travel via email.Borecki says as soon as dates were announced for the Eras’ final North America leg, which includes three late October shows in New Orleans, the property received “dozens of phone calls and emails” daily about room availability. In addition, the hotel projects that Swift’s three concert days will produce 150% more revenue than the 2025 Super Bowl to be hosted in New Orleans.Said Borecki: “I don’t know of another person or event that I will ever see that draws this much demand.”From a destination marketing perspective, one potential missed opportunity came early in the tour, during its March 17, 2023 kickoff in Glendale, Arizona. To mark the occasion, the City of Glendale renamed itself “Swift City” during the three-day stretch of concerts. But some media insiders and social media commenters noted the lackluster proclamation ceremony by Glendale Mayor Jerry Weiers, as well as the missed chance to incorporate a clever play on words with a term like “Eras-ona.”Even so, the city managed to shake it off and pulled in impressive tourism numbers: a 50% increase in its average daily rate for hotels compared to the previous year, as well as nearly 99% occupancy rate during show dates, a city spokesperson told CNN Travel via email.No doubt that as The Eras Tour continues to break records, savvy hospitality and tourism organizations aiming to capitalize on the events headed their way are taking careful notes. But, according to Hodak, the fan experience expert, they should also act fast.“This is not going to be a trend – there won’t be a tour equivalent to The Eras Tour for a very, very long time, perhaps not until Taylor is on tour again,” Hodak says. “This has been the perfect storm of so many things happening: Taylor having several albums to promote and tour simultaneously, a hunger for live shows coming out of Covid, and of course Taylor being one of the biggest stars and smartest marketers on the planet.“It’s lightning in a bottle, and … brands need to be making their moves now.”",13349,https://www.cnn.com/travel/taylor-swift-effect-travel-industry/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and

CNN,Matthew Perry’s family would like you to donate to his foundation for Giving Tuesday,2023-11-28 10:34:00,Lisa Respers France,"Matthew Perry’s family is seeking help in honoring his legacy.A foundation in Perry’s name was launched earlier this month, following the death of the “Friends” star at the age of 54 in October.Ahead of Giving Tuesday, which is a global movement designed to encourage donations to nonprofits, Perry’s family released a statement to People.“It is important to us, as a family, to honor Matthew’s legacy,” the statement reads. “The potential that the Matthew Perry Foundation has to help those suffering from this disease is something we are proud to bring to the world.”His stepfather, journalist Keith Morrison, who is known for his work on “Dateline,” posted an appeal on social media Monday.“This is not the sort of thing I commonly do, this pitch. But this year is different,” he wrote on X. “And tomorrow is Giving Tuesday. Do what you can; he would have been grateful. matthewperryfoundation.org.”“The Matthew Perry Foundation is the realization of Matthew’s enduring commitment to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction,” the website for the organization states. “It will honor his legacy and be guided by his own words and experiences and driven by his passion for making a difference in as many lives as possible.”The front page of the site also includes quotes from Perry.“When I die, I don’t want ‘Friends’ to be the first thing that’s mentioned – I want helping others to be the first thing that’s mentioned. And I’m going to live the rest of my life proving that,” the quotes read. “Addiction is far too powerful for anyone to defeat alone.

CNN,Elon Musk wants to be a world leader. His own behavior is holding him back,2023-11-28 09:50:00,Brian Fung,"Elon Musk is an increasingly important player in global affairs and has been touring the world to meet with political leaders in recent months. But his statements, social media posts and actions prove he is fundamentally unprepared for world leadership, even as he has amassed control over ever more levers of power through his ownership of X, Starlink and other technology platforms.Days after publicly embracing an antisemitic conspiracy theory favored by White supremacists, Musk is again having to make amends after visiting Israel and meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and professing his support for Israel’s destruction of Hamas.It’s not the first time Musk has had to mend fences after being confronted about antisemitism on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. As recently as September, while feuding with the Anti-Defamation League over his attacks against George Soros and amid a broader rise of anti-Jewish hate speech on X, Musk clarified to Netanyahu in a separate conversation: “Obviously, I’m against antisemitism.”Musk’s flirtation with themes of Jewish hatred has been a focus of intense public scrutiny, and he has repeatedly tried to shut down allegations of antisemitism. But his own words keep the criticism alive. His inability to shake those associations reflect a deeper and even more significant struggle between Musk’s two halves: The side of him that’s desperate to be understood as a serious, influential world leader; and the side of him that’s mired in an echo chamber of online extremism, one that is increasingly of his own making.On Monday, Musk summed up his takeaways for Netanyahu this way: “Those who are intent to murder must be neutralized; then the propaganda must stop that is training people to be murderers in the future; and then making Gaza prosperous. If that happens, I think it’ll be a good future…. I’d love to help.”But he had not acknowledged what landed him in this position in the first place: his endorsement of the antisemitic claim that Jews want to replace Whites in Western countries with non-White minorities, a statement that has been broadly condemned by the White House and other leaders around the globe.The more Musk elevates misinformation and conspiracy theories, the less equipped he becomes to deal in matters of state — and the more vulnerable he is to manipulation by authoritarians and unscrupulous actors who would seek to use his influence for their own ends.By welcoming and finding comfort in the presence of others with extreme views, Musk risks falling into a similar trap that has ensnared countless individuals and families and that has previously been exploited by disinformation actors, according to Matthew Facciani, a misinformation and media literacy researcher at The University of Notre Dame.“We can observe Elon Musk’s Twitter/X activity that he regularly consumes right-wing content and this increased during COVID-19,” Facciani said in an email. “So Musk residing within an information bubble that skews his perception of a political group is no different than many other people who spend too much time within their own social media bubbles.”“The big difference,” Facciani said, “is that he has billions of dollars and immense influence on the world.”For years, Musk has fancied himself as a mover and shaker on the world stage.His early, grandiose pronouncements about making humanity an interplanetary species were some of the first indications of his perceived self-importance. More recently, however, Musk’s ambitions have come a bit closer to Earth and become far more concrete. Not only has he become a major vendor for government contracts, but he has also been more willing to insert himself into culture wars, or even into actual wars, as in the case of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.From unveiling a widely mocked “peace plan” for the two sides to suggesting a settlement of Ukraine’s future by means of a proposed fistfight with Russian President Vladimir Putin to effectively blocking Starlink service in Crimea, Musk has repeatedly angled for a key position in a geopolitical conflict he appears not to fully understand.Elsewhere, Musk has staked out his own leadership role in the global policy debate over artificial intelligence, appearing with other tech luminaries in an exclusive US Senate event in Washington in September and sitting down with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in November.In September, Musk also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose regime he accommodated in May by blocking hundreds of X accounts a day before this year’s parliamentary and presidential elections.And he’s tried to play kingmaker in US politics as well, launching Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign on X and promoting the vaccine skeptic Robert Kennedy Jr.’s own long-shot White House bid.On Monday, after touring one of the sites hit by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks, Musk rolled out a sober diagnosis of the Israel conflict.“One can generally agree that we want a good future for Palestinians,” Musk told Netanyahu. “The challenge is really, how do you get rid of the ones who are hell-bent on murdering Jewish people while minimizing civilian casualties and ultimately stopping the sort of propaganda that is convincing people to engage in murder?”Musk’s recent eagerness to leap into the biggest geopolitical events of the day speaks to the influential role he plays in the future of society: He is paving the road to the future with his rockets, satellite network, leadership in electric cars and control of one of the world’s most consequential social networks. His access to resources, his proximity to people who wield actual power and his apparent chronic need for attention and acceptance have all combined to propel him to the center of the world stage — no matter his qualifications.Musk may desire influence over global affairs commensurate with that of a top-tier statesman. But his growing association with internet extremism puts him out of step with the kind of world leader he imagines himself to be.By and large, the international community and the elites who operate in that space — and whose ranks Musk clearly wishes to join — do not subscribe to the edgelord toxicity of the virtual mudpits Musk inhabits online. These are the echo chambers, of which X is increasingly one, that reinforce Musk’s more reactionary, extremist tendencies, the sorts of views that if a country expressed them might help it inch closer toward pariah status.There are many world leaders who hold extreme or far-right views, of course. But Musk does not present himself as one of these people; instead, he proclaims to defend democratic values traditionally associated with mainstream liberal democracies, including freedom of speech and individual liberty. The image he presents is that of a champion of the post-World War II international order, which is partly why it is so jarring when he casually riffs on antisemitic, transphobic, homophobic, xenophobic and other hate-filled tropes with paying subscribers of X. It just isn’t done by any serious world leader, not even the ones the United States considers its adversaries.Nor has a majority of the world community attempted to both-sides Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or tacitly condoned Russia’s annexation of Crimea, as Musk appeared to do with a Starlink policy restricting satellite internet coverage over that region (in a move that ultimately disrupted a Ukrainian attack on Russian naval forces last year). Musk claimed that had Starlink facilitated the Ukrainian attack, the communications service would have been “complicit in a major act of war,” and Musk biographer Walter Isaacson has said the billionaire feared the possibility of Russian retaliation with nuclear weapons. But Starlink had already been serving Ukrainian forces elsewhere within the country’s borders; Musk’s stance on Crimea, which does not seem to recognize the region as a part of Ukraine, is fundamentally at odds with a broad international consensus that Russia seized the territory illegally in 2014. (On Monday, Musk made what appeared to be another Starlink decision with geopolitical ramifications by giving the Israeli government control over who could access his satellite internet network in Israel and Gaza; weeks earlier, Musk had vowed that Starlink would “support connectivity to internationally recognized aid organizations” with no mention of preconditions.)Musk’s outbursts that contradict widely held international norms and values are meant for a specific internet audience that Musk mistakes for being representative of the wider world.“Social media provides an easy way to find a community of like-minded people. This can be great for building community within many different groups, but it also means we can find support among more politically extreme groups as well,” said Facciani.Put differently, the constant whiplash that arises whenever Musk makes a provocative remark and then walks it back is the direct result of his fringe internet reality colliding with the real world, over and over.So long as Musk swims in a sea of transgressive reactionism, his attempts to take on the mantle of serious statesman will forever be regarded as unserious at best and dangerous at worst.This story has been updated with additional context.",9334,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/tech/elon-musks-foreign-affairs-netanyahu-antisemitism/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,equip story forever billionaire manipulation leader express international fence rishi fistfight liberty social conspiracy considers significant peace ukrainian politics elevates florida insert important difference roll homophobic back deal medium result broader context angle desantis reactionary intent amends jarring observe ukraine pronouncement affair stance extreme conflict murder electric recently understood presence ultimately government influence statement serve ambition russian closer time odds george formerly focus netanyahu propose partly xenophobic extremist plan skeptic democratic shaker differently long big provide outburst contract murderer fully community reside eagerness previously move extremism subscriber toxicity meet associate feud society claim easy direct additional vowed organization recognize tayyip welcome actor pave bubble event hate putin attack crimea inch pay apparent mistake musk suggest challenge majority league speech university tech scrutiny meant email riff vaccine desire billion proximity shake whiplash seek champion republican stop unscrupulous policy unprepared prosperous ownership skews present large campaign allegation block sort border early training complicit disrupt house operate democracy retaliation building told accommodate propaganda sunak antisemitism confront online give soros kingmaker spend minister weapon antisemitic traditionally attention remark prime destruction countless risk inability statesman intense exploit theme twitter senate visit reality account different pariah car play theory ensnare reactionism player control earlier combine white territory value uk edgelord join defend group engage alive september acceptance indication consensus content chronic culture prove connectivity position inhabits arises hundred precondition support dangerous liberal stage minority information activity speaks widely nuclear image post proclaims palestinian region artificial acknowledge imago separate facilitate regularly turkish technology promote bit casualty gaza echo united flirtation increasingly role sober make rise condemn center real disinformation ron amass endorsement great year israel hatred matter act freedom naval geopolitical fear researcher mover tendency rocket takeaway part resource internet order include earth tacitly transgressive wish exclusive platform political mudpits clarify site immense power regard civilian politically virtual hit luminary amid western kennedy consequential provocative walk update mention road seize comfort wider shut course find invasion reflect vulnerable accord illegally rid family erdogan possibility intelligence grandiose mantle side actual claimed love supremacist casually ramification generally israeli isaacson propel perception service subscribe minimize decision land mire hamas influential unserious diagnosis perceive monday meeting walter association benjamin wield concrete action view x jewish fall space reinforce chamber satellite specific collide month starlink broad instead network unveil profess fancy attempt robert coverage future replace launch country annexation similar parliamentary force misinformation contradict state debate place humanity neutralize broadly fundamentally vendor repeatedly president kind trope global struggle washington audience step convincing sum jew conversation communication elon biographer publicly embrace hold transphobic desperate condone swim matthew agree put interplanetary tour facciani rank aid authoritarian criticism half word world major public regime specie access representative mend norm settlement effectively case leap grow russia week held favor consumes restrict leadership mocked constant individual mainstream recent key vladimir trap increase deeper literacy day lever stake gov elite recep commensurate internationally fringe dollar presidential,-0.0196,0.2892650524962502,11.588911605532168,0.4232009996398487,0,2023-11-28

CNN,Disputed Ukrainian treasures returned to Kyiv after Dutch court ruling,2023-11-28 07:17:00,Lianne Kolirin,"A haul of Ukrainian treasures sent to Europe for an exhibition nearly 10 years ago have been returned to Kyiv from the Netherlands after a lengthy legal battle.The collection of ancient artifacts was dispatched to the Netherlands from four museums in Crimea before Russia’s annexation of the region in 2014. But the annexation meant their return has not been straightforward.“After almost 10 years of litigation, artifacts from four Crimean museums that were presented at the exhibition ‘Crimea: Gold and Secrets of the Black Sea’ in Amsterdam have returned to Ukraine,” the National Museum of History of Ukraine said in a statement.The collection comprised 565 items, including antique sculptures, Scythian and Sarmatian jewelry, and Chinese lacquer boxes that are 2,000 years old, the museum said.Rostyslav Karandieiev, Ukraine’s acting minister of culture and information policy, described the treasures’ homecoming as “our great historical victory.”“It is very important for us to save and protect our history, traditions, and heritage. This is what we are fighting for at the battlefield. We are fighting for our identity and freedom,” he told CNN.“The exhibition in the Netherlands was showing the history of Ukrainian Crimea, therefore it is exclusively the people of Ukraine who should possess these treasures,” he added.In a statement published on its website, the Allard Pierson museum in Amsterdam confirmed that the collection had been kept in storage while the legal dispute raged on over whether items should be returned to Ukraine or the four museums in Russian-controlled Crimea, with both sides claiming ownership rights over the historic pieces.Ultimately, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ruled on June 9 of this year that the collection should be returned to Kyiv.In its statement, the Allard Pierson museum went on to say that the items were “independently checked and carefully packed in accordance with museum rules” last month and arrived back in Kyiv on Sunday.Els van der Plas, director of the museum, said in the statement: “This was a special case, in which cultural heritage became a victim of geopolitical developments. After it became clear in 2014 that the judge would consider the case, we focused on safely storing the artefacts until the time came to return them to their rightful owner. We are pleased that clarity has emerged and that they have now been returned.”Welcoming the development, Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture and Information Policy said in a statement: “Until the de-occupation of Crimea, the ‘Scythian Gold’ will be temporarily stored on the territory of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra.”",2634,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/style/ukraine-treasures-returned-intl-scli/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,jewelry meant rule month rag information homecoming exclusively accordance judge region lavra item emerge independently ukrainian dispute chinese victim policy important great year annexation sarmatian ownership arrive clear back act present carefully freedom allard geopolitical comprise ministry crimean packed include sculpture ukraine protect heritage museum national june supreme development europe history ago statement director told antique karandieiev artefact pierson gold exhibition time box scythian minister focus temporarily tradition website cultural battlefield consider court publish litigation side pleased special show rightful checked safely return black lacquer store posse secret claim treasure described save case clarity identity lengthy russia welcome legal dispatch territory kyiv netherlands historic culture plas crimea ancient confirm storage owner fight amsterdam haul collection historical artifact,0.9811,0.2277904328018223,11.45928118393234,0.3632505175983436,0,2023-11-28
CNN,"It’s holiday season. For some, it will mean pink slips",2023-11-28 06:00:00,Jeanne Sahadi,"Layoffs are never welcome news to employees. But they bring an extra bite when they are carried out during the holiday season.Even if they are just signaled as coming in the next few months, the mere concern that you could be let go puts a real damper on plans to enjoy (and spend money on) family and festivities between Thanksgiving and the New Year.In November alone, Citigroup, Charles Schwab, Vice Media, car parts maker Continental and shipping giant Maersk were among well-known employers that announced job cuts.And more companies may make similar announcements by year-end.“We’ve seen an increase in layoffs. We are really busy right now and expect to stay that way through the end of the year,” said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm that employers hire to help their laid-off employees find new work.The good news is that Challenger said he is not anticipating a wave of big, panic layoffs in any industry like those that took place in 2020 in sectors hard hit by the pandemic. As in most years, layoffs will be specific to individual employers’ circumstances.The other piece of good news is that the US labor market is still tight, with 1.5 job openings registered in October for every unemployed person.Still, depending on your position, age and pay grade, it may take you longer than you’d like to land a comparable role.So, now may be a good time to game out a plan for how to protect yourself mentally and financially if that were to happen.Remember that you usually can’t reduce your chances of being laid off. That’s because in most instances the rationale for job cuts is far beyond your control. The most typical reasons cited for layoffs are overhiring, automation, business downturns and mergers, according to Randstad RiseSmart, a career coaching and career transition solutions firm.That said, under the so-called federal WARN Act, companies with 100 or more employees that are planning a mass layoff, which is very specifically defined here, must provide staff with at least 60 days’ notice. Some states have more stringent rules under mini-WARN laws, requiring employers to give more notice (typically 90 days), even if they have fewer than 100 employees.Should a company fail to provide the minimum required notice — meaning you’re let go without warning and without cause — they must provide you with pay and benefits for the warning period.While WARN Act payments are not considered severance, let’s be real: It’s money that will help you pay your bills while you look for another job. And some employees may also receive severance on top of that.US employers are under no legal requirement to provide severance unless you are under a contract that provides for it.That said, while not legally obligated, many large employers do choose to provide severance when they lay people off, if only for goodwill purposes and to protect themselves from legal claims you might make against them. (Also worth noting: Earlier this year, the National Labor Relations Board restricted the scope of what rights an employer may ask you to forfeit in exchange for severance.)The average payout for individual contributors (i.e., non-executives), according to Challenger, is two weeks of pay for every year of service at the employer.That’s based on an analysis of more than 850 severance plans offered last year by its clients, where the average individual contributor’s tenure was seven years. That coverage typically included health care benefits during the severance period, plus outplacement services.Breaking Challenger’s numbers down further, more than a third (35%) of the employees got between one and nine weeks, while half received between 10 and 24 weeks.Another 12% got between 25 and 51 weeks. And only 2% got 52 weeks, while 0.6% got between 54 and 99 weeks.Since layoffs are a feature, not a bug, in corporate life, planning now for ﻿any transition period between jobs can alleviate some of your concerns.Check your employer’s severance policy: See if your employer has posted its severance policy on the company’s internal site. If it has, calculate how much you may receive based on your tenure and whether your employer will continue to subsidize your health insurance during the severance period.Do this at least once a year, since an employer may choose to alter its severance policy, for better or worse, at any point.Ballpark your expenses: Estimate how much you spend on essentials every month (food, housing, utilities, etc.). Then think about all the non-essentials you spend money on but which you can cut if need be. You want to develop what financial educator Tiffany Aliche, aka “The Budgetnista,” calls your temporary “noodle budget” — which is simply the bare minimum amount you have to spend in a lean month.Don’t forget to consider health costs in the essentials category. If your employer won’t continue subsidizing your health plan expenses, and you stay on your employer’s plan through COBRA, legally you may be charged up to 102% of the cost of your plan. That’s a big jump from the average that employees pay today for workplace health coverage: 28% of the total cost for family coverage and 17% for single coverage. The employer usually picks up the rest.Assess how much you’ll need and the resources available to you: Even if you get severance, it may not last for the entire time it takes you to find a job that pays what you earn now.“Break down what you’ll need to cover,” said Aliche, author of “Made Whole: The Practical Guide to Reaching Your Financial Goals.”For example, you may expect three months’ worth of severance, but realistically it may take you six months to get a comparable job.Covering yourself financially is like making a stew and figuring out how much of each ingredient you have and how much you need, Aliche said. In this case, the ingredients are severance, unemployment benefits, emergency savings and income you can generate from a side hustle.Go to your state’s labor department site to learn what the rules are for collecting unemployment: when you can apply, how much you’d be paid and when you can expect to receive your first check after losing your job.Next, figure out how much you’ll have in emergency savings to tide you over if severance and unemployment aren’t sufficient to cover your needs. Ideally, you’d have three to six months’ worth of your salary, said certified financial planner Ann Minnium. If you hold a very senior role, and especially if you’re the sole breadwinner in your household, you might want to have up to a year’s worth of pay.Since many people find those emergency savings thresholds too difficult to reach, think about the skill sets you have that you can monetize while you look for another job, Aliche said.

CNN,TikTok owner ByteDance is retreating from gaming and laying off hundreds,2023-11-28 05:02:00,Michelle Toh,"ByteDance, the Chinese tech giant behind TikTok, is pulling back from video gaming in a shift that will result in hundreds of job cuts.The Beijing-based company will wind down Nuverse, the unit that houses its video game studios, next month in an attempt to focus on its core businesses, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.The announcement was made internally on Monday, the source added, requesting anonymity because the details were not public. Nuverse will still retain some operations, including staff that will focus on exploratory initiatives, they added, without specifying how many.But the company will stop development on games that have not yet been released, and will try to sell off existing titles, including “Crystal of Atlan,” an anime-style multiplayer game, and “Earth: Revival,” a sci-fi survival quest, the person said. Both titles were launched earlier this year.ByteDance is also seeking a buyer for Moonton, a video game studio it bought in 2021 that is best known for hit mobile game “Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,” which allows players to battle in an online arena.Such a sale would be significant. The title — which is billed as having racked up more than 1 billion installations and more than 100 million monthly active users — is Nuverse’s biggest game, according to Niko Partners, a market research firm that specializes in video games and esports.In a statement Tuesday, a ByteDance spokesperson confirmed that “following a recent review, we’ve made the difficult decision to restructure our gaming business.”“We regularly review our businesses and make adjustments to center on long-term strategic growth areas,” the representative said in a statement, without elaborating further.The retreat comes as ByteDance is looking to streamline its wider operations, including a recent downsizing of its virtual reality unit, Pico, the source told CNN.Many other Big Tech firms have also been forced to cut staff around the world this year in response to global economic uncertainty following the pandemic.In the case of ByteDance, the company had “invested a lot in the game business but not had big success,” noted Lisa Hanson, CEO of Niko Partners.“It takes a huge amount of investment to produce [blockbuster] titles,” she noted. “That might not be where ByteDance wants to invest right now.”The broader industry is also facing challenges, according to Neil Barbour, research analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.“Mobile gaming revenue is in decline while user acquisition costs are rising,” he told CNN.“So some publishers are taking this moment to reassess big bets placed around the industry and are concluding that a worthwhile payoff may take longer than expected or be completely out of reach.”ByteDance jumped into the gaming space in 2019. Since then, it has failed to make significant inroads against industry leaders Tencent and NetEase.“Tencent and NetEase make up more than half of China’s games market, and Nuverse is nowhere near that,” Hanson told CNN.She suggested ByteDance was simply looking to cut its losses, particularly since gaming still made up just a tiny sliver of its business. Overall, the Nuverse arm is estimated to account for “about 1% or less” of total revenue, said Hanson.“[Even] if ByteDance exits game development and publishing, it will not dramatically impact their own business,” she added.China is the world’s biggest mobile and PC gaming market, according to Niko Partners.The firm projects that the country’s total number of gamers would reach 710.3 million this year, while the industry would take in about $47.7 billion in revenue for video game software and services.",3649,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/tech/bytedance-layoffs-video-gaming-intl-hnk/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,partner leader company mobile ceo source project adjustment growth exploratory regularly moment loss significant review chinese worthwhile make center rise year initiative matter back retain niko dramatically installation result specify legend software broader industry inroad active analyst include earth firm battle million development request virtual announcement tiny statement hit familiar bytedance reassess huge tencent moonton pull detail pico economic specializes revival focus spokesperson wider game estimate operation core downsize restructure big accord release invest simply neil impact bang sell bet atlan service china decision particularly crystal internally netease exit wind monday shift hanson revenue studio sliver note challenge suggest market space number tech anonymity survival month longer billion cut expect arm produce seek difficult attempt cost stop p barbour launch country force bill place pc streamline person global publisher publishing lisa add conclude job house told research blockbuster online unit retreat business elaborate buyer tiktok reach multiplayer exist jumped fail total half world amount investment public nuverse decline reality giant uncertainty video payoff representative account user follow lot tuesday bought case success player earlier completely strategic response recent title rack confirm quest area gamers staff hundred monthly acquisition,0.0918499999999999,0.0822143052891203,10.485,0.3707705318361055,0,2023-11-28
CNN,First lady Jill Biden unveils White House holiday decorations,2023-11-28 00:15:00,Christy Choi,"Complete with 98 Christmas trees, 72 wreaths and 2.8 miles of ribbon, the White House has been transformed into a classic winter wonderland for the holidays.Letters to Santa Claus appear to fly magically in and out of old mailboxes and a vintage train weaves around the base of an 18.5-foot Fraser fir Christmas tree, while all manner of candied treats deck the halls — including a huge gingerbread White House.Unveiling the decorations Monday, first lady Jill Biden said this year’s theme, the “Magic, Wonder and Joy” of the holiday season, was inspired by “childlike marvel and awe.”“Children are unbound by time and inherently know beauty: the rich, colorful mosaic of autumn leaves piled high on an emerald blanket of grass; the mesmerizing rhythm of soft, powdery snow as it falls from a glistening night sky,” said Biden as she welcomed National Guard and local military families to the White House as the first guests to experience the holiday décor.“The holidays offer a time for reflection and a break from our hurried lives, a season to be fully present with our friends and our families. It’s also a season of gratitude,” she added.“Because, you know, children have something to teach us if we’re wise enough to listen: how to remain present, even as a busy world beckons us; how to open ourselves up to love and wonder and to marvel at every moment, no matter how ordinary; how to find beauty at a Metro stop.”Each room, she said, is designed to capture children’s “pure, unfiltered delight and imagination.”The decorations, which also included 33,892 ornaments and 142,425 holiday lights, were installed over a week, with the help of more than 300 volunteers.The White House expects some 100,000 people to visit during the holiday season.Earlier this year, the White House Historical Association unveiled the design of this year’s official Christmas ornament — a holiday wreath adorned with cherubs, dolls, doves, stars, flowers, gingerbread men and more — that was inspired by handcrafted decorations used during the administration of America’s 38th president, Gerald Ford.Previous years’ ornaments have included a fire truck, a steam train and even a helicopter. The decorations are not only meant to brighten people’s homes but are also intended to shine a light on lesser-known stories from America’s past.",2323,https://www.cnn.com/style/jill-biden-white-house-holiday-decorations/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,meant story helicopter gingerbread classic listen america expect ribbon guest manner fraser fly high shine night pile moment administration busy teach instal autumn rich hurry wise ornament year reflection unbound transform military beckons matter present holiday weave biden president lady christmas grass include gratitude delight truck offer season national base mailbox life wreath official house design blanket inherently guard claus steam huge remain time adorn mosaic doll child sky experience home friend joy childlike santa cherub powdery find room beauty train jill complete unveiled handcraft family theme world marvel rhythm leaf fully visit candy wonder tree decoration brighten love light mile glisten ordinary magic inspire past soft mesmerize treat welcome week white local gerald star capture magically monday vintage association fire wonderland snow intend emerald hall open pure historical flower deck fall metro winter unfiltered break colorful,0.9881,0.0,9.4304,0.4216666666666667,0,2023-11-28
CNN,Major brands are not only pausing ads on Elon Musk’s X. They’re stepping away from the platform altogether,2023-11-27 21:53:00,Oliver Darcy,"The exodus from X is bleeding beyond just major advertisers.In recent days, a number of prominent media brands have not only paused their paid marketing campaigns on the embattled Elon Musk-owned social platform, but have ceased posting on it altogether, going silent on the once essential site that sought to be the world’s “digital town square.”The flagship accounts belonging to Disney, Paramount, Lionsgate, Sony Pictures, Universal, and Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN’s parent company) have not posted on the platform in roughly 10 days, following Musk’s disturbing endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which he still has not apologized for.None of the studios commented on the record when CNN reached out for comment. But people familiar with the social media strategies of Paramount and WBD confirmed under the condition of anonymity that it’s no coincidence: the companies have made the active decision to stop posting under certain handles on X due to concerns, including brand safety.The blackout on X extends beyond these companies’ corporate accounts, in some cases. For instance, the most high profile accounts affiliated with Disney have gone dark on X, such as @StarWars, @Pixar, and @MarvelStudios, which were previously posting multiple times a day on the platform to their millions of followers. Instead, these brands have switched over to the Meta-owned rival Threads, where they have started actively posting.For instance, when “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” on Monday shared the news that host Stephen Colbert would be off the air this week due to appendicitis, the program did so on Threads. Prior to Musk’s backing of an antisemitic post, Colbert’s show, however, was primarily active on X, regularly posting videos and other content. Now, the inverse is true.When reached for comment on Monday, a representative for X did not directly address questions on the loss of the media behemoths on the platform, which must be setting off alarm bells inside the social media company. It is already quite bad for the struggling company to be starved of advertising revenue. It’s even worse if it is also starved of content, particularly from household entities that have helped make the platform the center of real-time discussion for years.It is, of course, possible that these companies will reverse course down the road and resume posting and even advertising on the platform. It would not be the first time that has happened after advertisers have fled an outlet en masse. But it’s also possible that won’t happen.With Musk at the helm of the platform for the foreseeable future overseeing the critical decisions that have led to a surge in hate speech (while also personally contributing himself to the awful rhetoric), the risk versus reward calculus on whether to engage with the company has taken a sharp nosedive. The situation is not dissimilar to when Tucker Carlson permanently chased most advertisers away from Fox News’ 8pm hour during his time at the network.And if more companies and other notable figures abandon Musk’s platform for other social networks, it will extinguish the allure it once had, providing yet another reason for average users to ditch the troubled platform.“Every day, more brands are waking up to the reality that Twitter is dead and X is a cesspool,” Platformer’s Casey Newton said. “The global town square is now dispersed across many different platforms, and increasingly the most relevant conversations are taking place elsewhere.”",3503,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/media/elon-musk-x-ads-reliable-sources/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,news strategy company host permanently rival program post contribute social conspiracy colbert regularly possible platformer loss paramount behemoth tucker inside increasingly handle make center brand endorsement oversee silent dissimilar digital medium directly instance dead reward personally marvelstudios active include affiliate versus platform site million follower late backing foreseeable familiar picture wake reason inverse hour time due road fox disturb bros course cnn start paid alarm provide carlson casey cesspool address share previously troubled reverse sought disperse sony thread pause embattle profile essential decision nosedive particularly warner universal set chase hate monday happen revenue studio abandon allure question x musk appendicitis outlet record speech number anonymity prominent instead network high altogether rhetoric stop future relevant away lionsgate household prior parent bleeding primarily place discovery campaign comment exodus global discussion starve struggle marketing masse figure corporate helm starwars conversation blackout elon town wbd calculus advertising square extinguish roughly ditch antisemitic cease flee reach switch dark risk actively surge twitter world pixar major lead reality show account extends video different representative user newton follow average theory sharp case apologize disney critical advertiser week bell concern air engage multiple coincidence entity recent content confirm awful day condition resume flagship belonging situation notable stephen,-0.97515,0.1712817584927205,10.25796923076923,0.4467286857763047,0,2023-11-27
CNN,Sports Illustrated deletes articles published under fake author names and AI-generated profile photos,2023-11-27 19:54:00,Liam Reilly,"Sports Illustrated on Monday said it had deleted several articles from its website after a report found the once-celebrated legacy magazine had published the pieces under fake author names and profile images generated by artificial intelligence.The report, which was published by Futurism, found that the magazine had repeatedly published articles whose authors could not be found online outside the Sports Illustrated website. The articles were all accompanied by AI-generated profile photos that Futurism also found for sale on digital marketplaces that sell AI-produced headshots.During the course of Futurism’s reporting, some of the alleged Sports Illustrated writers mysteriously vanished from the publication’s website — and their articles began appearing under the names of different authors who similarly didn’t appear to exist online and whose likenesses were also being sold on AI headshot marketplaces.Following the publication of the report, a spokesperson for The Arena Group — which has operated and licensed Sports Illustrated since 2019 — told CNN that the deleted product review articles had been created by a third-party company, AdVon Commerce.“We have learned that AdVon had writers use a pen or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy — actions we don’t condone — and we are removing the content while our internal investigation continues and have since ended the partnership,” the spokesperson said.Writers, editors, and researchers at AdVon create content following a policy that makes use of both counter-plagiarism and counter-AI software, the Arena Group spokesperson said.“We continually monitor our partners and were in the midst of a review when these allegations were raised,” the spokesperson told CNN. “AdVon has assured us that all of the articles in question were written and edited by humans.”AdVon did not respond to a CNN request for comment. But the questions raised Monday marked the second time in as many months that AdVon has found itself at the center of an AI publishing controversy.In October, Gannett-owned Reviewed came under fire following reports it had used AI to produce stories. A similar investigation followed: The website contained several stories written by authors who couldn’t be found online and whose colleagues couldn’t confirm their existence. But Gannett denied the articles had been written with the use of AI.Following Futurism’s report Monday, the Sports Illustrated Union, which represents staff writers for the magazine, said that its members were “horrified” by the allegations.“If true, these practices violate everything we believe in about journalism,” the union said in a statement. “We deplore being associated with something so disrespectful to our readers.”Sports Illustrated writers also reacted with disgust in social media posts.“Along with basic principles of honesty, trust, journalistic ethics, etc. — I take seriously the weight of a Sports Illustrated byline,” Emma Baccellieri, a staff writer for the magazine, posted to X. “It meant something to me long before I ever dreamed of working here. This report was horrifying to read.”“The practices described in the story published today do real damage to the credibility of the hardworking humans I have been honored to work with for the past 9 years,” added Mitch Goldich, another writer and editor at the magazine, posted on X.The Arena Group is not the first publishing company to be ensnared by the rapid deployment of AI. Since the technology’s explosion on the commercial scene nearly one year ago, several news organizations have begun deploying AI to partially automate and expedite the publication of certain kinds of stories, with mixed results. For instance, the Online News Association has published a practical guide for newsrooms to navigate the technology.Still, news organizations are typically wary of producing entire stories using AI, as Gannett learned this summer during an experiment with the technology in which the platform produced several botched high school sports articles.",4052,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/media/sports-illustrated-deletes-articles-fake-author-names-ai-profile-photos/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story partner ethic news company delete typically image post artificial social wary technology union review make center real illustrate year digital dream medium software result likeness principle researcher instance represent react violate platform goldich entire request statement continually horrify time writer honor edit spokesperson today course website trust cnn emma similarly automate navigate long continue deplore accompany baccellieri deny author report associate explosion sell vanished assure privacy allege october past summer organization profile partnership disrespectful mysteriously existence journalism monday sport association learn gannett found monitor fire photo action question write x rapid credibility scene experiment meant month mixed colleague high produce license fake midst publication practice contain believe reporting policy disgust marked similar school advon pen piece allegation comment repeatedly begin weight magazine kind legacy protect raise work publishing add operate investigation byline ago told generate editor damage commercial pseudo online condone mitch futurism remove newsroom exist journalistic publish product headshot botch deployment member different follow practical marketplace ensnare hardworking expedite described respond arena guide basic deploy group partially content confirm internal human create staff article honesty,-0.4044,0.1480750246791708,12.46581196581197,0.3605137844611528,0,2023-11-27

It was displayed at Kensington Palace from 2017 to 2019 as part of an exhibition of the princess’ clothes.Another of Diana’s outfits, an evening dress she wore in public twice, is expected to sell for up to $200,000 at the same auction.With its black velvet bodice embroidered with stars, a dropped waist, padded shoulders and blue skirt, the dress is evocative of the fashion of the 1980s, when Diana became a style icon.Other items in the auction include memorabilia used or worn by some of Hollywood’s biggest stars in the 1950s and 1960s.A yellow wool Givenchy coat worn by Audrey Hepburn in the 1963 movie “Charade” is expected to sell for up to $40,000 while a carriage clock once owned by Marilyn Monroe could fetch $4,000.The sale is due to take place in Beverly Hills and online between December 14 and December 17.",1889,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/style/princess-diana-blouse-auction-intl-scli/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,fashion memorabilia hill charles left satin expect hepburn ribbon item salvage engagement emanuel velvet auction lord yellow december julien make movie diana prince palace charade givenchy book place king outfit part blouse magazine carriage include shoulder evocative underneath portrait pad house fetch design kensington fabric damage pose conduct wore exhibition online displayed worn due skirt style bow pale elizabeth accord big complete hollywood collar public newspaper love waist wool marilyn monroe black snowdon stain sell direct wedding client tie iii audrey held star bodice dress drop mascara david princess famously embroider clock vogue fell rack designer pink blue write coat beverly,0.2899,0.0,8.812506738544474,0.2655555555555555,0,2023-11-27

Instead, Evangelista claimed it caused paradoxical adipose hyperplasia (PAH), a rare side effect of the fat-freezing procedure, which causes fatty tissue thickens and enlarge in the treated area.The former model sued for $50 million, but the terms of the settlement have not been made public.In her latest interview, Evangelista said therapy has helped her even as the lumps on her body are softening.“Well, I don’t blame myself any more. I’m not hard on myself any longer. And how people feel about me still bothers me a little bit, but it used to bother me a lot.

CNN,It’s time to limit how often we can travel abroad – ‘carbon passports’ may be the answer,2023-11-27 07:45:00,not specified,"The summer of 2023 was very significant for the travel industry. By the end of July, international tourist arrivals globally reached 84% of pre-pandemic levels. In some European countries, such as France, Denmark and Ireland, tourism demand even surpassed its pre-pandemic level.This may be great news economically, but there’s concern that a return to the status quo is already showing dire environmental and social consequences.The summer saw record-breaking heatwaves across many parts of the world. People were forced to flee wildfires in Greece and Hawaii, and extreme weather warnings were issued in many popular holiday destinations like Portugal, Spain and Turkey. Experts attributed these extreme conditions to climate change.Tourism is part of the problem. The tourism sector generates around one-tenth of the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis.The negative impacts of tourism on the environment have become so severe that some are suggesting drastic changes to our travel habits are inevitable. In a report from 2023 that analyzed the future of sustainable travel, tour operator Intrepid Travel proposed that “carbon passports” will soon become a reality if the tourism industry hopes to survive.The idea of a carbon passport centers on each traveler being assigned a yearly carbon allowance that they cannot exceed. These allowances can then “ration” travel.This concept may seem extreme. But the idea of personal carbon allowances is not new. A similar concept (called “personal carbon trading”) was discussed by UK Parliament in 2008, before being shut down because of to its perceived complexity and the possibility of public resistance.The average annual carbon footprint for a person in the US is 16 tons – one of the highest rates in the world. In the UK this figure sits at 11.7 tons, still more than five times the figure recommended by the Paris Agreement to keep global temperature rise below 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.Globally, the average annual carbon footprint of a person is closer to 4 tons. But, to have the best chance of preventing temperature rise from overshooting 2 Celsius, the average global carbon footprint needs to drop to under two tons by 2050. This figure equates to around two roundtrip flights between London and New York.Intrepid Travel’s report predicts that we will see carbon passports in action by 2040. However, several laws and restrictions have been put in place over the past year that suggest our travel habits may already be on the verge of change.Between 2013 and 2018, the amount of CO₂ emitted by commercial aircraft worldwide increased by 32%. Improvements in fuel efficiency are slowly reducing per passenger emissions. But research from 2014 found that whatever the industry’s efforts to reduce its carbon emissions, they will be outweighed by the growth in air traffic.For emission reductions to have any meaningful effect, ticket prices would have to rise by 1.4% each year, discouraging some people from flying. However, in reality, ticket prices have been falling.Some European countries are beginning to take measures to reduce air travel. As of April 1, 2023, passengers on short-haul flights and older aircraft in Belgium have been subject to increased taxes to encourage alternative forms of travel.Less than two months later, France banned short-haul domestic flights where the same trip can be made by train in two-and-a-half hours or less. Spain is expected to follow suit.A similar scheme could also be on the horizon for Germany. In 2021, a YouGov poll found that 70% of Germans would support such measures to fight climate change if alternative transport routes like trains or ships were available.It’s not just air travel that’s being criticized. An investigation by the European Federation for Transport and Environment in 2023 found that cruise ships pump four times as many sulphuric gases (which are proven to cause acid rain and several respiratory conditions) into the atmosphere than all of Europe’s 291 million cars combined.Statistics like these have forced European destinations to take action against the cruise industry. In July, Amsterdam’s council banned cruise ships from docking in the city center in a bid to reduce tourism and pollution – an initiative that has shown success elsewhere.In 2019, Venice was the most polluted European port, due to large numbers of cruise ship visits. But it dropped to 41st place in 2022 after a ban on large cruise ships entering the city’s waters reduced air pollutants from ships in Venice by 80%.Intrepid Travel’s report also highlights that not only how we travel, but where we travel will soon be impacted by climate change. Boiling temperatures will probably diminish the allure of traditional beach destinations, prompting European tourists to search for cooler destinations such as Belgium, Slovenia and Poland for their summer holidays.Several travel agencies reported seeing noticeable increases in holiday bookings to cooler European destinations like Scandinavia, Ireland and the UK during 2023’s peak summer travel months.Whatever the solution may be, changes to our travel habits look inevitable. Destinations across the globe, from Barcelona to the Italian riveria and even Mount Everest are already calling for limits on tourist numbers as they struggle to cope with crowds and pollution.Holidaymakers should prepare to change their travel habits now, before this change is forced upon them.Ross Bennett-Cook is a visiting lecturer, School of Architecture + Cities, University of Westminster",5591,https://www.cnn.com/travel/carbon-passports-explainer/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,discourage news international pump slowly environment pollution effect poland passenger barcelona social port growth traditional significant pollute emit trading demand belgium center rise make cooler efficiency great year poll level initiative fuel surpass alternative industry allowance agreement part dire extreme reduce operator severe water million rate change expert warning europe prompt atmosphere ticket form hour closer time due bid propose london april scheme tax drive shut enter crowd sustainable slovenia exceed ban train highlight possibility parliament reduction call scandinavia horizon city agency personal wildfire diminish overshoot report impact roundtrip aircraft past summer probably yearly issue encourage italian trip globally gas perceive drop architecture search beach globe idea mount measure yougov found emission price amsterdam action allure suggest flight peak domestic university number traveler paris sector verge month pollutant european sits subject expect federation fahrenheit fly high boil recommend limit intrepid future country solution force similar school holiday celsius large place effort tourist heatwaves begin person global concept spain struggle popular habit quo footprint investigation figure temperature travel prepare hawaii predicts research environmental attribute council commercial complexity portugal annual inevitable drastic status put ireland france destination meaningful respiratory arrival economically tour flee reach noticeable german denmark worldwide ration greece climate discuss dock july improvement world visit amount public everest reality cruise show cope transport ship return law car greenhouse assign follow germany average outweigh westminster criticize restriction weather problem sulphuric riveria tourism success venice rain negative generates chance prevent uk concern route analyze air passport turkey hope acid lecturer fight increase condition booking support carbon equates proven,0.8993,0.375603648721159,12.020391349124612,0.3399541331684189,0,2023-11-27
CNN,"Ozzy Osbourne opens up about health struggles, saying he will ‘die a happy man’ if he can perform one last show",2023-11-27 07:00:00,Issy Ronald,"Rock icon Ozzy Osbourne opened up about his health struggles in a recent interview with Rolling Stone, and said he would “die a happy man” if he could perform one more show to express his gratitude to his fans from the stage.“If I can’t continue doing shows on a regular basis, I just want to be well enough to do one show where I can say, ‘Hi guys, thanks so much for my life.’ That’s what I’m working towards, and if I drop down dead at the end of it, I’ll die a happy man,” he said.The 74-year-old announced in February that his touring career was over as he is no longer “physically capable (of it)” after suffering several health setbacks. In July, he withdrew from an appearance at a music festival scheduled for October.Osbourne damaged his spine in a major accident four years ago, has undergone multiple surgeries since, and revealed his Parkinson’s diagnosis in January 2020.The fall and subsequent surgeries “really knocked me about,” Osbourne said. “The second surgery went drastically wrong and virtually left me crippled. I thought I’d be up and running after the second and third, but with the last one they put a f**king rod in my spine. They found a tumor in one of the vertebrae, so they had to dig all that out too. It’s pretty rough, man.”Although Osbourne has performed intermittently during that period, including at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in his hometown of Birmingham, England, he has been largely absent from the stage.During his career – which began as a member of groundbreaking heavy metal band Black Sabbath – Osbourne won Grammy Awards for both his solo work and as part of the band, which he left in 1979.He became famous for his colorful performances as well as his music, especially throughout the 1980s, including when he threw raw meat onto concertgoers, and bit into a dead bat tossed on the stage by a fan (Osbourne had thought it was rubber. It was not).“I’m taking it one day at a time, and if I can perform again, I will,” he said. “But it’s been like saying farewell to the best relationship of my life. At the start of my illness, when I stopped touring, I was really pissed off with myself, the doctors, and the world. But as time has gone on, I’ve just gone, ‘Well, maybe I’ve just got to accept that fact.’”Performing as “a half-hearted Ozzy looking for sympathy,” is out of the question, though, the legendary singer said.“I’ve seen Phil Collins perform recently, and he’s got virtually the same problems as me,” he added. “He gets up there in a wheelchair! But I couldn’t do that.”",2557,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/entertainment/ozzy-osbourne-health-struggles-intl-scli/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,stage piss suffer run express longer doctor accept left rubber heavy osbourne schedule collins announce solo bit award guy health surgery subsequent commonwealth stop groundbreaking setback vertebra year performance intermittently wheelchair roll undergone king dead begin part birmingham happy gratitude include struggle phil relationship work knock england singer life recently add perform february parkinson appearance ago period threw damage famous festival time largely grammy especially put concertgoers farewell rough wrong tour game interview regular rod f rock pretty start accident continue ozzy july world cripple major sympathy sabbath band music show january withdrew member black drastically illness basis closing spine problem legendary virtually career meat tumor ceremony absent multiple drop diagnosis stone recent hometown found raw day metal capable toss question open fall icon reveal colorful physically,-0.11485,0.2346499804458349,5.440636042402826,0.3797611014716278,0,2023-11-27
CNN,Irish writer Paul Lynch’s dystopian novel ‘Prophet Song’ wins 2023 Booker Prize,2023-11-27 05:54:00,not specified,"Irish writer Paul Lynch won the 2023 Booker Prize on Sunday for his novel “Prophet Song,” the story of a family and a country on the brink of catastrophe as an imaginary Irish government veers towards tyranny.The novel, Lynch’s fifth, seeks to show the unrest in Western democracies and their indifference towards disasters such as the implosion of Syria.“From that first knock at the door, ‘Prophet Song’ forces us out of our complacency as we follow the terrifying plight of a woman seeking to protect her family in an Ireland descending into totalitarianism,” Esi Edugyan, chair of the Booker’s 2023 judges, said.“This is a triumph of emotional storytelling, bracing and brave.”Lynch, who was previously the chief film critic of Ireland’s Sunday Tribune newspaper, said he wanted readers to understand totalitarianism by heightening the dystopia with the intense realism of his writing.“I wanted to deepen the reader’s immersion to such a degree that by the end of the book, they would not just know, but feel this problem for themselves,” Lynch said in comments published on the Booker Prize website.He became the fifth Irish author to win the Booker Prize, after Iris Murdoch, John Banville, Roddy Doyle and Anne Enright, the organizers of the competition said.

MSNBC,Elon Musk's newest defamation lawsuit highlights X's toxicity,2023-11-26 12:39:00,Zeeshan Aleem,"Once again, Elon Musk, the owner of the platform X, is facing a defamation lawsuit. And once again one has to ask: What is this man doing running one of the most influential social media platforms in the world? One day in June, Ben Brody, who had just graduated from college, started receiving odd texts from his friends. They said there was a rumor circulating online that he was an undercover federal agent who was trying to provoke fights between brawling neo-Nazi groups in Oregon. Sitting at home in California, the confused Brody initially thought it was all a prank. It’s bad enough to be the subject of an online mob’s false conspiracy theory. It’s worse when one of the most influential men in the world seems to cosign that theory. It wasn’t. Unbeknownst to Brody, online sleuths had been searching for the identity of an unmasked participant in a skirmish that had recently broken out between two far-right groups near a Pride Night near Portland. Some of the self-appointed investigators had mistakenly identified Brody as the unmasked man in a video, and after delving into Brody’s publicly biographical information — indicating that he was a college student who said he was interested in working in government — they surmised that he was an undercover “fed” and agent provocateur. It’s bad enough to be the subject of an online mob’s false conspiracy theory. It’s worse when one of the most influential men in the world seems to cosign that theory. On X, Musk responded encouragingly to multiple posts making speculative or false claims about Brody. Even after Brody had posted a video with evidence that he had been in California when the fight occurred, Musk suggested he believed Brody was in Oregon and likely part of some kind of operation. “Looks like one is a college student (who wants to join the govt) and another is maybe an Antifa member,” he wrote. “But nonetheless a probable false flag situation.” Musk also tagged “Community Notes,” a feature on X that allows users to append notes to posts that are intended to add context to or fact-check widely circulated posts. Musk, who is followed by over 150 million users, turbocharged the online mob. Brody said was doxxed and harassed, and, at one point, he left his home with his mother out of concern for their safety. Brody is suing Musk for making “reckless” claims about him that damaged his reputation and endangered him. “Musk’s personal endorsement of the false accusation against Ben Brody reverberated across the internet, transforming the accusation from anonymous rumor to gospel truth for many individuals, and causing others to use Musk’s endorsement to justify their desire to harass Ben Brody and his family,” Brody’s lawsuit says. (Musk’s attorney told CNN that “we expect this case to be dismissed.”) Whether or not Musk violated the law, it is clear he acted irresponsibly. Musk knows that he is, by many measures, one of the most influential people in the world and that his commentary encourages tribal reactions among his followers. Rather than ignore or express skepticism toward a group of amateur detectives online who were whipping up an online mob around a 22-year-old, Musk instead lent it his tremendous power and did nothing to counteract the wave of hatred — and awkward Google search results — that immediately crashed on Brody. Musk’s behavior wasn't only personally irresponsible; it was yet another sign that he is precisely the wrong kind of person to helm a social media company. Musk has already shown on many occasions that he isn’t the champion of free speech that he claimed to be before purchasing the company. But on top of that, he also shows disregard for the idea of fostering meaningful speech. One way to encourage meaningful speech is to take reasonable measures to mitigate the spread of misinformation. Instead, Musk has systematically dismantled any such safeguards during his tenure at X. He scrapped the verified badges that allowed users to confirm accounts’ identities; disbanded the company' trust and safety teams; stripped (or selectively enforced) badges meant to show whether accounts were government-affiliated, thus hurting users’ ability to sniff out propaganda; and eagerly reactivated previously banned right-wing troll accounts that thrive on spreading false rumors (while seemingly suppressing left-leaning accounts). Musk's handling of the Brody incident also modeled a kind of behavior that encourages the spread of life-altering misinformation about private citizens. Musk is creating an online space most hospitable to bullies and merchants of misinformation. That’s not only civically deplorable, but it’s also bad for business. X’s value has already dropped precipitously since he bought it last year; making it a place where even its owner encourages harassment of random users isn’t going to make fleeing advertisers any more likely to consider coming back. Regardless of whether Brody succeeds against Musk — who has won defamation lawsuits before — Musk should re-evaluate the kind of reckless, society-corroding behavior he’s encouraging on his platform. I’m not optimistic that’s going to happen. Zeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

CNN,Melissa Barrera speaks out after ‘Scream VII’ departure: ‘Silence is not an option’,2023-11-23 13:00:00,not specified,"Melissa Barrera is speaking out after being let go from the production of “Scream VII.”The actress has been one of the recent stars of the slasher franchise and was expected to be in the next installment. But that is no longer the case following previous social media posts she made about the war between Israel and Hamas that the studio behind the the film characterized as antisemitic.When reached Thursday, a spokesperson for Spyglass directed CNN to the following statement about Barrerra’s departure.“Spyglass’ stance is unequivocally clear: We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech,” the statement reads.CNN has reached out to representatives for Barrera for additional comment.On Wednesday, Barrera posted a statement on the Instagram stories portion of her account, after the news broke of her departure from the “Scream” franchise.“First and foremost I condemn antisemitism and Islamophobia. I condemn hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people,” she wrote. “As a Latina, a proud Mexicana, I feel the responsibility of having a platform that allows me the privilege of being heard, and therefore I have tried to use it to raise awareness about issues I care about and to lend my voice to those in need.”She continued by writing, “Every person on this earth … deserves equal human rights, dignity and, of course, freedom. I believe a group of people are NOT their leadership, and that no governing body should be above criticism.”“I pray day and night for no more deaths, for no more violence, and for peaceful co-existence,” she concluded her statement. “I will continue to speak out for those that need it most and continue to advocate for peace and safety, for human rights and freedom.

CNN,Colombian superstar Shakira settles tax evasion suit with Spanish authorities,2023-11-20 11:06:00,Al Goodman,"Colombian superstar Shakira settled her tax evasion suit with the Spanish authorities on Monday, avoiding a trial that was due to start that day.The Grammy-winning singer admitted the charges against her and agreed to pay the amount owed in full and an additional fine, according to a statement released by the Barcelona prosecutor’s office on Monday afternoon.She paid a total of €17.5 million ($19 million), an amount composed of the taxes she owed plus interest, as well as a fine of €7.3 million ($8 million), the statement said.Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of more than eight years in prison if Shakira were convicted on all six counts of tax fraud. But the settlement said that, instead of prison, she would pay additional fines of about $437 a day for a three-year sentence, or just over $470,000.Monday’s court proceedings lasted about 10 minutes, during which time the judge announced a last-minute agreement submitted by all parties to avoid trial. Shakira was asked by the judge if she was aware of the deal and the latest fines agreed, to which the singer responded “yes.”A statement released by the singer’s communication team shortly afterward announced her lawyers reached an agreement to end a tax case that covered the years between 2012 and 2014.Shakira said in a statement that she “was ready to face trial and defend my innocence,” but came “to the conclusion that it is not a triumph to win if the price is that (they) steal so many years of life.”“I had two options: keep fighting until the end, taking my peace of mind and that of my children, stop making songs, albums and tours, without being able to enjoy my career and the things I like; or agree, close and leave this chapter of my life behind, looking forward (to the future),” she added.Spanish prosecutors had alleged the Colombian singer failed to pay personal income and wealth tax between 2012 and 2014, currently valued at about $15.6 million.In a 2021 ruling, Judge Marco Jesús Juberías said Shakira lived in Spain for more than 200 days in each of those three years, making her liable to pay taxes.Spain’s tax code states that anyone who resides in the country for at least six months and a day – or 183 days – in a given year is liable to pay taxes.The star disputed that, calling the accusations “false” in an interview with Elle magazine in September 2022.“First of all, I didn’t spend 183 days per year at that time at all. I was busy fulfilling my professional commitments around the world. Second, I’ve paid everything they claimed I owed, even before they filed a lawsuit. So as of today, I owe zero to them,” the artist told the magazine, adding she would have her day in court as “a matter of principle.”",2708,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/20/entertainment/shakira-trial-spain-intl-scli/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180703124829-claudia-rebaza-profile-photo.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,due settlement sentence evasion chapter magazine instead proceeding paid code trial pay shakira personal currently steal agreement start ready forward peace aware fraud accord tax triumph child busy office interview million prosecutor enjoy fulfil mind september call reach allege career innocence settle owe told spain minute artist leave song full case tour liable claimed convict fail false day world accusation party authority album month ruling barcelona life charge year suit respond amount communication compose win option conclusion avoid give jesús value admit today spanish superstar live defend statement announce shortly matter cover income stop commitment lawsuit monday resides principle country prison team juberías time court deal lawyer fine star file count agree fight marco singer interest zero colombian late close price professional additional dispute state afterward make wealth release judge add future spend total submit,0.7245999999999999,0.0,7.846338797814205,0.4102777777777779,0,2023-11-20
CNN,‘The Hesitant Fiancée’s’ 19th-century eye roll is connecting with fed-up women on TikTok,2023-11-19 04:00:00,Scottie Andrew,"Behold, a woman fuming.Though she’s dressed in an opulent, fur-trimmed gown in a palatial French home sometime in the mid-19th century, her silent fury is recognizable to women the world over who’ve contained their ire to an eye roll.She’s “The Hesitant Fiancée,” the eponymous subject of the painter Auguste Toulmouche’s 1866 painting. The realist work, which had been overshadowed in art history by the arrival of French Impressionist painters soon after, is being reappraised more than 150 years later by art buffs on TikTok.She’s inspired scores of interpretations from users who imagine the undoubtedly irritated thoughts going through her mind when she was painted — “you’d look so much prettier with a smile on your face” — becoming something of a meme template. She’s appreciated by women who share her disillusionment with confining gender roles. And she’s inviting feminist reassessments of the painting itself.When “The Hesitant Fiancée” was first exhibited, works depicting the quiet indignation of women were sometimes seen as unserious, and much of the popular art at the time satirized single women, said Kathryn Brown, associate professor of art history and visual culture at Loughborough University in the UK.But seen through contemporary eyes, “The Hesitant Fiancée” shows women in solidarity, supporting each other in “negotiating oppressive systems,” noted Brown, who wrote about Toulmouche’s work in the monograph “Women Readers in French Painting 1870–1890.”“Over a century and a half later, perhaps we’re still discovering the full political significance of that kind of unity,” she said in an email.Toulmouche painted scenes of elegant, wealthy French women in domestic settings, often chronicling their romantic exploits. The women in his paintings were, on the surface, little more than sumptuously dressed debutantes — the French novelist Émile Zola in 1874 called Toulmouche’s subjects “delicious dolls,” Brown said.Toulmouche’s paintings were successful in their day partly because of the “fantasy of female life” they depicted: The women in his works are wives, mothers, sisters and daughters who don’t stray from their roles in the domestic sphere, Brown said.“The Hesitant Fiancée,” also translated to “The Reluctant Bride,” was originally exhibited under the title “Un mariage de raison,” or “A Marriage of Convenience” at the Académie des Beaux-Arts’ Paris Salon in 1866, Brown said. Toulmouche’s work was popular for a time, with his paintings often recreated as etchings in newspapers, Brown noted. But he was eventually overshadowed by Impressionist painters like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas, she said.While Toulmouche was “by no means a painter of feminist art,” Brown said, the women in his paintings are interpreted today as slyly subversive.In the 1865 painting “Forbidden Fruit,” three young women excitedly pore over books in a library while a fourth appears to guard the door. They’ve snuck into this room searching for information — “undoubtedly about sex,” Brown added, based on their wry smiles — that’s been kept from them.Brown suggests that the four women in “Forbidden Fruit” reappear in “The Hesitant Fiancée,” now supporting one of their own in her unhappy slog toward the altar.“One of the four young women from ‘Forbidden Fruit’ is now about to be married, perhaps to the ‘wrong’ person or because she doesn’t want to marry at all,” Brown said. “Read as a narrative that unfolds across the two works, it looks like the young woman from ‘Forbidden Fruit’ knows what’s about to happen to her.”The revival of “The Hesitant Fiancée” has been centuries in the making. Popular art accounts on TikTok started posting about it over the last few weeks, discovering it with glee, though at least one user, art enthusiast Kira (@TheArtRevival), shared a video about Toulmouche in February. She said in an email that she’s long loved his work.“One of my favorite subjects in art is fancy ladies lounging around, living life with apathy,” she said. “Few can relate to their lives but nearly all can relate to their disdain.”The popular user Tatyana About Art said that “The Hesitant Fiancée” is really a tragedy. The subject of the painting is likely depicted moments away from — or moments after — marrying the husband she’s less than in love with. She’s flanked by two women who gently attempt to comfort her while another plays with a flower crown in the mirror, perhaps dreaming of her own wedding day.“The bride is completely alone in her sentiment of doom and unwillingness,” art historian Tatyana said in a video about “The Hesitant Fiancée.”Today, though, some TikTok-ers view the titular fiancée as a rebel, not entering quietly into a marriage she’s unhappy about. Some users have theorized that she may not have been attracted to men at all, and since homosexuality was still viewed as immoral in 19th-century France, living openly would’ve been near-impossible at the time.While we may never know the full story of the woman skulking in the armchair, her fed-up mien is familiar to anyone who’s ever had to swallow their anger. She’s trapped, said Kira, and “we’ve all been there.” That she’s expressing it within the confines of her rigid societal role is still captivating over a century later.“I see her and think, ‘Yes babe, roll those eyes,’” Kira said.",5313,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/19/style/the-hesitant-fiancee-tiktok-eye-roll-cec/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/toulmouche-bride-crop.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,crown wedding user satirize title attract rebel societal successful dress unfolds salon rigid historian dream reappear impressionist romantic domestic sumptuously skulk attempt flank gender narrative originally unwillingness start tatyana armchair express contemporary homosexuality overshadow doll sphere fantasy love sister happen swallow mind irritated template reluctant view edgar moment fourth translate brown marriage married scene full partly excitedly slyly reassessment anger search woman lady kathryn note exhibit quiet university favorite person appreciate depict write flower imagine enter fury elegant interpret fancy chronicle pore palatial french unhappy setting marry sentiment zola relate feminist opulent kind completely immoral indignation base buff contain living political slog home toulmouche art gown add account claude babe invite fiancée confines wealthy unity raison discover wry single newspaper visual fruit familiar bride work half significance theorize book popular reader eponymous académie suggests recognizable wrong stray post play surface library unserious gently émile eye system mirror theartrevival email subject mien call mother sex etching husband room wife revival guard oppressive silent eventually inspire away enthusiast titular undoubtedly world week day smile share young snuck life read year roll captivate monet story apathy france associate trap disillusionment today information convenience negotiate support solidarity century painter interpretation paint exploit novelist video hesitant time tiktok delicious comfort female prettier long doom arrival show role meme debutante score professor ire culture quietly loughborough mariage daughter openly history behold february lounge painting degas paris make auguste recreate monograph tragedy realist reappraise confine forbidden glee,0.9741,0.508187464709204,8.584787133396404,0.4255036630036629,0,2023-11-19

CNN,‘The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes’ falls flat in going back to the future,2023-11-16 07:00:00,Brian Lowry,"Set 64 years before the movie that launched the cinematic franchise, “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” is the prequel nobody really needed, exploring the origins of Panem’s authoritarian leader Coriolanus Snow. Splitting the movie into three chapters seems appropriate, since the film delivers a trifecta: overwrought, overacted, and overlong.The somewhat intriguing conceit in adapting Suzanne Collins’ novel involves how the Hunger Games came to be, and how the young Snow (played by Donald Sutherland in the earlier movies) essentially descended to the dark side.Unfortunately, this fresh-faced version of Snow (played by British actor Tom Blyth, of the “Billy the Kid” TV series) is a particularly bland construct, joining other privileged young residents of the Capitol in serving as mentors to the youths chosen to compete and die as tributes.Snow’s charge is Lucy Gray Baird (“West Side Story’s” Rachel Zegler, who hopefully will be served better by “Snow White”), who hails from District 12, arriving with a natural flair for playing to the cameras, a killer singing voice and an unfortunately distracting Southern-ish accent.Snow is understandably smitten, and he soon begins scheming to ensure that Lucy survives the deadly competition. Still, that means navigating its eagle-eyed masterminds, Casca Highbottom (Peter Dinklage, who, as in “Game of Thrones,” both drinks and knows things) and Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), the latter appearing to channel Cruella de Vil in her look and line delivery.Keeping Lucy alive won’t be easy. And as Highbottom bluntly tells Snow, the mentors’ task is simply to help create good television, developing “spectacles, not survivors.”Of course, “The Hunger Games” and director Francis Lawrence (who oversaw the three initial sequels) are no strangers to flamboyant performances, which here also includes Jason Schwartzman conjuring a few welcome laughs as Lucky Flickerman, a weatherman turned emcee of the games with a familiar surname.Still, “Songbirds & Snakes” careens all over the place, from its limp romantic aspect to the personalities of the various mentors and tributes, which beyond the central duo barely register. Perhaps that’s why the movie features a whole lot of action and sumptuous sets and still manages to feel like a bit of a bore.In some respects, the chapter format makes the film play like a limited streaming series, which, given the prequel narrative, might have offered a way to better flesh out this dense roster of unknown characters.As is, “The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” might issue a siren song to curious “Hunger Games” fans, but for those on the fringes, it’s not a call worth answering.“The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” premieres November 17 in US theaters.

CNN,This US couple sold their house and moved to Italy for good,2023-11-13 09:52:00,Silvia Marchetti,"The pandemic’s enforced period of no travel led an American couple to rethink their life and retire to sunny southern Italy.Seventysomethings Glenda and Randy Tuminello from Spokane, Washington, retired in December 2022 to Polignano a Mare, a dazzling white, cliffside town in the Puglia region, renowned for its stunning beaches and turquoise waters.The pandemic outbreak, they say, forced them to reconsider longterm life projects, and look for a tax-friendly spot where they could make the most of their Italian dream.“We had originally planned [pre-Covid-19] to go spend a year in Italy, celebrating retirement. But then Covid struck and during those two ‘no travel’ years we began to rethink our original plans,” Glenda Tuminello, a, a former high school math teacher and home designer, tells CNN Travel.“We decided to sell our home, our car and all superfluous possessions and make Italy our retirement home for good. We chose beautiful Polignano a Mare, it offered a flat tax rate of 7%” – introduced by the government to lure foreign retirees.Other plus points were the town’s fantastic historic center, friendly residents, and coastal location with unique gorgeous views – as well as the very affordable lifestyle on offer.“We don’t need a car here. It’s just a few minutes’ walk to the train station that could take us anywhere we want to go in Italy, as well as any European country that we want to visit,” she says.The couple have made new friends, including other American residents, and adore Polignano’s festive vibe with celebrations and music always going on in the picturesque piazzas.“Locals bring their lawn chairs out at night to the promenade area by the Adriatic to sit out and talk, visit, laugh into the late hours of the night. It is so lovely, so upbeat, so family-oriented. We never ever feel anything but safe here – [there’s] never a threat of danger walking the beautiful streets at night,” she says.Randy Tuminello, a former consulting manager in architecture, had a further ancestry lure: his grandparents migrated to the US from the Sicilian fishing village of Cefalù in the early 1900s, settling in Louisiana.“My roots have been a huge factor in picking Italy, it’s like coming home, and we feel more at home here than we ever felt in the US. Then again my wife is an Italian at heart and loves everything Italian,” he says.The couple looked at different southern Italian regions offering a 7% flat tax for new immigrant retirees, before picking Puglia.The house they rent, located in Polignano’s historic center, costs $1,200 a month. They saw the ad online and it was love at first sight. The home was perfect – right down to the finest detail. It came partly furnished, including the tableware.“We were going to buy it at first, but now with the economy unsure, it was best to rent,” says Randy Tuminello. “It was a decision made at the right time as rentals are now skyrocketing, and homes on sale are quite expensive as there are few and most are taken as B&Bs.”The two-bedroom house has an office, spacious dining room, balcony, front porch with a little garden, and another covered terrace area where the Tuminellos enjoy morning coffee.It’s a typical white stone home tucked in a picturesque winding alley, with an arched portal entrance, vaulted ceilings, terracotta floors and thick walls dotted with jutting-out rocks.Randy Tuminello says their “overriding desire” to relocate to Polignano a Mare came from their preference for Italian culture over American.“The materialistic aspect is not as predominant in Polignano as in the US, and there’s more a sense of community – of family and friends,” he says.Even though they’ve left behind at home kids and grandkids, the couple says their new life is comfy and lacks nothing. All they have to do is to make sure they have a good time every single day – as if they were on holiday. Going out for dinner and evening walks along the promenade overlooking the Adriatic are their preferred activities.Despite living on the coast, the pair aren’t beachgoers. Despite spending nearly a year in Polignano, they have yet to go to the town’s little beach, which is enclosed by cliffs like a fjord, nor had the pleasure of a nice dip in the translucent sea – which the Tuminellos prefer to admire from afar.But southern Italy’s charm comes with challenges – like when they had to fix the air conditioner one sultry summer day.The unexpected rising temperatures in southern Italy are too much even for Louisiana natives. This past summer the heat kept them from moving around and carrying out daily plans – they had to go out early in morning when it was still bearable.And they miss some American foods, like barbecue sauce, peanut butter and lemon curd – though they’ve found a place in Polignano where they can get some US condiments.The language barrier is an issue, too. Glenda Tuminello thinks they need to learn Italian to show respect to locals. As it is, when they go to the grocery to buy pecorino cheese, they always fear they’re not asking for the right amount, ending up with too much or too little. They also get lost in translation at the yogurt store.One positive that the Tuminellos have noted are the incredible driving skills of southern Italians who always “stop on a dime.”Glenda Tuminello says moving to Italy was simply “one of those no-brainers that you better pounce on while you can!”That’s because the couple was supported throughout the entire relocation process and by Finding La Dolce Vita, an Italy-based firm that assists would-be expats.“There is a great amount of work that goes into the legal preparations in Italy if you want to actually live there,” says Glenda Tuminello.The pair applied for the elective residence visa, which requires a passive income of 38,000 euros ($40,700) per couple. There were plenty of hoops to jump through.“It took almost one year to complete all the required background paperwork needed. We wanted to get it right the first time,” she says.",5989,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/polignano-puglia-americans/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231109102916-01b-americans-moved-to-italy-escape-covid.jpg?c=original&q=h_618,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,local furnish offer white sell entrance promenade expensive beach legal fix upbeat nice fishing online peanut place barbecue simply safe night tucked project car chair typical great originally vita mare superfluous overlook rental detail former tax celebration preference struck preparation pick language period cheese learn love lure village introduce sicilian incredible economy designer found spot drive original settle view minute relocate architecture barrier family retire coastal partly festive walk positive outbreak stun government pounce kid retirement cnn require washington alley thick note spokane left european feel food summer enclose historic override sunny euro threat challenge portal sight early coast unique felt decide longterm friendly puglia cliffside danger beautiful materialistic front cover income possession foreign december flat wind stop american country stone center past garden fine passive grandparent cefalù adriatic tuminellos math rent vault terrace elective living street rate home buy dip issue spacious skill lemon spend jump sultry dot factor cliff adore lose italian vibe charm dinner plan move single native find root gorgeous turquoise work carry louisiana entire lifestyle skyrocket comfy consult reconsider region terracotta prefer apply arch relocation include talk butter visa pair cost high complete laugh translation office beachgoers glenda immigrant train sauce rethink enjoy hour celebrate porch ceiling dolce lack manager ancestry room friend translucent wife lead resident background hoop picturesque balcony floor plenty location heat fjord affordable couple point day desire randy locate firm fantastic month air renowned life year spending bring house force b amount conditioner lovely wall predominant covid admire italy enforce grocery live begin holiday different huge daily despite support school dazzle area decision paperwork teacher time chose respect morning migrate offering unexpected lawn residence perfect unsure aspect assist show retiree tuminello late pleasure yogurt process rise community music culture southern grandkids pecorino temperature travel pandemic visit fear make station miss town curd heart polignano,0.9981,0.3005510101853398,8.605845369583683,0.391411544011544,0,2023-11-13

Other online screenshots indicated the cheap prices were offered for about two hours on the carrier’s app as well as across several ticket-booking platforms, including market leader Trip.com.On top of that price, buyers were required to pay at least an additional 110 yuan ($15) in airport fees and fuel surcharges.“Passengers can use them as normal,” Guangzhou-based China Southern said, on the proviso that tickets were already paid for and issued.Reporting by Sophie Yu and Casey Hall; Editing by Bernadette Baum",1147,https://www.cnn.com/travel/china-southern-airline-tickets-glitch/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231110112056-china-southern-airlines-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,sophie cheaply fee edit require market reporting offer screenshots chengdu medium flight mobile buyer paid hall wednesday online pay beijing minimum passenger southwest social platform screenshot thursday chinese ticket include begin baum available app circulate china yuan indicate top hour normal airline show yu casey late compare honor price southern glitch additional proviso fuel bernadette airport technical metropolis phone cheap leader carrier,0.6241,0.0,10.288930232558137,0.3495614035087719,0,2023-11-12
CNN,Inside Turkey’s ‘hidden’ ski world,2023-11-10 08:38:00,Rob Hodgetts,"Peering out of the plane window, he spotted the priceless “white gold.” Towering, snow-laden peaks stretching for miles on the southern edge of the Black Sea.It was as if he could see his future. He knew he’d have to take a closer look.Swiss mountain guide Thierry Gasser was on his way home from a heli-skiing trip in Kyrgyzstan in 2001, when from his seat he saw the familiar Caucasus mountains to the north and an intriguing chain of shining peaks to the south.Gazing through “perfect blue skies,” Gasser was looking at the Kaçkar range in northeast Turkey.“The first look from the plane was perfect, they were huge mountains and a large mountain range – that was the green light for us to go there and check every valley and every mountain,” Gasser tells CNN Travel.He was already on the lookout for a destination in which to set up his own heli-ski business after years of working around the world as a guide for other operators. He had only three criteria: proximity to Europe to avoid jet lag, a big, high-altitude mountain range, and – ideally – a coastal location for higher snow quantities and a more stable snowpack.Gasser had spent plenty of time guiding clients in the Russian Caucasus, as well as in Uzbekistan, India, Canada, Alaska and across Europe. A new frontier for heli-skiing was also on the list.Poring over the maps, Gasser and Italian guiding friend Danilo Garin realised that the 75-mile (121 kilometer) chain of the Kaçkar range, near Turkey’s border with Georgia, seemed to tick all the boxes.In the summer of 2002, Gasser spent a month on the ground in the area, hiking the valleys, assessing the local facilities and flying over the mountains – the highest of which is Kaçkar Dagi at over 13,000 feet (3,962 meters).“The shape of the mountains is perfect for heli-skiing,” says Gasser, who is based in Verbier during winter. “In every valley it’s possible to do more than 50 runs if you want and it’s very close to the base – less than five minutes flying. For the guests, it’s perfect.”He zeroed in on the small resort of Ayder, a traditional “yayla” or summer highland pasture village, with wooden pitch-roof houses and barns, surrounded by pine forests and waterfalls.The village – in a lush, narrow valley carved by the Firtina river – is popular in summer with regional tourists and visitors from the Middle East with activities such as hot springs, rafting and hiking.In winter, moist air from the Black Sea mixes with cold mountain air to produce plentiful powder snow at altitude from January to April.“It’s just epic skiing,” says Oliver Evans of Elemental Adventure, a London-based heli-skiing agency which organizes trips for small groups and private clients to more than a dozen exotic mountain locations worldwide.“You just don’t realize you’ve got this Canadian-style heli-skiing right on the doorstep of Europe.“You’ve got these little villages up there which are abandoned in the wintertime with deep snow on the roofs, and mosques. It’s quite exotic to wake up in the morning and hear the call to prayer going on outside the hotel. It’s the last place you expect to be skiing.”Gasser ran his first trips from Ayder in 2005 with one helicopter, rented from Air Zermatt in Switzerland.“They opened the road and opened one hotel just for us,” said Gasser.“We were alone in this village. Now at the weekend plenty of people come there to see the snow, to play in the snow with sledges or with tubing, light a fire or have a barbecue on the snow, with singing and dancing. But when we started, nobody was there in the winter.”Bureaucracy forced Gasser to shut down the operation after a few years, but he remained eager to return and was able to reopen in 2018, with exclusive access to a nearly 2,000 square mile tenure – enough to fit in a large chunk of the French Alps and some of Italy – reserved for about 20 skiers per week.In January 2023, with snow in the European Alps thin on the ground and expectations low, Evans flew out to Istanbul and then made the short hop to local airport Rize, just an hour’s drive from Ayder, to run a trip for clients. Trabzon is another regional airport option, two hours’ drive away.The first day, he says, it was “absolutely dumping.” He took some clients up through the forest in a snowcat to do some avalanche rescue training and assess their ability, skiing back down to the village via a tiny trackside café for a cup of local Turkish tea.“You’re skiing past, and all these people are looking at you like you’ve come from Mars, they’re not particularly familiar with seeing people skiing there,” says Evans.The following morning the weather had cleared and Evans, one of the clients, and guides Georg and Yann clambered into the helicopter sitting right outside their hotel base, the three-star Hasimoglu in Ayder.Swiss pilot Dany eased the machine above the frosted trees and out of the valley, opening up a dazzling vista of pristine peaks with the Black Sea glimmering to the north. Minutes later he dropped them at the top of a slope nicknamed Home Run.“It was a bluebird, not a cloud in the sky, cold, 70-80 centimeters [28-31 inches] of new snow on the base. Just unbelievable,” says Evans.They waited for the storm of the blades and the wop-wop-wop sound of the heli to disappear. There was a moment’s silence to savor the beckoning slopes beneath them before the guides calmly outlined the plan. None of the frenzy of a resort powder day up here.“My first turns of the winter and it was thigh-to-waist, light, proper cold-smoke powder,” says Evans.“The client and I were both giggling like school kids, we just could not believe our luck to have scored it this big on the first day of the season. You could tell even the guides were thinking that this was off the charts.“There was a lot of whooping and high-fiving going on, it was pretty American. In the first hour and a half I probably skied more untracked powder than I had in the last 10 years.”After a morning dancing through feathers, they touched down on a ridge for lunch and munched on sandwiches, hot soup, chocolate, fruit and nuts, plus tea, coffee and drinks from the helicopter cool box.“We were outside this little deserted village with snow folding over the roofs of these little shepherd huts, and the minaret of the mosque just to remind you that you’re in Turkey and not British Columbia,” says Evans. “It was probably my best day’s skiing ever.”The average run in Ayder is about 900 vertical meters (nearly 3,000 feet) and clients can expect to ski about about 11-15 runs per day. Professionalism and safety are paramount, and the guides are constantly monitoring the avalanche risk.“There is a misconception about heli-skiing that it’s quite extreme but on the whole, it isn’t,” says Evans. “You’re not jumping out of helicopters; you’re stepping out of them very carefully, slowly and deliberately. There is a saying, ‘slow is fast’. There are a few women doing it but there’s no reason there couldn’t be more.”Apres ski at the Hasimoglu, which was refurbished in 2016, is generally low key.Guests relax in spring-fed hot baths, sip Turkish coffee or drinks from the bar, play table tennis or visit the on-site masseurs.Dinner is buffet style with plenty of salads, humus, pitta, falafel, kofte, aubergine, tomatoes and grilled meats. Local specialities include hamsi kusu, a dish of Black Sea anchovies, or muhlama, made of corn flour, butter and cheese.Gasser’s rotating line-up of guides come from all corners of the globe: Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada, USA. With the local Turkish staff, it makes for a cosmopolitan mix.“The Turkish people are very nice, welcoming, very open, they help us a lot, it’s a big pleasure to work with them,” he says.On bad weather days, alternative activities include skiing from the snowcat, snow shoeing or ski touring. Guests can visit a tea plantation, honey-makers and craft centers, or relax in local restaurants.When famed American snowboarder Jeremy Jones was a guest, some of the locals revealed they had been riding around the village for more than 60 years on old wooden boards, with rope handles and a stick to steer.“Maybe snowboarding started there, in a small village in the Kaçkar mountains, not in the USA,” laughs Gasser. “It’s a great story.”Progress is in the air in Ayder, and the Turkish government is exploring projects to develop a proper resort with ski lifts. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who hails from Rize, even visited the region in 2020 to promote winter tourism.The Kaçkar mountains could soon be on the world ski map, and not just for heli-skiing.“We will be very happy if, one day, there is a ski resort in Ayder,” says Gasser.",8720,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/turkey-heliski/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231102145834-01-turkey-secret-ski-scene.jpg?c=original&q=h_618,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,vista peak northeast sip barn carve helicopter café nice mountain buffet austria plane barbecue project develop bluebird great valley jet start hot india danilo speciality constantly river exclusive village shut mile deliberately frost moment skier sandwich possible caucasus believe big nickname progress bureaucracy government flour ridge touch snowboarder adventure shoe ski erdoğan pine outline knew zeroed follow welcome fire closer tower window back usa drop powder low slowly untracked weather access center past rescue lunch luck exotic green tree explore realise close guide thin rize trabzon silence ease open nut airport beneath abandon georg foot frenzy produce cloud future deep bar relax facility italian snow storm plan savor fruit skiing dany work canada half rid snowboard snowcat proximity trip popular chain rotate pitta short chunk include priceless butter proper famed average high play assess peer switzerland january falafel tayyip hour call friend staff border verbier spent ground president stable machine tea tour tiny fit location doorstep range lot moist shape fold month air lush rope shepherd option sweden avoid dagi desert calmly operator realize highland tourist huge remind seat carefully run middle school oliver dazzle reopen area time morning season centimeter perfect alaska turn ran ability pleasure apres edge southern visit north europe clear disappear traditional local white alp flew recep firtina coffee step eager pilot chocolate cool place hamsi istanbul dish sledge spring alternative stretch british ideally clamber black russian set spot reveal thierry drive pristine activity refurbish minute meter muhlama coastal hop dance munch drink slow particularly cold kid cnn winter woman unbelievable european forest absolutely summer happy light trackside wait bath minaret small epic craft meat heli extreme prayer french intrigue jumping ayder american blue frontier map guest plantation regional group base tenure plentiful rent glimmer zealand corn cosmopolitan home paramount large board square table elemental business expect generally training hail humus check familiar hut yayla wooden style region reason reserve promote hasimoglu operation probably jones inch salad mosque jeremy laugh sound opening top vertical tick sky quantity blade soup corner tomato cup lookout mix avalanche handle turkey shin resort organizes roof professionalism pasture plenty criterion anchovy private hear misconception world fast sing day kyrgyzstan year house force east raft hike evans safety france visitor kofte ass aubergine columbia surround garin narrow italy stick kusu wintertime beckoning tennis whoop slope lift wake tube lag fly weekend agency germany destination dozen kaçkar expectation remain grill georgia return feather yann kilometer client monitoring zermatt altitude score uzbekistan giggle pretty gasser road make globe turkish,0.99715,0.1032110091743119,7.697094594594592,0.4363621538279071,0,2023-11-10
CNN,Tracy Chapman wins CMA Award for ‘Fast Car’ decades after song’s debut,2023-11-09 14:14:00,Alli Rosenbloom,"Tracy Chapman continues to make history with her 1988 hit “Fast Car” after winning song of the year at Wednesday’s Country Music Awards.Chapman was not present during the telecast, which took place at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena, but country star and the category’s presenter Sarah Evans read a message on Chapman’s behalf after announcing her as the winner.“I’m sorry I couldn’t join you all tonight. It’s truly an honor for my song to be newly recognized after 35 years of its debut. Wow. Thank you to the CMAs and a special thanks to Luke (Combs) and to all of the fans of ‘Fast Car,’” Evans said on behalf of Chapman.The CMA win is a remarkable achievement given “Fast Car” debuted 35 years ago, and saw a resurgence in popularity in July after country star Luke Combs released a cover of the hit single.Combs’ cover went on to reach No. 1 on the Country Airplay chart, making Chapman the first Black woman to top the chart since it came into existence in 1990.Chapman, who is the sole writer of “Fast Car,” also reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Country Songwriters chart, thanks to the Combs cover.“I never expected to find myself on the country charts, but I’m honored to be there,” Chapman told Billboard in a statement at the time, adding, “I’m happy for Luke and his success and grateful that new fans have found and embraced ‘Fast Car.’”Combs also took home a CMA Award on Wednesday for his cover of “Fast Car” in the single of the year category.“Fast Car” was the first single off Chapman’s self-titled debut album, and it earned her a Grammy in 1989 for best female pop vocal performance as well as record and song of the year nominations.She also won for best new artist and best contemporary folk album that year.The CMAs aired on ABC on Wednesday and were hosted by country singer Luke Bryan and former football player Peyton Manning.CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.",1900,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/08/entertainment/tracy-chapman-fast-car-cma/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231109094744-01-musician-tracy-chapman-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,tonight expect grateful debut single find nashville writer luke place sarah car popularity earn arena pop sorry former award contemporary wow vocal top black songwriter embrace behalf july newly comb reach found cma airplay respers achievement told honor contribute continue billboard artist song telecast fast bridgestone album woman air read year resurgence category player football bryan happy win wednesday evans france give ago existence present host announce statement remarkable tracy cmas chart cover peyton chapman abc country time lisa star success female hit special sole singer message music record presenter home recognize join make report performance release grammy add history folk,0.9943,0.1578947368421052,6.778553615960099,0.4457491582491582,0,2023-11-09
CNN,"Near the remains of South Korea’s largest mountain fortress, the country’s sole makgeolli master keeps a dying art alive",2023-11-08 22:51:00,Maggie Hiufu Wong,"On scenic Geumjeong Mountain on the edge of Busan, South Korea’s second biggest city, lies the remains of what was once the country’s largest mountain fortress.Though now in ruins, this former bastion’s connection to the local community lives on in a nearby village brewery that has been making a unique alcoholic beverage for hundreds of years – makgeolli.Best described as fermented rice wine, the drink has it’s been experiencing a resurgence in popularity in recent years. However, newer and more premium makgeolli brands are usually sweeter and lighter – and younger drinkers have grown accustomed to their taste.The traditional makgeolli brewed on the mountain – referred to as Geumjeongsanseong, which translates to “golden spring mountain fortress” – is sourer, tarter and thicker than its modern counterparts.“Our Geumjeongsanseong Makgeolli is the drink that shares the hardship of the local people,” says Yoo Cheong-gil, the sixth-generation owner of the brewery and the only officially recognized makgeolli master in South Korea.“Many young people taste ours and are surprised by the flavor because they have never tasted the traditional makgeolli made by old wives.”The Geumjeongsan Fortress that visitors experience today was built in the 1700s, but other structures were constructed and fortified in its place for centuries before that.Throughout history, builders tasked with working on the site would drink the local makgeolli during their breaks. Loving the distinctive flavors, they spread the word about this special version of the milky alcoholic beverage when they traveled home after the job was complete.That’s how Geumjeongsanseong Makgeolli became a nationwide delicacy and South Korea’s only designated “Traditional Folk Wine.”Yoo’s family has been making this special makgeolli for more than five centuries. He says the magic of its uniqueness lies in its nuruk (Korean yeast cake).“This is truly a treasure,” says Yoo, holding a perfectly round and flat piece of nuruk, which resembles baked pizza dough.“This is what a good nuruk looks like. Look here for the yellow yeast, look closely and you will see white and black yeast. They are varied. A good nuruk has all these yeasts together.”To make nuruk, dried wheat is mixed with warm water. Then, the resulting dough is wrapped in a cloth and repeatedly stepped on. This takes place for a few minutes until the nuruk is round, flat and thick around the edges.“The edges are thick so it can hold moisture for longer,” says Yoo.“Yeast loves moisture. The thick edge is what allows an even spread of yeast all the way to the thin center. This is the long handed-down wisdom. Hundreds of years of trial and error led to this ideal method.”The flattened nuruk is placed in the fermentation room so natural yeast can land on it and “flower.” The fermented nuruk is then dried outside under the sunlight for two to three days, with UV light killing unwanted fungus in the process.Finally, the flowered and sunbathed nuruk is left in a storage space to ferment for 30-45 days.Once ready, the nuruk – which at this stage is brownish and crumbly – is broken down into small bits and mixed with steamed sticky rice and water to brew the actual makgeolli.The result? A beverage that captures the flavors of the terroir: the distinctive yeasts in the air of the shielded Sanseong Valley, with its clean water and high altitude.Geumjeongsanseong Makgeolli is the only brewery in the country that makes its nuruk using these traditional methods.“That’s why if I stop, a part of our culture will completely fade,” says Yoo.Most modern makgeolli brewers use machine-pressed nuruk, and the yeast is added manually.“But the machine-made nuruk is completely different from ours. They are just white all over. They can’t ‘flower’ because the yeast is not in the dough. Theirs is completely different in flavor and smell,” says Yoo.Geumjeongsanseong Makgeolli’s nuruk-making team consists of five women, each having five decades of experience stepping on nuruk dough.“Since I was a child, each family in this town brewed their drinks. Making sticky rice, mixing it with nuruk, and pouring it into a clay pot: These are things I saw from the moment I cracked my eyes open as a baby,” says Yoo.He remembers helping his grandmother work with nuruk as she kneaded the dough, meanwhile learning the brewing process by watching his mother make makgeolli.“This drink is my family. Their life itself,” says Yoo, who took over the family craft about three decades ago.Today, his son and nephew work alongside him.Yoo thinks it is important for his family to continue to preserve the traditional tastes of makgeolli so customers can enjoy it in its original form. It’s also why he insists on keeping makgeolli affordable, despite the labor-intensive brewing process, so it’s accessible to everyone.“I personally think the premium makgeolli makers are too consumed by consumerism. The regular makgeolli is the drink of the people so this drink that I make here needs to accommodate regular people’s taste. That’s how we preserve the flavor,” says Yoo.“Then they say we are falling behind on times. They tell us to change according to the contemporary taste. But that will make the tradition disappear. There are people who experiment and make creative makgeolli for young people. I think we need both us and them.”Geumjeongsanseong Makgeolli produces around 5,000 to 6,000 bottles per day. Each of the 750ml bottles is priced at KRW3,000 ($2.2).As for how the traditional beverage should be enjoyed, Yoo says this is not the time to sip.“You need to gulp it down from a bowl,” he says.“Drink the whole bowl in a single motion – that’s the best way. Drinking it on a rainy day is extra delicious. Traditional makgeolli has some sourness. When it’s humid from rain it goes well with that acidity. That’s why it is ideal to pair it with deep-fried food on a humid day.”For instance, many locals love to pair makgeolli and crispy scallion jeon (pancakes), he says.In addition to the nuruk fermentation room and a separate brewing room, the brewery also has an exhibition room showcasing the family’s collection of makgeolli-making equipment and offers brewing classes for visitors.Although you can find Geumjeongsanseong’s yellow-labeled makgeolli outside Busan, Yoo thinks people should still take the time to visit Geumjeong Mountain for a truly authentic taste of the drink.“It can taste different when you drink it here or have it somewhere else; because we don’t pasteurize the makgeolli, it continues to ferment after it’s shipped,” he says.“They are sensitive to temperature. They breathe.

CNN,Russian manufacturer test-flies prototype widebody passenger airplane,2023-11-08 12:07:00,Barry Neild,"Russia’s leading aircraft manufacturer says it’s completed a successful test flight of a new widebody passenger airplane that it claims could replace Western aircraft in the country’s skies.The United Aircraft Corporation said a prototype of its IL-96-400M long-haul airplane has taken off for the first time on a flight that lasted 26 minutes and reached altitudes of up to 2,000 meters (6,562 feet) and speeds of up to 390 kilometers per hour (242 mph), according to a news release posted by the company last week.UAC, which oversees Russian aviation brands including Tupolev, Ilyushin and Sukhoi, said the plane will be capable of carrying up to 370 passengers, a capacity that would put it alongside the likes of Airbus’ A340 or Boeing’s 777.It said the airplane marked a step up from the previous IL-96-300 aircraft, production of which reportedly halted more than a decade ago because it was unable to compete with Western models.“The first and successful flight of the modernized IL-96-400M is a demonstration of the highest level of competence of domestic aircraft manufacturers,” Russia’s deputy prime minister, Denis Manturov, said in the release.According to UAC, the IL-96-400M can be configured in up to three passenger classes and will be installed with a “modern infotainment system” offering internet, TV and satellite communications. It will also be equipped with a “modern” kitchen.The new airplane, which was photographed midair decorated in UAC corporate colors, could be seen as a public relations win for Russia at a time when its domestic aviation industry is creaking under pressure of Western sanctions imposed because of its invasion of Ukraine.US and European sanctions on leasing planes to Russia led to that country losing nearly 10% of commercial aircraft before President Vladimir Putin enacted laws allowing Russian airlines to seize leased aircraft and re-register them domestically.But with limited access to parts for planes made by Boeing, Airbus and other Western manufacturers like Bombardier and Embraer, experts say keeping fleets airworthy will be increasingly difficult. As of 2022, only 144 active Russian airline planes were built in Russia, according to data provided by aviation analytics firm Cirium.“Although Moscow won’t admit it, the sanctions that followed the Ukraine invasion have really damaged Russian aviation,” Murdo Morrison, head of strategic content at FlightGlobal, tells CNN.“The problem is that lack of spares – some get in through the back door undoubtedly – means that many Airbus and Boeing aircraft flying in Russia today are potentially dangerous. Although Russia has a proficient regulator, there is very little visibility as to the health of its fleet.”In September, an Airbus A320 operated by Ural Airlines, reportedly one of the leased aircraft appropriated by Russia, was forced to make an emergency landing in a field in Russia’s Novosibirsk region due to what was provisionally claimed to have been a midair failure of its hydraulic system.Last year, a safety audit by the International Civil Aviation Organization resulted in Russia being marked with a “red flag” indicating insufficient regulatory oversight – a status shared by only three other countries – Bhutan, Congo and Liberia.Addressing concerns, Russia’s Ministry of Transport said at the time that flight safety on Russia-operated aircraft meets international standards.UAC’s release said the new IL-96-400M’s safety and reliability was comparable to the “world’s best models due to the redundancy of the aircraft’s systems and its aerodynamic configuration.”The manufacturer also said it would meet international regulatory requirements.Yuri Slyusar, UAC’s general director, was quoted in the release saying it would, alongside other Russian-built aircraft, be deployed across the country’s aviation network and “replace foreign analogues.”FlightGlobal’s Morrison says that while the aircraft may be reliable, they will be significantly inferior to their Western counterparts and are unlikely to be manufactured in the quantities once seen under Soviet rule.“Trying to restore Russia’s pre-1990 aerospace industry is a massive gamble. In fact, it will lose the state billions, although Moscow probably accepts that the political price is worth paying, and, besides, it hasn’t any choice.”",4326,https://www.cnn.com/travel/russia-test-flies-new-homegrown-widebody-passenger-airplane/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/uac-ul-69-400m-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,airworthy unable limited satellite reportedly step airplane successful pressure prime midair pay domestic plane impose regulatory restore test potentially concern aerodynamic appropriate operate tupolev russian september competence ukraine airline denis ministry airbus congo deployed minute corporate transport comparable photograph meter flightglobal creak embraer health decade communication european difficult manufacture configure ago sanction seize significantly murdo follow status meet back sukhoi internet mph foreign put dangerous speed oversight claim country access class indicate uac minister part color vladimir manufacturer redundancy provisionally price marked decorate political oversees field slyusar foot release company model expert analytics ural gamble due fleet lose problem tv land capacity result moscow hydraulic carry failure passenger infotainment region instal halt public include probably worth network post fact choice civil deputy western law compete high complete accord lease flag invasion system general quantity hour brand red reach level russia lack prototype relation news director lead international audit president modernize widebody bhutan claimed undoubtedly world content soviet firm putin increasingly industry share billion insufficient emergency aerospace flight year morrison force enact counterpart production quote win safety replace massive united admit spare today alongside demonstration active head equip fly proficient inferior manturov strategic damage boeing time provide offering aircraft regulator kilometer modern data bombardier altitude corporation reliability visibility commercial built ilyushin capable novosibirsk previous aviation accepts make organization reliable state,0.2944,0.1386962552011095,12.304010484927913,0.3285422249707964,0,2023-11-08
CNN,Striking actors say they have responded to Hollywood and TV studios’ ‘best and final offer’,2023-11-07 04:42:00,Ramishah Maruf,"SAG-AFTRA said it has responded to Hollywood studios’ “last, best & final offer” on Monday as pressure ramps up to reach a deal ending the industry-freezing strike.The actors’ union said in a message to its members that there are several “essential items” that the two sides have yet to reach agreement on, such as the use of AI.The union said every member of its negotiating committee “is determined to secure the right deal and thereby bring this strike to an end responsibly.”On Saturday, the union said it had received and was reviewing the proposal from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which it described as its “Last, Best, and Final Offer.”AMPTP members include Disney, Netflix, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery. Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN.It’s still not clear when a deal to end the nearly four-month-long strike will be reached, but the standoff has taken on heightened urgency in recent days as the two sides work to resolve the standoff in time to salvage the remainder of the winter television season.SAG-AFTRA, which represents about 160,000 actors, announced its members would walk off sets on July 14, joining the striking writers in a historic double walkout against the studios. Both unions have advocated for restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence, a technology that actors and writers alike believe poses an existential threat to their livelihoods.Members of the Writers Guild of America union ratified a new contract with Hollywood and television studios in early October. It included assurances that AI cannot write or rewrite literary material and will require AI-generated materials to be disclosed to writers.Despite the anticipation for a deal, 5,000 SAG-AFTRA members signed an online petition urging a hard line in negotiations toward a final agreement, saying they would not agree to a deal that did not meet the demands laid out at the start of the strike.– CNN’s David Goldman contributed to this story.",2003,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/06/media/sag-aftra-respond-best-and-final-offer/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231105105955-02-sag-aftra-picket-1103.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,offer discovery member double literary secure represent pressure contract work walkout motion writer online line remainder netflix petition warner demand negotiation agreement hard include review start amptp advocate alliance material parent described resolve proposal july bros reach actor set technology television guild intelligence laid contribute nbcuniversal item picture rewrite restriction urgency union believe walk day determine sign side winter require cnn pose assurance respond bring hollywood historic story threat studio existential salvage write early america essential ramp disney heighten announce meet goldman anticipation recent october monday time deal ratify artificial agree disclose message urge producer join saturday final alike david company clear committee strike standoff negotiate receive,0.8798999999999999,0.0,11.104598337950137,0.4436913780663781,0,2023-11-07
CNN,Priscilla Presley reveals why she never remarried after Elvis,2023-11-06 12:27:00,Marianne Garvey,"Priscilla Presley is talking about why she never remarried after her six-year marriage to Elvis Presley ended.During a Q&A event at the South Point Casino in Las Vegas on Friday, Presley told the crowd she just felt like she could not be married again, according to People.“I just don’t think that he could handle that,” she said of her late ex husband, who died in 1977.“To be honest with you, I never wanted to marry after him. I never had any desire,” she added. “No one could ever match him.”The two were married from 1967 to 1973. They new Sofia Coppola directed film “Priscilla” explores how the former couple met and became friends in Germany in 1959, when Presley was 14 and Elvis was 24, before they later married.Presley also discussed their daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who was born in 1968, saying the singer had feelings of guilt over not being around enough.“Elvis felt he had a very busy schedule and he did have a bit of guilt that he wasn’t around that much when Lisa was younger,” she said, adding, “With his scheduling and his touring, he just felt he wasn’t around enough to give a lot of attention to having another child.”",1145,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/06/entertainment/priscilla-presley-reveals-why-she-never-remarried-after-elvis/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231106112731-01-priscilla-presley-090423-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,direct desire young event bit friday match priscilla give born discuss felt schedule explores talk south germany marry feeling accord elvis former marie busy child crowd lisa coppola attention singer sofia vega film husband friend late handle told guilt casino daughter presley marriage married remarry tour honest add lot point couple,0.54785,0.7860262008733624,6.1455870445344125,0.3370454545454546,0,2023-11-06
CNN,"In Sofia Coppola’s ‘Priscilla,’ clothes are an ‘armor and identity’",2023-11-03 14:23:00,Leah Dolan,"Before Kim and Kanye or even Posh and Becks, there was Priscilla and Elvis Presley: A fashion-forward couple whose tumultuous relationship is still remembered for its distinctive style as much as anything else.Priscilla was just 14 years old when she was first introduced to 24-year-old Elvis during a party in his house in Bad Nauheim, Germany, where the superstar was completing military service in 1959. They remained a couple for over a decade, and later started a family together, before their divorce in 1973.There was the surprise Las Vegas wedding in 1967, featuring Priscilla’ pearl-embellished white shift dress, complete with a 3-foot-long tulle veil, as well as Elvis’ custom black paisley tuxedo. Or one of their rare family portraits taken in 1970, a carefully-posed shot dominated by the pair’s imposing outfits (Elvis in a two-toned blue taffeta suit and exaggerated high collar, Priscilla wearing a lilac shirred puff-sleeve shirt and matching purple trousers). Even their 2-year-old daughter Lisa Marie got a costume change, photographed in both a polka dot summer dress as well as a miniature white fur coat during the shoot.For costume designer Stacey Battat, these moments were key historical anchors when outfitting director Sofia Coppola’s latest film “Priscilla” — a candy-colored biopic mapping the couple’s private life, starring Jacob Elordi as Elvis and newcomer Cailee Spaeny in the titular role.“That’s how we started, and then we filled in the blanks,” said Battat over a video call from Los Angeles. “We looked at magazines and other references to pull together what those middle looks would be — the pieces between those benchmarks, so we had a clean timeline that didn’t feel abrupt.” (Priscilla herself, though credited as an executive producer on the movie, was largely hands-off in the costume department.)Battat, who previously worked with Coppola on “The Bling Ring” (2013) and “The Beguiled” (2017), was bound by the strict budgetary constraints typical of independent filmmaking, as well as a tight 30-day-shoot schedule. This meant no resource went to waste: On occasion, pieces were shared between characters, and Coppola’s connections in the fashion industry were taken full advantage of.Chanel designed and produced the recreation of Priscilla’s wedding gown; Coppola has been a brand ambassador for the French fashion house since 2019, and even interned there as a teen in 1986. Many of Elvis’ looks came directly from Valentino — specifically the star’s iconic knitwear pieces (replicas of the funnel-neck cable knit sweater he wore in the 1957 film “Jailhouse Rock” are still sold today).“It was the greatest gift the movie could have gotten,” said Battat of the collaboration. “Any costume designer will tell you making knits is a difficult task. Asking a few handknitters to make 10 sweaters in a six-week period is not happening.” Instead, Battat sent reference photos and a color palette to the Valentino design team, who created a mini collection for the film. “It was super nice to work with people that are so creative, and also have the finished product be these amazing, beautiful clothes… I swear, anytime someone was stressed out they would pet the sweaters.”In “Priscilla,” the couple’s sprawling wardrobes and shared interest in image-making is front and center. Clothes were, for them, intentional and calculated. After the birth of Lisa Marie in 1968, Priscilla greeted paparazzi like royalty, dressed in a hot pink wool collared shift dress and a full face of makeup, for example, not a hair out of place from her black beehive. The zany, rhinestone jumpsuits Elvis wore in the early-1970s, meanwhile, were a strategic move to capture a new audience, reinstate his capability as a performer and distance himself with the stiff suits of the previous decade. “He’s trying to change his image,” said Battat. “Clothes are their armor and their identity.”But power dressing isn’t always as easy as it looks. Through Coppola’s lens, we see a slightly sheepish Elvis during a jumpsuit fitting confiding in Priscilla that he “feels silly.” But his wife — newly thrust into the public eye and keenly aware herself of the insecurity clothes can evoke — assures him that he looks great.Dress is one of the first ways we see the cracks in Priscilla and Elvis’ relationship, too. With her film based on Priscilla’s 1985 autobiography, “Elvis and Me,” Coppola shows how much influence the pop icon wielded over his young wife — and her image. After Priscilla, still a schoolgirl, moves into Graceland, she’s given a makeover. In a department store dressing room, Elvis and his entourage sit and watch her cycle through shift dresses and matching sets. She admires a chocolate-hued frock, but is overridden immediately. “I hate brown,” the King quips. “It reminds me of the army.” Subtle steers (“You’re a small girl, stay away from the prints, baby”), suggestions and a few down-right demands (“Black hair and more eye makeup”) quickly remove any autonomy Priscilla once had over her appearance.Costumes for Coppola — who has built a career capturing the agony and ecstasy of young women navigating sexuality and power amid the throes of first love — are tools which can communicate complicated emotional landscapes. In her 1999 directorial debut “The Virgin Suicides,” the character Lux Lisbon defaces her underwear with her crush’s name, concealing the evidence underneath the smothering, sexless nightgown mandated by her puritanical mother. One of the most emotional scenes in 2006’s “Marie Antoinette”is when the 14-year-old soon-to-be Queen is taken over the Austrian border into France and forced, in the middle of the woods, to strip out of her country’s clothes and adopt the fashions of Versailles.In “Priscilla,” Elordi and Spaeny worked with Battat to flesh out the psychological factors driving each character’s aesthetic. “They were very collaborative,” she said of the actors. “Cailee asked me, ‘When Priscilla is feeling insecure about Ann-Margret, do you think that changes the way she dresses?’” (A Golden Age film starlet, Ann-Margret appeared with Elvis in the 1964 movie “Viva Las Vegas.” The pair were widely-rumored to have had an affair.) “And I was like, ‘Actually, it probably does. Because she’s so interested in pleasing him, maybe she would want to model herself after Ann-Margret.’”Battat then found a pink dress similar to one worn in an archival photo taken of the actor. It appears in the movie during a scene when Priscilla is torturing herself with latest gossip on her husband. On the cover of one tabloid is a picture of Ann-Margret and Elvis in a tight embrace. Priscilla, in a pink dress and sitting cross-legged on the sofa, pores over the magazine, dressed as an imitation of the other woman. “No one will know that’s Ann-Margret’s pink dress,” said Battat. “But it’s for us.”",6867,https://www.cnn.com/style/priscilla-elvis-sofia-coppola-film-costumes/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/d-10208rt.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,divorce meant power wedding wardrobe white newcomer sell navigate custom confide golden starlet steer filmmaking insecurity instead dress store constraint nice wool pink place impose super historical demand collaborative rare executive typical mini great distance capability icon start exaggerated elordi design reinstate pop hot shift stay aware elvis marie benchmark coat finish dominate period complicate black introduce set designer found drive sexless nauheim bling worn fashion moment movie lilac picture family photograph hate stiff brown scene throe tool full image purple overridden sexuality landscape create queen woman decade ring subtle royalty quickly suit print feel difficult summer frock valentino costume directorial blank give strict budgetary audience smother small schoolgirl fill trouser veil jumpsuit specifically superstar pore anchor autonomy french replica beautiful front cover slightly lux intentional evoke aesthetic rhinestone tuxedo blue mapping wear lisbon country team center amid portrait star independent tumultuous tight underneath color posh kanye beck sofa sofia base vega film jailhouse department outfit crush zany makeup fur wood emotional underwear gown produce reminds birth model iconic knitwear recreation watch dot archival pull factor directly debut influence collaboration move ambassador taffeta magazine rock anytime spaeny intern psychological work match style easy surprise similar polka baby cailee tulle public service puritanical hair king probably clean pair task sprawl girl high complete wore eye strip affair graceland embrace brand call newly quip mother actor coppola autobiography interested gossip cycle career husband room timeline director wife border key lens presley stacey away collar titular evidence insecure collection sheepish virgin reference private photo crack adopt couple paisley paparazzo battat shirt age party creative share industry military young life imitation year shirr defaces change waste admires mandate house force feature keenly shot france largely priscilla remove beguile agony suicide tabloid suggestion assures thrust immediately swear schedule knit today greet beehive ecstasy viva jacob nightgown antoinette occasion austrian strategic capture remember amaze credit relationship germany fitting resource armor middle angeles sweater remain distinctive previously video communicate advantage lisa entourage flesh torture miniature connection calculate clothes performer interest gift stress show late biopic producer palette makeover cable character daughter built previous conceal wield make product handknitters bound piece love,0.9818,0.0,8.564922164566344,0.4422002635046111,0,2023-11-03
CNN,Keith Lee tried to review some Atlanta restaurants on TikTok. All hell broke loose,2023-11-02 11:39:00,not specified,"Most restaurants are usually thrilled to have Keith Lee review their food.With more than 14.5 million followers on TikTok alone, Lee brings exposure that has helped turn some businesses around, with lines out the door and praise from grateful owners.Then Lee came to Atlanta.His visit brought viral videos, death threats, responses from Grammy-winning artists and what some say is a long overdue reckoning for the Atlanta restaurant scene.Lee is a 27-year-old former MMA fighter who has found so much fame reviewing eateries that it’s now a full-time gig.Unlike some food influencers who get paid for their reviews and opinions, Lee says in his videos that he pays for his own meals and even sends family members to pick up his orders so he’s not recognized and given special treatment.The everyman reviewer, who lives in Las Vegas, has a trademark style: He eats the food in his vehicle and records his reactions, while always encouraging his followers to not go by his experience alone and to try out the establishments themselves.Lee also tries to dissuade his followers from being negative on social media towards the businesses whose food he hasn’t rated highly, often pointing out that any company can have a bad day and to bear in mind that people depend on their business for their livelihood.His focus on small businesses and food trucks — often Black owned — has endeared him to the eatery owners who have gotten good reviews. Having him taste your food is referred to online as being “Keith Lee-d.”So there was initially a sense of excitement when Lee’s followers discovered he was visiting Atlanta as part of a food tour he and his family have undertaken across the country.In recent years Atlanta has become a culinary hotspot, with multiple “Top Chef” contestants and several celebrity-owned restaurants. The city even recently scored its first Michelin-star restaurants.Mike Jordan has been covering the Atlanta culinary scene since 2009 and told CNN the city is a natural spot for the industry to thrive given that in Georgia “we eat everywhere we go.”“I mean, gas station food is big in the South, and Atlanta strip clubs have not just food, but very good food,” Jordan said. “I remember when people used to say, ‘Oh my gosh, why would you ever eat at a strip club?’ And we’ve gone to the point of now it is a well acknowledged thing that Magic City (a legendary strip club in Atlanta) has very, very, very good wings.”But when Lee started trying to get food from some Atlanta-area eateries, things didn’t go so well.Lee initially agreed to be interviewed by CNN and then changed his mind, requesting that some of the establishments he visited be given the opportunity to speak instead. But on his social platforms — he has another 1 million-plus followers on Instagram — he shared a story saying he was unable to get service at The Real Milk and Honey in College Park, a community south of Atlanta.According to his review, when Lee’s family tried to order food the staff told them the restaurant was closing early for a deep cleaning — despite the doors being open wide and other customers picking up orders.Lee said he opted to go in himself and when the staff recognized him, they offered him service, which he declined.“I pay for my food like everybody else. I walk up in spots like everybody else,” Lee said, explaining why he was doing a food-less review. “We are all normal people. Respectfully, if you’re not going to do it then, don’t do it now.”Lee said he believes he also received special treatment when he attempted to try the food at Old Lady Gang, an Atlanta restaurant owned by Grammy-winning songwriter, singer and “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Kandi Burruss.Lee said he sent his family into the eatery and they were told there was no carryout on the weekends and it would be a wait of more than an hour. But Lee added that once again he went inside, was recognized and then told they could be seated right away.The TikTok creator said that when he asked how his group could suddenly be seated so quickly he was told that the people on the list ahead of his family had not responded when their name was called, creating an opening. Again, he declined service.The two businesses had different responses to the attempted reviews.The Real Milk and Honey initially posted a video on social media in which an unidentified man asks, “Who is this Keith Lee?” The video was met with almost immediate backlash and was deleted.The restaurant then posted a statement on its Instagram account to “address a recent incident that highlighted a review from a high profile food blogger.”“In no way were we trying to discredit anyone, if the comments came across as such, kindly accept our apologies,” the statement reads. “It’s crucial to always take feedback and make improvements, for the success of our business and our community.”For her part, Burruss posted a video on her Instagram account saying, “I just really want to say, I do appreciate Keith Lee for stopping by our restaurant and trying to show us love.”“It is very unfortunate that we couldn’t serve him and his family,” she said. “On the weekends, we get a lot of community support, people in our city that show up for us, as well as a lot of people from out of town. So, with that being said, we don’t want to overwhelm our kitchen by having to, you know, have such long times for the people who are actually at the restaurant, plus having to do to-go orders.”CNN has reached out to both The Real Milk and Honey and Burruss for additional comment.Lee’s experiences have stirred some on social media to share their own complaints, among them that Atlanta’s restaurant scene is littered with places that care more about their social media presentation than their food and service.Such spots have inconsistent hours, food and customer service, along with policies that are not always customer friendly — such as not allowing takeout, according to many complaints.The conversation went so viral that rapper Cardi B, who has a home in Atlanta, went live on social media and shared her own experiences, saying “I feel like Atlanta restaurants, they don’t like to make money,” and noting that she has sometimes had members of her team drop her name in an effort to get better service.“I feel bad for Atlanta residents,” she said. “Thank you, Jesus, I’m famous, but even me being famous, it’s like a hassle!”But Jordan, who is now a senior editor for the Black culture team at Atlanta’s newspaper of record, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, sees positives in what happened.“I think sometimes it takes an outsider to vocalize what is on a lot of people’s minds. And the fact that when he did this, there was such a viral reaction across the board from diners, from influencers, from the media, from the restaurant owners — that just shows you that this has really been bubbling under the surface for a long time,” Jordan said.“And he (Lee) was just the conduit to really open up this conversation,” he added. “I think his outsider status made this something that where everyone could finally let loose, because I think we’re also a very nice city, we’re a Southern city. So I think that clearly everyone had been feeling this way … (but) they needed someone else to step out and say it first.”Not everyone appreciated Lee’s feedback on his Atlanta visit, however.Devon Green is a part owner at Milk and Honey, a restaurant west of Atlanta that is known for its brunches. His restaurant is being mistaken for The Real Milk and Honey, the place Lee attempted to review.Green told Atlanta’s 11 Alive his business has been inundated with threats from some of Lee’s followers who are confusing his restaurant with the one Lee talked about.“A bomb from negative comments, death threats, threats to blow the building up, threats to end our business,” Green said. “We started getting bad reviews on Yelp. People were calling our phones. It was a nightmare.”CNN has reached out to Green for comment.Lee also appears to have felt threatened by the online fracas surrounding his Atlanta visit.After the uproar he posted a video telling his followers “I can’t win for losing” and explaining that most of the time he reviews restaurants that have been suggested to him or he’s been requested to. Lee said he’s never malicious when it comes to his reviews.“I understand everybody gonna have an opinion on the situation. You can disagree with me. You can not like what I say. Completely understand,” he said. “I’m ok with that. But when my safety and my family safety are coming into play, that’s where I draw the line.”Miguel Hernandez is one Atlanta restaurateur who was hoping Lee would stop by.A co-owner of Rreal Tacos, a local chain of fast-casual eateries, he has an appreciation for food influencers and said that during a recent trip to Dallas he used TikTok to find someplace good to eat.“I think that these influencers, they know the power that they have.

CNN,Sound of the underground: This guitar maker finds music in mushrooms,2023-11-01 12:50:00,Flo Cornall,"When you think of a guitar what comes to mind? Maybe it’s a simple maple acoustic, the kind played by countless singer-songwriters over the years, or perhaps a double-necked mahogany electric, favored more by rock-god types.While these classic guitars will always have a firm spot in our playlists, there are some new designs making waves by harnessing some peculiar materials.Guitar maker and master luthier Rachel Rosenkrantz thinks she’s hit the right note crafting bespoke instruments out of biomaterials. From mushroom ukuleles and beehive guitars to banjos made out of kombucha leather, she’s assembled a curious collection of biodegradable instruments.It all began in the early 2000s, when Rosenkrantz was a 21-year-old student in Paris torn between becoming a musician or a visual artist. Guitar-making combined her two passions – but local luthiers said she was too old to start even at that young age – so she stuck with design.Ten years later and a move to Rhode Island in the US changed her tune. She picked up music again, began her training and has been building guitars for nearly 13 years.“Maybe it didn’t happen when I was 21, but now I’m 42 and I’m actually doing it, so it’s never too late,” Rosenkrantz told CNN.Biomaterials entered the picture when she considered the impact guitar-making has on certain tree species.“Even though we [guitar makers] don’t represent a huge portion of the people that consume wood, we do serious damage in some areas,” Rosenkrantz said. “But I think guitar makers are more conscious about where they get their woods.”Around 2.6 million guitars are produced annually in the US alone. But unlike the construction and furniture industries, which favor quick-growing timber, the guitar industry typically uses rarer and older woods such as mahogany, ebony and rosewood.Trees are cut perpendicular to their growth rings for a better sound, and covering an entire guitar’s front, back, and sides means larger logs, like those of old-growths, are needed. Not all of these are sustainable.Brazilian rosewood was once highly prized for guitars, but the tree, found only in the coastal Brazilian Atlantic Forest, faces serious threats from illegal logging to clear land for agriculture and other uses. Since 1992, its use has been effectively banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Sitka spruce has been widely used to make acoustic guitars, but it’s often taken from Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, where widespread logging for various industries has some guitar makers calling for more sustainable alternatives. “All it takes is to have some ethics,” Rosenkrantz said. “Just doing the right thing makes a big difference.”Early in her guitar-making career, Rosenkrantz questioned what could be done without wood and plastics. From her background in design, she saw that biomaterials were being used in everything from BMW cars to sneakers.Her entry point was replacing plastic with fish skin, which she sources from a vendor in Brazil who makes tilapia leather out of fish farm waste. “It [fish skin] is stronger than plastic, more pliable than plastic,” she said. “For the pick guard that protects the instrument from scratching, it follows the motion of the wood.”Mycelium – a root-like structure composed of thin threads made by fungi – caught Rosenkrantz’s attention when she saw it used as a packaging replacement for polystyrene. “Polystyrene conducts sound amazingly because it’s full of air,” she observed, “so what if the natural counterpart has the same property?”Once the material dries, it packs together lots of hollow fibers like a spaghetti bundle, so that it resonates in a similar way to wood, explained Rosenkrantz, who also teaches at the Rhode Island School of Design.She sources mycelium from a vendor in upstate New York, and says it can be grown in any shape, meaning that working with it doesn’t leave off cuts that go to waste. Her “Mycocaster” electric guitar is made from mycelium and paper, with dried fibers such as corn husk added to make the guitar body more rigid.Rosenkrantz’s quirky creations sound slightly different from conventional guitars, depending on the biomaterial they are made from. The “Mycocaster” has a twangy and nasally tone. “I didn’t know it would have that timbre,” she said. However, it did make her think that these instruments could serve niche and perhaps novel genres of music.“If we want to create new sounds, we might look into new materials,” Rosenkrantz added.For the Mycocaster, she went a step further by adding some pickups and microphones into the mycelium body which she can adjust depending on how much “mushroom sound” the user wants.A number of her clients have unusual requests. A musician who composes film soundtracks asked for something that could sound like a range of instruments, so Rosenkrantz made a nine-string baritone electro-acoustic guitar, which incorporated waste fish skin.Another musician asked for a guitar with two necks, made completely from upcycled elements. The end result is part guitar and part bass, and was made using the client’s 40-year-old pickups, a vintage cigar humidor box as the body, a handle from an old suitcase, and kitchen backsplash tiles as fingerboard markers.These bespoke guitars don’t come cheap, though. Rosenkrantz’s Mycocaster currently costs $4,000, and she has three orders in the works. She’d like to bring costs down further, but concedes that she’d need help from a bigger manufacturer.“I would love for it to be like 50 bucks and every kid can afford one,” Rosenkrantz said. “Maybe a mushroom guitar is a way to actually achieve that, that would be my dream.”“I have faith in the future,” she added. “What might be considered weird today might not be weird tomorrow.”",5778,https://www.cnn.com/style/guitar-maker-mushrooms-biomaterials-rosenkrantz-spc/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231030105730-rachel-rosenkrantz-guitar-image-3.jpg?c=original&q=h_618,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,local cigar user structure step leather playlist york widespread vintage element combine played stuck simple bundle car spaghetti alternative source building start design guitar ukulele nasally conduct specie dry caught bmw pick incorporate student happen mind upstate attention found spot quirky vendor genre rachel banjo property luthier biomaterials picture coastal artist full wave impact big rosewood kid island create ethic ring baritone skin ebony soundtrack note rarer unusual natural forest compose threat spruce mushroom suitcase enter early craft fiber construction follow serve harness biodegradable creation conscious growth back front teach slightly cover replacement passion maker twangy kitchen pickup countless part kombucha tonga bass kind completely plastic microphone upcycled grown tree film husk amazingly favor thin composes faith concedes corn biomaterial strong wood conventional large sitka produce add future hollow tone humidor weird widely meaning training move brazilian land number represent highly mycocaster convention visual result prize work motion body torn order entire similar rhode packaging currently mycelium cost atlantic material typically paper rosenkrantz sound resonates million depend neck call furniture musician career annually endanger classic request consume handle entry background told international fingerboard guard national effectively buck protects picked leave tilapia cheap collection fish range lot point age firm shape side industry ban air young bespoke timber consider year change bring waste counterpart explain niche instrument mahogany question curious replace acoustic trade achieve timbre backsplash today beehive begin different pack huge adjust agriculture assemble school perpendicular area damage polystyrene electric portion thread hit alaska fungi client peculiar late scratch sustainable box farm music observe unlike afford illegal master paris make tomorrow maple brazil clear cut love pliable,0.97995,0.2596053997923156,9.20385585585586,0.4594354049526463,0,2023-11-01
