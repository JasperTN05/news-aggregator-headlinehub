Politico,Trump seeks halt to D.C. criminal case,2023-12-07 13:49:00,Josh Gerstein,"Donald Trump is demanding that a judge halt all proceedings in the federal criminal case charging him with trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election.Trump contends that U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan no longer has power over the case while he appeals her ruling that Trump is not immune from the charges he’s facing — a process that could take weeks or months. In the meantime, he says, Chutkan must postpone all deadlines and cede her authority over the matter.Citing “political costs to President Trump and this country” if the case were to move forward, Trump’s lawyers argued Thursday that he’s entitled to an “automatic stay” while he appeals Chutkan’s ruling last week.If Chutkan accedes to the demand, it could jeopardize her plan to begin the trial of the former president on March 4 at a Washington courthouse just blocks from the Capitol his supporters attacked on Jan. 6, 2021.Trump is appealing Chutkan’s order denying his claim that he enjoys immunity from prosecution on the election-related charges by virtue of the fact he was serving as president at the time. The order also turned down his argument that he can’t be prosecuted because he was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate for his conduct related to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6.“The filing of President Trump’s notice of appeal has deprived this Court of jurisdiction over this case in its entirety pending resolution of the appeal,” Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and John Lauro wrote. “Therefore, a stay of all further proceedings is mandatory and automatic.”Trump’s attorneys indicated that even if Chutkan doesn’t grant the stay, they plan to ask the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to do so and intend to operate as if there is one in place. That could be consequential in a case that is expected to be just three months away from trial. Prospective jurors have already begun receiving initial notices from the courthouse.The lawyers said that unless Chutkan rules otherwise, they plan to ignore upcoming deadlines in the case regarding pretrial motions, exchanges of information with prosecutors and designation of expert witnesses.Trump’s legal team said in its 11-page filing that prosecutors from special counsel Jack Smith’s office have indicated they plan to oppose the stay.Trump’s lawyers noted that prosecutors have acknowledged that Trump can’t be forced to go to trial in the case while an immunity appeal is pending. But according to Trump’s lawyers, the prosecutors appeared to seek to leave the door open to pretrial proceedings such as motions, hearings and trial planning in the coming months.Trump’s attorneys rejected that approach, arguing that the former president is entitled to avoid “the burdens of litigation” while his appeal goes forward, including the impact on his ongoing campaign for reelection to the presidency.“Concerns regarding judicial resources and costs from continued litigation during the pendency of the appeal — including financial, reputational, and political costs to President Trump and this country — are significant,” Blanche and Lauro wrote.A spokesperson for Smith’s office declined to comment Thursday.",3156,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/trump-seeks-halt-to-d-c-criminal-case-00130662,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/f056bea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4708x3139+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F9a%2Fa2%2F6561efde4a56ba36d446343d2403%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1683732924,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country prospective motion judicial criminal case ongoing operate argument ruling intend todd jurisdiction immune postpone attack judge force prosecutor stay expert special trial charge planning court subvert forward continued exchange expect enjoys jeopardize concern entitle appeal power smith lawyer plan argue rule consequential leave proceeding grant legal campaign pendency blanche president designation open month regard receive attorney jack comment accedes acquit write presidential prosecution pretrial cost demand immunity senate week fact trump ignore serve place reputational resource seek avoid financial decline begin deny mandatory move note accord process john federal information include entirety deadline reelection political pending impact circuit meantime chutkan significant virtue longer juror indicate conduct notice thursday order time team capitol automatic washington litigation house upcoming initial office authority contends burden cede donald turn prosecute filing former halt oppose block claim supporter hearing acknowledge march away approach related courthouse lauro district resolution spokesperson counsel reject riot impeach deprive,-0.9746,0.0,10.928208695652174,0.3027360066833751,0,2023-12-07
Politico,Colorado’s top court offers few hints on whether it will remove Trump from ballot,2023-12-06 18:17:00,Kyle Cheney,"The Colorado Supreme Court spent two hours on Wednesday debating Donald Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, but the court gave little indication of how it will rule on the ultimate question before it: whether Trump’s actions that day preclude him from running for president in 2024.Several of the court’s seven justices, all Democratic appointees, appeared to agree, at least, with a trial judge’s conclusion that the Jan. 6 attack amounted to an insurrection. They sharply questioned a contention from Trump’s lawyer that the violence didn’t last long enough, cover a wide enough area or involve enough deadly weapons to qualify.“As to insurrection, why isn’t it enough that a violent mob breached the Capitol when Congress was performing a core constitutional function,” Justice William Hood III said, noting he was setting aside Trump’s culpability. “In some ways, that seems like a poster child for insurrection.”The comments from Hood and other justices suggest that the Colorado Supreme Court could be the first top state court to officially recognize the attack as an insurrection, a key legal determination as courts and election officials in numerous states grapple with challenges to Trump’s eligibility under the 14th Amendment, which bars candidates from holding public office if they engaged in an insurrection after taking an oath to support the Constitution.The Colorado justices seemed well aware that they may not have the final word in the case — a bid by several Colorado voters, backed by advocacy groups, to remove Trump from the state’s presidential ballot. Voters and advocates have filed similar challenges across the nation, including a new lawsuit filed Wednesday in Oregon.“If we were to say that President Trump can’t be on the ballot here, there is a very high probability the United States Supreme Court would step in and decide,” Hood said.A Denver judge ruled last month that Trump did in fact incite the Jan. 6 insurrection but that he was nevertheless able to remain on the ballot because it is not clear that the 14th Amendment’s ban applies to the office of the president. The Colorado Supreme Court is weighing the appeal of that ruling.Some of the justices seemed uncomfortable with the idea that they would be taking away a choice that millions of Colorado voters might make. But they gave few hints on how, or when, they will rule.The justices appeared to have a much clearer view on whether to qualify Jan. 6 as an insurrection. Several agreed that the term “insurrection” was meant to apply to something “less than a war” or a “rebellion.”Trump’s attorney, former Colorado secretary of state Scott Gessler, said there isn’t a clear definition of the term and that the entire issue isn’t something courts can fairly resolve. But he said that if pressed, he would contend that the Jan. 6 violence was not an insurrection but rather a “three-hour riot” targeted at a single building.It didn’t last long enough or cover enough geographic territory to qualify as an insurrection, he said. And he said the many makeshift weapons used by the crowd — like flagpoles and bike racks — didn’t bear the hallmarks of an insurrection.“The goals were not as broad as the Shays’ rebellion, the Whiskey rebellion,” Gessler said. “An insurrection is organized, deadly force that’s going to nullify government authority.”Several federal judges in Washington, D.C., have described the Jan. 6 attack as an insurrection, and prosecutors have charged more than 1,200 participants in the attack, with hundreds of additional defendants likely to be added. Though most were unarmed, prosecutors have charged at least half a dozen people for carrying firearms and hundreds with wielding other weapons on Capitol grounds, including knives, hammers, bats, chemical spray and tasers. About two dozen participants — all affiliated with the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers — have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy, an agreement to derail the transfer of power using force.Hood pushed back on Gessler’s argument that removing Trump from the ballot in Colorado would create chaos because of the lack of uniformity across the country.Hood suggested that the court had a duty to resolve the case now, saying that a “counterargument is that by failing to resolve this issue on the merits now, we create the potential for chaos in January 2025.”",4391,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/colorados-top-court-offers-few-hints-on-whether-it-will-remove-trump-from-ballot-00130508,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/59583cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F40%2F10%2Fab24bde04b50b7d3f91c446b6140%2Fdonald-trump-addresses-supporters-after-arraignment-99723.jpg,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,culpability case month unarmed poster contention official issue core violence attack agreement described uniformity add hammer chemical shay incite appeal insurrection government guilty hallmark makeshift suggest power clearer entire colorado remove justice democratic long role area involve meant grapple office numerous potential supreme capitol challenge territory engage hint lawyer amendment nation support argument presidential ballot clear flagpole chaos fail ultimate target president word riot recognize federal trump weapon away uncomfortable seditious boy public organize force ground fairly half final appointee weigh question probability deadly judge proud applies set hundred charge include bar advocacy function term former create comment goal group washington carry bid mob push conspiracy participant geographic single wide breach aware conclusion press action candidate united constitutional indication spent high key similar day resolve agree view convict attorney violent duty spray state contend counterargument firearm bike decide derail note fact definition idea prosecutor make file defendant dozen nullify transfer wednesday voter knife give keeper gessler trial cover child preclude wield iii perform rebellion secretary hood january william legal lawsuit affiliate determination bear hour tasers advocate choice congress run qualify additional officially court crowd election amount debate denver hold sharply top donald back whiskey broad remain step ban oath rule merit eligibility lack rack apply million scott plead,-0.92975,0.3416078342063311,9.691223021582733,0.4479884684281235,0,2023-12-06
Politico,Top Nevada GOP officials charged with felonies for posing as pro-Trump 2020 electors,2023-12-06 15:55:00,Betsy Woodruff Swan,"A Nevada grand jury indicted the six Republicans who falsely pledged the state’s electoral votes to Donald Trump in 2020 as Trump sought to reverse his loss to Joe Biden in the state.The so-called alternate electors, one of whom is the head of the Nevada Republican Party, are each charged with two Nevada felonies related to the documents they signed purporting to be the state’s legitimate electors. The charges are for “offering a false instrument for filing” and “uttering a forged instrument.”Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, announced the grand jury’s indictment on Wednesday. POLITICO first revealed last month that Ford was overseeing a criminal probe into the electors.In December 2020, Trump’s allies convened slates of false electors in seven states that Biden won. The pro-Trump electors, consisting of Republican activists and operatives, signed certificates falsely claiming to be the proper representatives of the states’ voters in the Electoral College.Some of the electors said they took this step because lawyers advised them it was a lawful way to keep Trump’s options open if he won court challenges in the states where he was defeated, and documents signed by false electors in Pennsylvania and New Mexico explicitly said they were contingent on the outcome of lawsuits. But even after Trump’s lawsuits failed, his close allies used the existence of the false slates of electors to oppose Congress’ certification of the results on Jan. 6, 2021.Nevada is the third state to bring criminal charges against false electors; the others are Michigan and Georgia. Attorneys general in Arizona and New Mexico are also investigating Trump allies’ efforts to reverse the 2020 results in those states.“We cannot allow attacks on democracy to go unchallenged,” Ford said in a press release. “Today’s indictments are the product of a long and thorough investigation, and as we pursue this prosecution, I am confident that our judicial system will see justice done.”The defendants include Michael McDonald, the chair of the Nevada Republican Party; and Jim DeGraffenreid, its national committeeman. Jesse Law, the chair of the Clark County Republican Party, also faces charges. The other three defendants are Eileen Rice, Durward James Hindle III, and Shawn Meehan.The indictment accuses the six defendants of signing fake elector certificates “with the intent to defraud” U.S. government officials.DeGraffenreid and McDonald both sat for interviews with the House Jan. 6 select committee and responded to some questions by pleading the Fifth. CNN reported in June that both men also testified before special counsel Jack Smith’s federal grand jury in exchange for limited immunity.The Nevada Republican Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meehan declined to comment. The other defendants did not immediately respond or could not be reached.The indictments list five witnesses, including Kenneth Chesebro, a Trump lawyer who was an architect of the fake elector scheme. He pleaded guilty in Georgia in October for that work.",3070,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/nevada-criminal-charges-trump-false-electors-2020-00130457,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/88fe1c5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd0%2Ffe%2F47a74e94424fb6694f8deaf1f49e%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1546761588,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month michael scheme intent witness meehan mexico press georgia work attack nevada oversee legitimate democracy accuses jack exchange chair general option purport decline house investigation pennsylvania sign grand joe unchallenged arizona ford committee result democrat kenneth government activist operative smith guilty reveal attorney biden degraffenreid jesse signing bring convene rice state defraud today architect confident chesebro justice eileen falsely indictment representative sat explicitly law pursue oppose certificate interview investigate limited elector defendant long pledge ally james certification electoral close claim special wednesday challenge voter lawful offering party criminal report testify national alternate list lawyer shawn jury select release hindle announce december consist judicial fake fail effort michigan iii head forge federal proper advise product trump contingent probe lawsuit immediately open clark counsel outcome plead utter reverse politico prosecution mcdonald defeat related question false loss congress cnn charge court indict include request slate existence donald aaron durward comment step county october document republican respond committeeman june vote system instrument felony filing sought,-0.9013,0.0977198697068403,11.370091407678244,0.5201917130488559,0,2023-12-06
Politico,Jack Smith wants to tell jury about Trump’s earlier attempts to sow doubt about elections,2023-12-05 15:34:00,Kyle Cheney,"Special counsel Jack Smith wants a Washington, D.C. jury to hear about Donald Trump’s efforts to sow false doubts about the two presidential elections that preceded his failed 2020 campaign.The special counsel’s team says Trump’s previous attempts to convince Americans that the elections of 2012 and 2016 were being stolen laid the foundation for what would become a criminal effort to overturn the 2020 election after his loss to Joe Biden.“They demonstrate the defendant’s common plan of falsely blaming fraud for election results he does not like,” senior assistant special counsel Molly Gaston wrote in a nine-page court filing.Smith is seeking permission from U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to introduce evidence that isn’t specifically charged in the criminal indictment but may be relevant to the jury’s consideration of the alleged crimes. These details, known as 404(b) evidence, are commonly introduced in criminal matters to aid the jury’s ability to consider a defendant’s intent or motive based on uncharged “bad acts.” In this case, Smith says the evidence will help jurors assess Trump’s intent during the frenzied weeks before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, as he sought to subvert the election.The false election fraud claims from prior years aren’t the only streams of 404(b) evidence that prosecutors want to introduce. Gaston indicated that they intend to tell jurors about Trump’s repeated refusals in 2016 and 2020 to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. They want to introduce his September 2020 exhortation to the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by,” which became a call to action for the group’s leaders at the time and put the group on a path to becoming an integral part of the Jan. 6 breach of the Capitol.Prosecutors also say Trump engaged in a campaign of retaliation against Republican Party allies who refused to countenance his claims of election fraud — including the former legal counsel of the RNC.Prosecutors also reiterated that they anticipate telling jurors about Trump’s efforts to align himself with Jan. 6 rioters in the years following the violence. Trump has described them as “hostages,” vowed to consider pardoning many of them, complained of the sentences doled out even to the most serious offenders and even recorded a song with some of the most violent riot defendants housed at the D.C. jail.“This evidence shows that the rioters’ disruption of the certification proceeding is exactly what the defendant intended on January 6,” Gaston wrote.Trump spent the days and weeks leading up to the 2012 election — when President Barack Obama would best GOP nominee Mitt Romney to win reelection — complaining without basis that voting machines were being manipulated or that the election was being tainted by fraud. In 2016, before winning the White House, Trump began to argue that Republicans were “naïve” not to think rampant cheating was occurring.",2910,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/jack-smith-trump-elections-jan-6-00130200,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/d520b92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3640x2427+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb3%2Faf%2Fd276385e481eaab528c75dcf57e4%2Ftrump-capital-riot-gag-order-85284.jpg,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,false refuse violence demonstrate assistant offender riot indicate republican doubt begin trump stand case path commonly attack effort chutkan time naïve rioter charge repeat pardon group fail falsely described reiterate basis obama exhortation allege song january specifically smith criminal doled win jury hostage jack molly indictment consider loss claim barack argue year spent consideration action engage voting taint counsel frenzied laid intend write ally white capitol introduce boy convince house transfer back detail sentence judge donald subvert special juror team hear rampant precede countenance legal election seek common gop overturn breach include manipulate stream prosecutor uncharged integral aid disruption american motive commit violent steal campaign fraud proud proceed sow refusal party lead reelection joe romney former foundation presidential record b plan september complain week part retaliation power base follow sought anticipate certification gaston matter align day result vowed prior intent blame nominee previous call occur attempt court evidence senior peaceful put washington cheat ability leader permission show crime ass machine president relevant defendant district,-0.9853,0.0,10.69622429906542,0.4328571428571427,0,2023-12-05
Politico,Supreme Court unlikely to launch preemptive strike on wealth tax proposals,2023-12-05 15:20:00,Brian Faler,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday sounded skeptical of a conservative-backed bid to preemptively block Congress from ever passing a tax on wealth.Conservative and liberal justices asked tough questions of a lawyer representing a Washington state couple seeking to throw out a one-time “repatriation” tax on big companies’ overseas earnings. That tax is an arcane but important provision of Republicans’ 2017 tax bill, which largely cut taxes.But some wealthy Americans and pro-business groups are hoping to use the case as a vehicle to kill off much more than the repatriation tax. They have urged a broad ruling that would slam the legal door on any prospect of a wealth tax — a proposal that is gaining popularity on the left but also raises constitutional questions.The court took the case in June amid intense scrutiny of some conservative justices’ relationships with billionaires who use their fortunes to advance political agendas focused on lowering taxes and reining in the role of the federal government.But on Tuesday, the justices repeatedly questioned the distinctions a lawyer for the taxpayers, Andrew Grossman, attempted to draw between the repatriation tax and other taxes that have long been on the books.“Why is this any different?” Justice Elena Kagan asked. “There’s a long, century-old history of these kinds of taxes.”However, some GOP-appointed justices — particularly Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito — seemed wary of an unalloyed victory for the government and appeared to be pushing for an outcome that would preserve latitude for the court to limit federal taxing powers in a future case.Gorsuch told Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar that the government’s arguments seemed to allow federal authorities to declare almost anything to be income and tax it.“I’m just asking what the limits of your argument are, and it seems to me there are none,” he said, saying that was a “big door” he was unwilling to leave open.“That door is already open,” Prelogar responded, citing a series of Supreme Court precedents giving the federal government broad authority to tax various kinds of investments.By the end of the two-hour-long argument session, the justices seemed to be leaning toward a narrow ruling for the government, with Gorsuch repeatedly asking Prelogar how they might craft a decision in her favor that puts aside some of the thornier issues raised by the case.Earlier this year, Alito took the unusual step of publicly rejecting calls for him to step aside from the tax case because of his ties to one of the lawyers representing the Washington couple.The lawyer, David Rivkin, interviewed Alito on a couple of occasions earlier this year for the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page. In a four-page statement released in September, Alito turned down calls from Democratic lawmakers for him to recuse based on the interviews and his relationship with Rivkin.Rivkin did not argue the case Tuesday, leaving that task to Grossman. Both are partners at Ohio-based law firm BakerHostetler. Rivkin was on hand and sat quietly at the far end of the table assigned to counsel for the taxpayers.At one point, Alito seemed to go out of his way to emphasize that he was seeking to deal fairly with the arguments presented by both sides. He was also the only justice to allude to news reports about the case, which have generally focused on its potential to act as a preemptive strike against a future wealth tax.“One of the arguments that you press most strongly, and certainly it has resonated a lot in the coverage of this case, is that the adoption of the petitioners’ arguments would have far-reaching consequences,” Alito said to Prelogar. “So, do you think it is fair then to explore what the consequences of your argument would be?”The court doesn’t take many tax cases, and even fewer like this one that raise questions of what counts as income.The couple, Charles and Kathleen Moore, complain the repatriation tax triggered a $15,000 tax bill on an investment in an Indian power tool company on which they never received any income. They say the company plowed all of its earnings back into its operations. That makes the repatriation tax a levy on property, not income, they argue, and federal property taxes are effectively banned by the Constitution.If the court were to throw out the repatriation tax, big companies could receive billions in tax refunds, perhaps with interest. And a broad ruling could also preempt any possibility of Congress adopting wealth tax proposals pushed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other progressives. Backed by a phalanx of conservative groups, the Moores had asked the court to specifically take up the case to foreclose the possibility of a wealth tax.At the same time, tax watchers are concerned the justices — who are no experts in the arcana of taxation — could inadvertently blow big holes in the code if they don’t tread carefully. These observers point to a number of long-standing provisions in the code that tax people before they actually receive income, typically in the name of trying to prevent people from dodging the IRS. Many have warned that a sweeping ruling against taxes on “unrealized gains” could throw into legal doubt scads of other sections of the code.The government pressed on those concerns Tuesday, pointing to a long history of taxes going back to the inauguration of the income tax. Prelogar said it’s difficult to draw lines between those provisions and the repatriation tax. A ruling for the Moores would create havoc, she argued.“It would cause a sea change in the operation of the tax code and cost trillions of dollars in lost tax revenue,” she said.Alito noted that the tax in question covers income dating back 30 years, and he questioned whether at some point a tax purportedly on income might functionally be one on wealth.“Let’s say somebody graduates from school and starts up a little business in his garage, and 20 years later, 30 years later, that person is a billionaire,” Alito said. “Under your argument, can Congress tax all of that on the ground that is income?”Prelogar called that a “harder question,” adding, “We don’t have the same tradition to support Congress levying income taxes in that manner.”Among the court’s six Republican appointees, Justice Brett Kavanaugh sounded the most untroubled by the government’s position in the case. He dismissed some of his colleagues’ concerns about a broad-based wealth tax as ungrounded in political reality.“On the proverbial open door … members of Congress want to get reelected,” Kavanaugh said, triggering laughter in the courtroom. “Some of the hypos — that’s why they’re far-fetched.”A ruling in the case is expected by late June.",6701,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/supreme-court-wealth-tax-proposals-00130195,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/b71ea90/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F29%2F05%2Fa93ec2d14968b5c06d2e7940cf6c%2Fu-s-supreme-court-82963.jpg,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,deal side appointee blow fortune preemptive property lower draw change doubt interviewed reject generally popularity unusual lose levy time craft group vehicle tough couple tool repatriation lean firm liberal latitude release particularly raise issue graduate watcher harder big amid purportedly scad argue andrew wealthy resonate question hypo democratic throw observer plow laughter lot brett news unrealized cost page fairly note arcanum constitutional ground report samuel carefully recuse statement explore concern dodge kathleen narrow political street bill largely dismiss income skeptical unalloyed wealth history indian tread lawyer role preserve person receive adoption warn taxpayer tradition provision kagan progressive assign turn give tie push september number limit company base editorial tax general solicitor precedent justice untroubled business strongly ruling future point unwilling attempt hole coverage fair foreclose havoc billion make preempt distinction intense urge sat declare inauguration law charles strike arcane ban expert long represent republican effectively authority case leave lawmaker elizabeth proposal date hop moore sweep session respond relationship dollar petitioner adopt functionally start phalanx irs late advance specifically victory ungrounded conservative alito emphasize wary operation important difficult investment possibility federal gorsuch series trillion year told state cover hand interest task publicly counsel consequence proverbial step agenda focus table prospect kind occasion grossman back inadvertently quietly expect argument courtroom position prelogar support reelect garage preemptively thornier legal seek billionaire passing david cut government line elena prevent bakerhostetler neil colleague outcome potential block different kavanaugh sound interview open trigger congress american code count revenue scrutiny slam rivkin favor allude repeatedly overseas left concerned taxation create member earnings journal press present complain power wall supreme refund rein broad section earlier kill typically bid call june court school put washington partner add warren decision tuesday act,0.8719,0.2238471869870169,10.135589414595028,0.4378769841269842,0,2023-12-05
Reuters,"Convictions should outlive defendants' deaths, US tells appeals court",2023-12-04 23:03:00,Nate Raymond,"Dec 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday urged a federal appeals court in Boston to break new ground by holding that a defendant's conviction outlasts his death and does not get wiped away just because he died before his appeal could be heard, in a case involving a former biotech chief executive's securities fraud conviction.Prosecutors in making that argument to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged that every other federal appeals court would under their precedents vacate former PixarBio Corp CEO Frank Reynolds' conviction following his 2022 death.But Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Quinlivan told the three-judge panel the practice had no constitutional basis and was inconsistent with statutes like the Victims Rights Act aimed at protecting victims and holding those who wronged them accountable.""It really is a slap in the face to the victims of a crime and their loved ones because it tells them that they are unimportant and indeed irrelevant in the eyes of the law,"" Quinlivan said.Reynolds was found guilty in 2019 by a federal jury of carrying out a scheme to mislead investors into believing he was a successful inventor with a drug in development that would end opioid addiction.But prosecutors said the claims he made about himself, the drug and its regulatory approval timeline were overhyped and untrue and his goal was to defraud investors out of their money, pump up the value of his company's stock and get rich in the process.Reynolds was sentenced in 2020 to seven years in prison and ordered to forfeit $280,000 and pay about $7.5 million in restitution to his victims. When he died mid-appeal, prosecutors asked the 1st Circuit to not vacate his conviction.The other 11 regional appeals courts have adopted a legal doctrine under the common law known as ""abatement ab initio,"" in which trial convictions are vacated when a defendant dies before he or she can exhaust their appeals.U.S. Circuit Judge William Kayatta said prosecutors needed ""a pretty good argument to upset an apple cart that is going uniformly across the country without any sign of being a big problem.""But Quinlivan noted a growing number of states (31) have in recent years abandoned the practice of vacating convictions at the state court level for defendants who died during appeals.Quinlivan said vacating a deceased defendant's convictions also means wiping out financial penalties imposed at a defendant's sentencing, including restitution ordered to compensate those victims.U.S. Circuit Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson, though, noted the Justice Department can in that instance bring a civil case against a defendant's estate, a route that would allow family members a fair chance to contest any restitution.""Even though there's been a conviction, until that conviction has been fully reviewed for error, then it shouldn't count as a final judgment,"" she said.Judith Mizner, a federal public defender appointed after Reynolds died by the 1st Circuit to argue in favor of vacating convictions, said the doctrine respected the fundamental role appeals play in ensuring a conviction was just.""It is a fundamental part of our criminal justice system,"" she said.The case is United States v.

Reuters,US judiciary cuts budget request to Congress but warns of shortfall,2023-12-01 21:49:00,Nate Raymond,"Dec 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. federal judiciary on Friday said it had reduced its 2024 budget request by nearly $184 million but would still face funding gaps under pending bills in Congress that would require ""significant"" cuts in court and public defender staffing.The judiciary in March had sought $9.14 billion for the 2024 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, an 8% increase from 2023. It is now seeking $8.95 billion, up 5.8%, after scaled-back hiring and investments resulted in savings that can offset its 2024 needs.But in a letter to key members of Congress, U.S. Circuit Judge Amy St. Eve, who chairs the Judicial Conference's Budget Committee, and U.S. District Judge Roslynn Mauskopf, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts' outgoing director, warned those savings would not fully make up for shortfalls in pending bills.Congress has yet to finalize annual budgets for the current fiscal year, and the government is currently operating under stopgap spending measures that expire in early 2024.Bills moving through the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate would give the court system a modest budget increase over $8.46 billion in funding in 2023.But even given the scaled-back budget request, the Republican-led House's bill provides $270 million less than what the judiciary needs, and the Democratic-led Senate's version falls $387 million short, the judges wrote in a Nov. 8 letter made public Friday.They said that without any actions to address those funding gaps, the judiciary will need to defer security improvements, and courts and federal defender organizations will face potential staff reductions that have ""significant real-world effects.""Federal defender organizations, which provide court-appointed lawyers for defendants who cannot afford to hire attorneys, are already subject to a hiring freeze and have warned they would face further downsizing if either bill in Congress became law.Without sufficient staffing, St. Eve and Mauskopf warned that the judiciary would not be able to properly ensure court-appointed counsel for all eligible defendants, who have a constitutional right to an attorney.They also warned the bills would hinder the judiciary's ability to staff up probation offices to respond to a U.S. Sentencing Commission decision in August to retroactively apply certain changes to sentencing guidelines and allow thousands of first-time offenders to seek sentence reductions.The judges in their letter said that decision will result in the need for probation staff to help process more than 18,700 sentence reduction motions and supervise 7,500 incarcerated individuals eligible for release in 2024.While the judiciary cut its funding request for most federal appeals courts and district courts, it increased by $13.5 million how much the U.S. Supreme Court is seeking in discretionary funding to $161.3 million, up from $138.8 million in 2023.The judiciary's budget documents did not explain the change in proposed U.S. Supreme Court funding. Representatives for the Supreme Court did not respond to a request for comment.Read more:US judiciary's budget process to blame for potential public defender cuts, report saysUS judiciary warns Congress against cuts to public defender, cyber spendingUS public defenders could lose hundreds of staff in budget shortfall, officials sayJumpstart your morning with top legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket.",3427,https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judiciary-cuts-budget-request-congress-warns-shortfall-2023-12-01/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/WGKDLELERRKJDOB4XYGUZ3MBFM.jpg,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,defendant make increase court government reuters investment amy begin conference finalize seek roslynn document saving administrative warns legal dec judicial staff sayjumpstart key warn morning official bill judge significant supervise straight measure defer deliver hire currently senate representative commission apply spending subject gap incarcerate news march congress write sentence blame action daily august chair discretionary afford saysus fully ensure annual offender motion reduction thousand sought supreme mauskopf operating report district hinder eligible process early eve change security member year address version respond top give organization funding office require director effect request hundred public release sufficient federal billion lose attorney individual judiciary counsel stopgap constitutional guideline current expire system pending short outgo properly fall docket potential provide budget cyber circuit propose house freeze committee inbox shortfall downsize fiscal offset explain retroactively defender lawyer appeal probation spendingus ability result friday letter modest improvement million reduce move decision cut,0.91635,0.0,13.56734835355286,0.4271825396825396,0,2023-12-01
Reuters,Medical malpractice law firm deemed not liable to ex-client for press release after jury verdict,2023-12-01 21:31:00,Alison Frankel,"Dec 1 (Reuters) - The Illinois Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that lawyers are entitled after the conclusion of a trial to discuss previously confidential information that their clients disclosed publicly in trial testimony.In a stirring confirmation of trial lawyers' speech rights, Illinois Justice P. Scott Neville said that open access to court records is a cornerstone of the rule of law in the U.S. To hold lawyers liable for speaking afterward about information voluntarily revealed by their clients, Neville wrote for a unanimous court, “would fly in the face of these basic principles, which are at the core of our judicial system and our democracy.”You are no doubt wondering about the circumstances that required the Illinois Supreme Court to reassure lawyers about their right to speak publicly about their victories. Be warned: It’s not a happy tale.In 2015, Chicago plaintiffs' lawyer Elizabeth Kaveny and her law firm at the time, Burke Wise Morrissey & Kaveny, won a $4.2 million medical malpractice verdict for a client who alleged that a hospital in the Chicago suburbs bungled his care after he was admitted to the psychiatric unit.After the verdict, Kaveny spoke about the case to news outlets, describing the hospital’s failure to remove a knife from her client’s belongings even though he was admitted for overdosing on pills in an apparent suicide attempt. Kaveny, whose firm also issued a press release about the jury verdict, told news outlets that her client, while in the hospital's care, grabbed the knife and stabbed himself more than 30 times, sustaining near-fatal blood loss and related injuries that derailed his career for years.Those post-trial statements about the $4.2 million verdict sparked a dispute between Burke Wise and its client, who regarded the press release and Kaveny's quotations in news stories as an invasion of his privacy. In 2017, the client sued Kaveny and Burke Wise under an Illinois privacy law for publicly disclosing confidential information about his mental health.I am not naming the client, who was an attorney until the suicide attempts underlying the malpractice case, because he was granted anonymity in his suit against his former lawyers from Burke Wise.But there is no doubt that information about his mental health is a matter of public record for anyone who bothers to dig up filings from the underlying malpractice case. Significantly, the client himself testified at the malpractice trial -- publicly and in detail -- about his mental health, including his history of depression and anxiety, his suicide attempts and the cognitive impairment he continued to suffer, even years after the incident, from the brain injury he sustained as a result of blood loss from his self-inflicted stab wounds.He nevertheless claimed in his suit against Kaveny and Burke Wise that his lawyers were required to obtain his permission to re-disclose any information from medical records that had been subpoenaed for the malpractice trial.Kaveny and the firm, he said, breached the Illinois law safeguarding the privacy of patients’ mental health records by issuing their press release and talking to news outlets without getting advance clearance from him.An Illinois intermediate appellate court agreed. In a ruling last October, the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, held that Burke Wise’s client retained post-trial privacy rights over information that emerged in the litigation of his malpractice claims.Burke Wise was authorized to disclose and discuss its client’s mental health records as it litigated the malpractice case, the appeals court said, but the firm’s “subsequent broadcast of Doe's mental health history appears to be beyond the bounds of that proceeding.”On Thursday, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding unequivocally that the client waived his right to claim confidentiality when he voluntarily and publicly testified about his mental health during the malpractice trial.The state justices (two of whom were recused from the case) said it didn’t matter that the client’s mental health records were produced under a protective order, as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requires.Nothing in the federal healthcare privacy law or the Illinois law shielding patients’ mental health records “prevents legal counsel from discussing facts that were voluntarily revealed in a public trial,” the Supreme Court said. “In fact, the public nature of the proceeding not only removes the confidentiality of the voluntarily disclosed mental health information, but it also exempts from punishment anyone who speaks about the publicly released information.”The court separately ruled that Burke Wise could not be held liable under the Illinois law because it did not obtain its former client's health records in the context of providing therapeutic care to its client. That holding is less consequential, though, because Illinois has since amended the law to remove that requirement.The ex-client, who litigated the case against his former lawyers as John Doe, was represented by Thomas Paris, who did not respond to my email query. I left a message at a telephone number listed for Doe’s law office but did not immediately hear back.Burke Wise is no longer in operation. A successor law firm dissolved earlier this year. Kaveny, now a name partner at Kaveny + Kroll, did not respond to my email.She and her former firm were represented in Doe’s case by Hinshaw Culbertson. Hinshaw partner Kimberly Jansen declined to comment on the Supreme Court ruling, citing Doe’s recently refiled breach of duty case against his former lawyers.Jumpstart your morning with top legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket.",5748,https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/column-medical-malpractice-law-firm-deemed-not-liable-ex-client-press-release-2023-12-01/,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/SAFF4GJLYZP7JHAXX2AVQD2HMY.jpg,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,discus jury happy thursday overdose knife speech recuse reuters matter injury judicial impairment filing told warn morning left claimed comment paris client apparent fly significantly doe decline emerge advance amend stabbed testify portability news underlie statement write order daily permission fact partner story neville justice core admit duty related nature reveal spoke continued separately outlet supreme appellate bound plaintiff accountability act open anonymity telephone burke suffer produce liable stir privacy obtain former conclusion proceed office blood consequential prevents spark dissolve hinshaw hold public law litigation medical pill bother attorney failure authorize retain operation grabbed provide shield attempt kimberly earlier therapeutic sustain publicly hear firm discuss lawyer appeal longer entitle morrissey confidentiality safeguard subsequent october depression remove million ruling healthcare broadcast history query illinois court access context invasion regard mental patient trial legal dec intermediate wise include hospital straight clearance deliver cornerstone breach doubt kaveny suit rule subpoenaed insurance exempts stab time number speaks protective previously career recently dispute unequivocally message voluntarily reverse health kroll describe belonging culbertson bungle allege confidential quotation information chicago district john cognitive waive circumstance issue brain year respond top confirmation unanimous press disclose suburb malpractice require grant punishment release speak federal record immediately case principle refiled agree scott state verdict system reassure email litigate thomas anxiety jansen docket detail wonder inbox victory claim list psychiatric loss derail afterward held represent incident basic result elizabeth talk decision successor counsel suicide,0.0553,0.1565762004175365,12.24474103585657,0.3390406162464984,0,2023-12-01

Reuters,Pharma giants warn of 'chaos' in venue fight over US price-fixing cases,2023-12-01 21:07:00,Mike Scarcella,"Dec 1 (Reuters) - Major pharmaceutical firms are trying to bar a group of states that sued them from leaving centralized antitrust litigation in Philadelphia, warning of ""chaos"" if the companies are forced to fight the same price-fixing claims in more than one venue.Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers Teva, Sandoz, Aurobindo and others on Wednesday asked the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to keep the lawsuits consolidated in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.Dozens of generic pharma companies are accused in the wide-ranging litigation of conspiring to fix price on hundreds of drugs. The companies in their filing opposed a request by Connecticut and other states to return their own cases to federal court in Connecticut, where the lawsuits were first brought in 2016.At the heart of the venue dispute is a new federal law that says states can pick where they want to pursue antitrust cases. A U.S. appeals court has allowed the measure to be applied in at least one other unrelated case involving Google.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in October rejected Google's bid to stop Texas from leaving multidistrict litigation in Manhattan federal court challenging the technology giant's advertising technology practices.Attorneys for Google argued the new federal law, called the Venue Act, only applied to future cases. The appeals court's order did not decide that question.Representatives for Teva, Sandoz, Aurobindo on Friday did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Connecticut Attorney General's office did not immediately respond to a similar request.The Venue Act, less than a year old, ""eliminates the delay, inefficiency, and associated higher cost that a state may encounter under existing law"" in antitrust litigation, according to the law's sponsors.The pharmaceutical companies' attorneys contend the law cannot be applied retroactively, and also that the states waited too long in seeking to leave the multidistrict proceeding in Pennsylvania.Attorneys for Connecticut and the other states argued in their Nov. 1 court filing that the new law was ""silent"" on whether it applied to pending cases.The case is In re: Generic Pharmaceuticals Pricing Antitrust Litigation, U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, MDL No. 2724.Liaison counsel for states: W.

Washington Post,Trump lawyer: Georgia trial would have to wait if Trump wins in 2024,2023-12-01 16:43:00,"Holly Bailey, Amy Gardner","ATLANTA — An attorney for former president Donald Trump told an Atlanta area judge Friday that if Trump wins the 2024 presidential election, his trial on charges that he illegally conspired to try to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia could not proceed until after he leaves the White House.Steven Sadow, Trump’s lead counsel in the sprawling Fulton County racketeering case, objected to prosecutors requesting an August 2024 trial date. Sadow claimed that if Trump wins the Republican nomination and is required to be on trial in the weeks leading up to Election Day 2024, it would be “election interference.”“Can you imagine the notion of the Republican nominee for president not being able to campaign for the presidency because he is in some form or fashion in a courtroom defending himself?” Sadow asked. “That would be the most effective election interference in the history of the United States, and I don’t think anyone would want to be in that position.”Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor leading the case, strongly rejected Sadow’s claim.“This trial does not constitute election interference. This is moving forward with the business of Fulton County,” Wade said. “I don’t think it in any way impedes defendant Trump’s ability to campaign.”When Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee asked Sadow whether the proceedings could continue into 2025 if Trump wins the presidency — as Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis (D) has publicly suggested — Sadow argued that the trial would interfere with his client’s duties as president under the Supremacy Clause, which prohibits interfering with constitutional duties, and would have to be postponed until he is out of office.The back and forth came as McAfee, who is overseeing the case, said it was too soon to set a trial date, pointing in part to the uncertain schedule of Trump’s other pending legal cases. That includes a scheduled March trial in the federal election interference case brought against Trump by special counsel Jack Smith and a pending May trial alleging that Trump mishandled and refused to return hundreds of classified documents.McAfee also asked prosecutors how long they would need to prepare for trial should an opening occur earlier than expected, appearing to allude to the possibility of a delay in one of the federal cases. The answer was 30 days — raising the possibility of a surprisingly swift trial start, depending on events.McAfee also suggested he was still considering splitting up the 15 remaining defendants in the case — potentially allowing some defendants to be tried separately from Trump — though he said he would not make any decisions until next year.Friday’s hours-long motions hearing was the most substantive one in the case so far, with lawyers for various defendants arguing motions that could lead to dismissal of charges in some cases. Even if McAfee does not rule for the defendants in these motions, their lawyers are also asking him to allow them to file pretrial appeals, which would allow them to make their case to the state Supreme Court — and could affect the timing of a trial date.Among the arguments presented Friday by various defendants: that the indictment violates the First Amendment by criminalizing political speech, that it improperly usurps federal supremacy by seeking to punish the pro-Trump electors who met and voted despite Joe Biden’s victory in the state, and that it is itself so poorly executed that it violates the requirement that an indictment be “perfect in form and substance.”Don Samuel, a lawyer for former state GOP lawyer Ray Smith, one of Trump’s co-defendants, gave as one example that his client has been charged with solicitation of violating an oath of office — yet the indictment doesn’t say what oath was violated. Prosecutors defended the indictment against claims made by Samuel and other lawyers.The hearing also marked Sadow’s first formal appearance before McAfee in the case — and one of the first public acknowledgments in open court that its main defendant will probably be the GOP nominee for president next year.“It’s very possible that my client will be running for election as President of the United States for the Republican Party,” Sadow said to a courtroom packed with dozens of lawyers and journalists. “This case should not be interfering with an election.”Sadow also pressed McAfee for help obtaining a list of evidence in Trump’s federal election-interference case, offering to write up subpoenas for the information that he hoped the judge would sign.Sadow cited as an example a published report that former vice president Mike Pence had shared notes with the special counsel’s office that he had taken in the chaotic weeks after Election Day. He argued that he was not yet asking for access to the evidence but merely wanted a list to determine whether any of it is relevant in the Georgia case.McAfee questioned his legal authority to order the retrieval of evidence in a federal case. Sadow said the consequence for him not getting to see the evidence could be dismissal of charges against his client.Sadow also told McAfee that he anticipated that Trump would probably be present during much of the Fulton County proceedings, including jury selection. But he said he was not sure whether Trump would attend proceedings every day.Sadow moved with characteristic swagger, wearing his signature cowboy boots and occupying a seat at the defense table for the entire hearing even as other lawyers moved in and out to make room for others whose motions were being considered.Since Trump and 18 of his allies were indicted in August, four defendants have pleaded guilty — including former pro-Trump attorneys Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell, who had requested speedy trials and were set to go before a jury in October. Both reached plea deals on the eve of their joint trial. Two other defendants — former Trump campaign adviser Jenna Ellis and Atlanta bail bondsman Scott Hall — also pleaded guilty. All have agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and testify at trial.Willis has repeatedly pressed for Trump and his 14 remaining co-defendants to be tried together. But two of Trump’s co-defendants filed motions asking McAfee to separate the trials, including former Trump legal adviser John Eastman.“There are a number of defendants who are not running for president of the United States,” Eastman’s lawyer, Wilmer “Buddy” Parker, argued. Parker said his client would be happy for his trial to come sooner than Trump’s trial.In his Sept. 14 order announcing that Chesebro and Powell would be tried separately, McAfee indicated he could consider “additional divisions” in the case — but would not make that decision until later. In the order, he nodded to prosecutors who have argued that trying all defendants at one time would be more “efficient” for the court. But McAfee also acknowledged logistical concerns about trying a multi-defendant case, including finding a courtroom large enough to accommodate all the defendants and their legal teams as well as security detail.On Friday, McAfee repeated those concerns — saying he had not ruled out trying all 15 defendants together but that he was still concerned about the logistics.

Aframe's supporters have called him ""exceptionally qualified"" and lauded his ""superb skills as a courtroom lawyer.""Aframe did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.The 1st Circuit hears cases from Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.The committee also advanced four nominations for U.S. district court vacancies in California, Oregon and other states.One of those nominees, U.S. Magistrate Judge Mustafa Kasubhai, would become only the third Muslim-American federal district court judge ever if he is confirmed to the Oregon federal bench.The other district court nominations that moved forward were California state judge Eumi Lee for the Northern District of California; U.S. Magistrate Judge Edward Kiel for the District of New Jersey; and Quinnipiac University law professor Sarah Russell for the Connecticut federal court.Russell faced renewed criticism on Thursday from Republicans over a COVID-era letter she and thousands of others signed urging Democratic Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont to take greater steps to protect incarcerated individuals from the coronavirus. The signatories called for a moratorium on new admissions to jails and prisons.Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called the letter ""radical"" and he and other conservatives on the judiciary committee said Russell was unfit to serve on the bench.At her confirmation hearing, Russell had called the letter ""overbroad"" and said it did not ""accurately"" reflect her views. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.The Senate has so far confirmed 158 of Biden's federal court nominees. The majority have been women and people of color, a reflection of Biden's pledge to boost diversity on the federal bench.The Senate on Wednesday confirmed federal prosecutors Micah Smith to serve on the U.S. district court in Hawaii, and Jamel Semper for the New Jersey federal bench.The full Senate on Thursday was expected to vote on the nomination of Hawaii judge Shanlyn Park to serve on the U.S. district court in the state.The Senate was also set to take a procedural vote on Thursday afternoon that would move 5th Circuit nominee Irma Ramirez a step closer to a confirmation vote. Ramirez, a U.S. magistrate judge in Dallas federal court, would be the circuit court's first Latina judge.Read more:US Senate confirms two Biden judicial nominees in New York, MinnesotaBiden secures confirmation for California, Michigan trial judgesBiden names new nominee for 1st Circuit after earlier pick withdrew",3085,https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/biden-pick-us-appeals-court-advances-us-senate-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,accurately ted expect judge confirms nov michigan sex skill laud consideration color republican nominee dallas signatory joe cruz minnesotabiden make exceptionally sign seth forward great reflection quinnipiac state crime qualify micah comment jamel biden superb york president hears island sentence northern include protect magistrate hampshire massachusetts step request latina recommendation pledge hawaii irma afternoon mustafa serve urge vote closer california woman circuit boost letter lee committee district democratic semper radical prosecutor aframe confirmation coronavirus criticism lamont overbroad reflect judgesbiden lawyer court jail senate call diversity procedural move connecticut kiel admission withdrew member law moratorium professor hearing renew pick eumi edward shanlyn conservative criticize supporter respond case judicial puerto sarah oregon earlier courtroom incarcerate rhode vacancy nomination set trial advanced individual secures thousand judiciary ramirez thursday confirm lenient unfit federal governor senator russell jersey view reuters smith kasubhai park wednesday full texas majority university immediately,0.92055,0.0972447325769854,14.02262230919765,0.6026244588744589,0,2023-11-30
Reuters,Law degree program axed at California's Golden Gate University amid accreditation woes,2023-11-30 20:24:00,Karen Sloan,"Nov 30 (Reuters) - Golden Gate University said on Thursday that it will discontinue the law school’s Juris Doctor program in May.Officials at the San Francisco school said the Golden Gate University School of Law will not close altogether and will continue to offer non-J.D. graduate and undergraduate degrees.“Given the realities of the marketplace, our law school’s place in it and a host of related trends and data, we determined it is no longer viable to offer this degree program,” reads a message from Golden Gate President David Finke and Board of Trustees Chair Barbara Mendelson.The move was not unexpected. University officials in May said the law school was in “financial exigency” and that its future was uncertain. The law school in October filed a plan with the American Bar Association laying out how it would handle remaining law students in the event of a closure.The Thursday message cited enrollment declines, a difficult employment market, and low bar exam pass rates as reasons for the closure. For several years Golden Gate has failed to meet the ABA’s accreditation requirement that at least 75% of law schools graduates pass the bar exam within two years.The school’s two-year pass rate was 63% for the class of 2020 and 67% for the class of 2019, according to ABA data. Golden Gate dramatically reduced the size of its first-year class in 2022 and provided full scholarships to all new full-time J.D. students in a bid to improve sagging bar pass rates and remain accredited, but those measures were not enough to save the J.D. program.Among the law school’s 118 graduates in 2022, 27% were unemployed and seeking work 10 months after graduation, ABA data shows.Current J.D. students have the option to transfer to another law school or complete their degree at Golden Gate under the plan submitted to the ABA, but the law school will not admit any new J.D. students. The message did not clarify what will happen to the law school’s 31 full-time faculty, but a university spokesperson said on Thursday that those decisions are forthcoming.At least seven law schools have closed since 2014, the most recent being Florida Coastal School of Law in 2021. No other universities have opted to end their J.D. programs without closing their law schools. Two other California law schools — the University of La Verne College of Law and Thomas Jefferson School of Law — opted in recent years to end their ABA accreditation and become accredited by the State Bar of California instead.Golden Gate Law currently offers a number of non-J.D. programs, including LL.M. degrees for both foreign and U.S.-trained attorneys as well as a master's degree program for non-lawyers. The university offers an undergraduate bachelor’s degree in law.Read more:Struggling San Francisco law school slashes class size, cancels tuitionFor-profit law schools, once flourishing, are nearly extinct",2890,https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/law-degree-program-axed-californias-golden-gate-university-amid-accreditation-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,month longer doctor host improve cancel accreditation foreign program class nov altogether data seek difficult bar thomas lay american board future handle currently florida discontinue year option school unexpected dramatically aba state sag place attorney master president determine undergraduate include struggle offer employment related trustee reduce close work graduation clarify coastal flourish official rate student jefferson faculty remain reason file california scholarship give exam closure bid admit trend spokesperson opt graduate plan barbara fail accord complete message continue provide requirement financial finke low read move decline reality law juris meet marketplace exigency closing october save unemployed viable decision uncertain submit chair san event david association recent verne bachelor measure college thursday happen gate reuters size accredit golden full market enrollment extinct francisco degree number university slash transfer,-0.7786500000000001,0.1038062283737024,10.050094161958564,0.3705965909090909,0,2023-11-30
Reuters,Lawyer in hundreds of food labeling lawsuits hit with contempt order,2023-11-30 20:20:00,Diana Novak Jones,"Nov 30 (Reuters) - A New York federal judge found that an attorney who has filed hundreds of class actions accusing companies of misleading labeling on foods and other products in civil contempt of court on Thursday, saying he filed a lawsuit against Starbucks in bad faith.Senior U.S. District Judge Frederick Scullin Jr issued the order against attorney Spencer Sheehan after dismissing a proposed class action Sheehan filed against Starbucks over the labeling on its French Roast Ground 100% Arabica coffee, saying the lawsuit was unsupported by studies, case law or “reasonable interpretations” of the labeling.Sheehan, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of plaintiff Kristie Brownell in November 2022, alleged that Starbucks was misrepresenting that the coffee contains no additives.Scullin noted that Sheehan had filed 18 lawsuits in his district since 2021 – with none making it past the motion to dismiss stage. Scullin said he would decide on Sheehan’s specific sanctions later.Neither Sheehan, who is based in Great Neck, New York, nor his attorneys immediately responded to requests for comment. Attorneys for Starbucks, which was not involved in the sanctions efforts, did not respond to a request for comment.Sheehan, who has garnered headlines for his lawsuits over product labeling, has said that he filed more than 500 lawsuits between January 2020 and April 2023. He has filed lawsuits claiming Kellogg's Strawberry Pop Tarts don’t contain enough strawberries and Walmart’s fudge mint cookies don’t contain any actual fudge or mint. Kellogg and Walmart beat the claims, court records show.In a May court filing in another case where a judge said he was considering sanctions, Sheehan said that he had never been sanctioned in the hundreds of cases he had filed against the biggest food companies.Scullin granted Starbucks’ motion to dismiss in July, finding that the plaintiff hadn’t shown there was added potassium in the coffee or that a reasonable consumer would have expected “100% Arabica coffee” to mean no additives.The case is Kristie Brownell et al v.

Reuters,"Artists take new shot at Stability, Midjourney in updated copyright lawsuit",2023-11-30 19:47:00,Blake Brittain,"Nov 30 (Reuters) - A group of visual artists has filed an amended copyright lawsuit against Stability AI, Midjourney and other companies for allegedly misusing their work to train generative artificial intelligence systems.U.S. District Judge William Orrick dismissed parts of the lawsuit last month but gave the original plaintiffs permission to pursue their claims again in a new complaint. Their amended lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, adds seven new artists to the proposed class action against Stability, Midjourney, DeviantArt and new defendant Runway AI, as well as more details on the alleged infringement.Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.Illustrators Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan and Karla Ortiz initially sued the companies in January, in one of the first of several lawsuits that have been filed by copyright owners against tech companies over the alleged use of their work in AI training.Orrick found flaws with some of the artists' arguments, including that the companies' AI output infringes their copyrights, but he left intact their core claim that the AI training process violates their rights.The plaintiffs reasserted their claims on Wednesday, now joined by artists H. Southworth, Grzegorz Rutkowski, Gregory Manchess, Gerald Brom, Jingna Zhang, Julia Kaye and Adam Ellis.""Though Defendants like to describe their AI image products in lofty terms, the reality is grubbier and nastier,"" the artists said. ""AI image products are primarily valued as copyright-laundering devices, promising customers the benefits of art without the costs of artists.""The visual artists said that the systems create art in their styles when their names are used as prompts, and that users have been creating works that are ""indistinguishable"" from theirs.""Recently, plaintiff Kelly McKernan was astonished to find that the top internet search result for their name is now an AI-generated image made with Midjourney, prompted with Mx.

Reuters,US law firm Loeb & Loeb elects partner duo to succeed chair,2023-11-30 19:12:00,Sara Merken,"Nov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. law firm Loeb & Loeb elected two of its partners, Mitchell Nussbaum and Arash Khalili, to lead the firm as co-chairs, it said on Thursday.The partners, who are currently co-chairs of the firm's capital markets and corporate department, will take over on Feb. 5 from current chairman Kenneth Florin. The firm said Florin decided not to seek a third term.Florin has been chair since 2018. He will continue practicing at the firm.The incoming leaders, both longtime Loeb & Loeb lawyers, said in an interview that the firm historically had a dual leadership structure with two co-chairs.The structure will allow the pair to maintain active legal practices and have coverage on both U.S. coasts, said Nussbaum, who is based in New York. Khalili resides in Los Angeles.The Los Angeles-founded firm has about 450 lawyers across eight offices in the United States and Asia.Khalili, who co-founded the firm's sports group, advises on mergers and acquisitions and other deals in the media, entertainment, technology and sports industries.Nussbaum is currently vice chairman of the firm. He represents emerging growth companies and investment banks in initial public offerings of operating companies, SPACs and other transactions.The new leaders outlined priorities as they take the helm, including getting people back to the office in the wake of the pandemic.Large law firms have been focused on enticing lawyers and staff to work in the office, citing benefits for collaboration and training, and have put in place mandates for in-person working days. Loeb has a three-day per week policy.The firm is also focused on growth in both transactional and litigation work across three departments, including technology, media, entertainment, sports and IP-centric businesses; capital markets, corporate, finance and real estate; and private client services, Nussbaum said.Jumpstart your morning with top legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket.",1980,https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/us-law-firm-loeb-loeb-elects-partner-duo-succeed-chair-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,partner news leader company resides entertainment nov elect growth emerge seek technology capital historically practice united coverage vice chairman currently real inbox back state dual offering deal medium private place outline mandate york daily coast nussbaum represent active include florin collaboration work base firm training longtime bank corporate helm arash wake maintain kenneth put business focus interview merger entice decide continue lawyer incoming operating investment public lead litigation pair law finance benefit current client straight service morning structure spacs week deliver legal docket priority transactional chair leadership mitchell group loeb estate advises department sport office day reuters khalili staff top acquisition market initial,0.9567,0.0,12.47894736842105,0.2935728250244379,0,2023-11-30
Reuters,Judge won't halt US government destruction of Texas border razor wire fencing,2023-11-30 18:14:00,Daniel Wiessner,"Nov 30 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday rejected a bid by Texas to block federal immigration authorities from destroying razor wire fencing that the state placed along the border with Mexico to deter illegal border crossings.U.S. District Judge Alia Moses in Del Rio, Texas, in a written order, criticized the Biden administration for its ""utter failure"" to prevent unlawful entry into the United States, but said Texas was unlikely to prevail on its claims that a federal policy of removing the fencing was illegal.Moses denied the state's motion to block federal officials from destroying the wire fencing pending the outcome of the state's lawsuit filed in October.The judge last month had ordered the federal government to temporarily refrain from cutting or removing the razor wire while she considered the state's motion.The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement that his office was appealing the decision.“I am disappointed that the federal government’s blatant and disturbing efforts to subvert law and order at our State’s border with Mexico will be allowed to continue,” Paxton said.The concertina wire fencing was installed on private property along the Rio Grande river by the Texas National Guard as part of Operation Lone Star, an initiative launched by Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott in 2021 aimed at deterring illegal border crossings.Paxton's lawsuit claims U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents recently stepped up an existing practice of cutting, destroying or otherwise damaging wire that the state had strategically placed with landowners' permission.On Thursday, Moses said Texas had not shown at this early stage of the case that the federal government's conduct amounted to a ""final agency action"" that can be challenged under a federal law governing rulemaking by agencies.Texas is separately defending its authority to install floating buoys in the middle of the Rio Grande to deter migrants.A federal judge at the Biden administration's request in September ordered the 1,000-foot (305-meter) barrier removed, but an appeals court allowed it to remain in place temporarily while Paxton's office pursues an appeal.Get the latest legal news of the day delivered straight to your inbox with The Afternoon Docket.",2361,https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-wont-halt-us-government-destruction-texas-border-razor-wire-fencing-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,stage news immediately greg month outcome fence cut moses lawsuit judge nov illegal administration paxton immigration united republican instal prevail practice final alia concertina inbox launch policy initiative reject state private place attorney effort grande biden utter part order block border early barrier national razor pending recently step official separately challenged justice government request late statement protection motion property guard afternoon failure buoy damage remain conduct file lone ken blatant bid temporarily general disturb remove district operation appeal exist install rio consider agent continue wire court mexico landowner refrain amount deny agency authority deter show law middle claim strategically criticize straight respond rulemaking case aim river pursues deliver legal docket prevent star defend custom disappointed september department govern thursday destroy federal office governor day action reuters subvert write texas abbott entry float unlawful,-0.98545,0.3811944091486657,13.393715710723193,0.4496666666666666,0,2023-11-30

He had pleaded not guilty.Osmond told his client James Ramsay in 2018 that the SFO had asked Osmond for information about Ramsay's involvement in the 2013 purchase of an 8 million-pound ($10.1 million) London property.He then provided a forged engagement letter to SFO investigators that falsely said he had been representing Ramsay's company – which provided a 4 million-pound loan for the purchase – since 2013.""This solicitor abused his trusted, professional status to knowingly break the law,"" Matthew Wagstaff, joint head of fraud, bribery and corruption at the SFO, said in a statement.""No one is above the law and we will pursue anyone who attempts to obstruct our investigations.""A defence lawyer for Osmond could not immediately be contacted for comment.Prosecutor James Waddington said at Osmond's trial that the SFO was investigating the loan provided by Osmond's client Ramsay as part of a wider probe involving ENRC.Former FTSE 100 company ENRC was under investigation from 2013 in relation to alleged bribery to secure mining contracts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, before the probe was dropped without any charges in August.ENRC, which is currently suing the SFO in relation to the investigation, had denied wrongdoing.Osmond, the senior partner at London-based law firm Osmond & Osmond, was asked by the SFO to provide information about Ramsay and the purchase of the London property, which was linked to the daughter of one of ENRC's founders, Waddington said.",2026,https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/british-lawyer-sentenced-tipping-off-client-about-fraud-probe-2023-11-30/,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jw0U2QGUAVScpEN8_Ik8UQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,involvement waddington partner founder money month company information conviction nov britain engagement spar attempt forgery defence currently investigate act crime republic tip bribery part order represent sentence solicitor work convict osmond firm million investigation british loan statement told property bailey watchdog hour unpaid status matthew abuse pursue charge plead letter relation london link investigator wider joint james prison trust democratic congo involve complete provide lawyer jail court contract wagstaff deny obstruct daughter head fraud law enrc follow client purchase allege proceeds ramsay senior suspend probe earlier secure laundering trial sfo falsely mining drop knowingly contact thursday professional ftse forge office corruption reuters immediately break,-0.9347,0.0,11.06363143631436,0.2916666666666667,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,Trump co-defendant in Georgia who pleaded guilty could testify in other cases,2023-11-30 13:45:00,"Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Amy Gardner","PHOENIX — Kenneth Chesebro, one of former president Donald Trump’s co-defendants in the Georgia election-interference case, plans to meet with investigators in Arizona and Nevada, where similar probes are underway, according to three individuals with knowledge of the arrangements.Chesebro, who pleaded guilty in the Georgia case to a single felony count of participating in a conspiracy to file false documents, had been charged primarily in relation to his 2020 role in organizing slates of pro-Trump state electors. Those electors met and voted in seven states where Joe Biden had won the presidential election — actions that they hoped would allow Congress to award those states’ electoral votes to Trump on Jan. 6, 2021.As part of his pleading, Chesebro avoids prison time but must testify in the case. Separately, he has also been approached by prosecutors in Arizona and Nevada, who are investigating whether the Trump slates of electors that gathered in those states broke any laws, said the individuals, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss secret or sensitive proceedings. One said that a grand jury is examining the Nevada case and that Chesebro is expected to testify in front of that panel. He plans to travel to the state this week.The offices of Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, both Democrats, are leading the respective investigations. Nevada investigators contacted a Chesebro lawyer last week to arrange a meeting, one of the individuals said; Arizona investigators plan to speak to Chesebro in the coming weeks, said two others.“They want to know the roots of the fake-elector theory,” one of the individuals said.Robert Langford, a Nevada lawyer representing Chesebro in that case, declined to confirm plans for discussions between prosecutors and his client. But he said: “My client, Kenneth Chesebro, will travel anywhere in the United States to tell the truth about what happened leading up to the events of Jan. 6, 2021.”The first public hint that Chesebro might be cooperating with other investigations came last week, when he filed a request with the Fulton County Superior Court judge overseeing the Georgia case to travel to Nevada, Arizona and D.C. Chesebro’s travel is restricted under the terms of his plea deal.“Currently, as reported in the national media, there are investigations of the ‘election fraud’ cases ongoing in Nevada, Arizona and D.C.,” Chesebro’s Georgia lawyer, Manny Arora, wrote in the request. “Mr. Chesebro needs to be able to travel to these jurisdictions in order to meet with counsel.”Spokespeople for Mayes and Ford declined to comment on the pending investigations in their respective states. One individual with knowledge of the Nevada case said the statute of limitations for filing false documents is three years, a possible charge against Trump’s electors there, so indictments would have to happen soon.The individual said Nevada officials have offered Chesebro a “proffer” agreement in which they have pledged not to charge him in exchange for truthful testimony. The person said there is no such agreement yet in Arizona and no contact at all with the office of special counsel Jack Smith in D.C., which is leading the federal election-interference case. But Chesebro wants to cooperate in both investigations, the person said.Others familiar with the Arizona case said the focus of that probe remains on Trump’s Arizona electors, not out-of-state figures who assisted the elector plan. Investigators are also probing communications by Trump allies to pressure state and local officials to subvert the outcome of the 2020 election.It’s not clear whether Smith’s team plans to approach Chesebro. Although Trump is the sole defendant in the federal case, Chesebro is one of six unindicted co-conspirators, described as “an attorney who assisted in devising and attempting to implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding.”Specifically, the federal indictment accuses Chesebro of writing memos that were sent to Trump allies in seven states laying out plans for the alternative electors to meet, vote for Trump and send electoral certificates to Washington for the purposes of being counted during the Jan. 6, 2021, joint session of Congress.“The memoranda evolved over time from a legal strategy to preserve [Trump’s] rights to a corrupt plan to subvert the federal government function by stopping Biden electors’ votes from being counted and certified,” the indictment states.A spokesman for Smith declined to comment.Individuals close to Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell, two other lawyers who helped Trump try to reverse his loss in 2020 and who accepted plea deals in the Georgia case, said they were not aware of any such conversations between Ellis or Powell and investigators outside Georgia.Chesebro was among 19 people, including Trump, originally charged in Georgia with crimes related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. A 98-page indictment secured by Atlanta-area prosecutors portrays Chesebro as central not just to the convening of alternative electors but also to the “strategy for disrupting and delaying the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.”Before his plea deal, he faced seven felony charges, including conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to file false documents, as well as violation of an anti-racketeering act originally aimed at dismantling organized crime groups. As part of his plea, Fulton County prosecutors interviewed Chesebro for nearly three hours, and he agreed to turn over emails and other documents.",5663,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/30/kenneth-chesebro-georgia-arizona-nevada/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,strategy outcome organize grand sole certification conspiracy possible testify loss gather corrupt forgery united convene role ongoing investigate oversee year spokespeople clear act deal medium result alternative attorney originally agreement panel part turn represent order include arizona certify hint underway spokesman close pending fulton government request pledge spoke mr familiar team respective hour ally time election count hop implement focus investigator joint plan evolve prosecutor delay electoral accord interviewed court filing obstruct sensitive reverse report discus arrange meet secret mayes client accuses testimony donald proffer aware aim defendant indictment probe single truth secure approach event document meeting contact happen congress office democrat limitation action jury subvert false slate plea write session anonymity email jenna knowledge broke truthful expect judge sidney lay unindicted award pressure attempt central stop joe violation chesebro currently preserve similar state remains function crime primarily overturn phoenix effort comment biden president person specifically discussion memo send front washington offer kris georgia elector related national examine exchange official devise disrupt superior separately investigation figure memoranda accepted travel conversation communication vote file agree kenneth charge plead relation guilty purpose general assist trump jurisdiction former prison powell dismantle lawyer portrays statute langford public lead special decline avoids aaron cooperate fraud law elli theory commit fraudulent described county case term ford week submit legal local felony restrict group individual manny counsel jack nevada proceeding confirm federal condition arora smith speak root certificate presidential participate,-0.7294499999999999,0.2119018188239448,11.826919999999998,0.4436676798378925,0,2023-11-30
Washington Post,N.Y. appeals court reinstates Trump gag order in civil fraud case,2023-11-30 12:46:00,Shayna Jacobs,"NEW YORK — A New York appeals court on Thursday reinstated a limited gag order on Donald Trump, preventing him from making public comments about the law clerk in a civil business fraud case brought by the state.The court in a two-page decision upheld New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron’s set of orders that prevented Trump and his defense team from mentioning the clerk, who has been the subject of anti-Semitic and other threats and messages since the case began.Engoron imposed a gag order on the former president for comments about the clerk that he believed endangered the clerk’s safety. The order was issued after a day Trump posted a photo of the employee on social media that the judge said led to threats.The judge has fined Trump twice for a total of $15,000 for violating the gag order.Trump’s side has repeatedly accused the clerk of bias and having an inappropriate influence on Engoron’s decision-making.A temporary pause on the gag order issued Nov. 16 gave Trump two-week window in which to discuss the clerk publicly. That day, he resumed his complaints and accusations against her on social media.The civil fraud case stems from New York Attorney General Letitia James’s $250 million lawsuit against Trump, his company and several current and former executives including Trump’s adult sons. The Trumps and their lawyers have denied any wrongdoing.On Thursday, Engoron said he would decide the case in January. The trial began Oct. 2 and may continue into mid-December.Trump lawyer Christopher Kise on Thursday said the gag order ruling amounted to a “tragic day for the rule of law.”He and the rest of Trump’s legal team have said it is their duty to call out courtroom unfairness when they see it and that the gag order prohibits Trump’s right to free speech and seeks to influence next year’s presidential election.",1846,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/30/trump-new-york-fraud-gag-order/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bias rule company subject threat post judge lawsuit social seek brought adult make believe year limited medium safety attorney civil york comment repeatedly president inappropriate begin stem order engoron include gag violate impose clerk upheld employee million supreme justice influence christopher publicly team election give accusation business mention unfairness tragic general trump james former appeal total decide message continue complaint lawyer court call amount executive public deny lead side prohibits january rest fraud law discus arthur defense current temporary donald pause case duty decision legal issue courtroom prevent letitia set trial ruling fin thursday free accuse day photo resume reinstate endanger window speech presidential,-0.94125,0.1625135427952329,10.39764705882353,0.311815358554489,0,2023-11-30
Politico,"India implicated in New York assassination plot, prosecutors say",2023-11-29 17:59:00,Associated Press,"NEW YORK — An Indian government official directed a plot to assassinate a prominent Sikh separatist leader living in New York City, U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday as they announced charges against a man they said was part of the thwarted murder conspiracy.U.S. officials became aware last spring of the plot to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who advocated for the creation of a sovereign Sikh state and is considered a terrorist by the Indian government.The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration interceded and set up a sting, with an undercover agent posing as a hitman, after the conspirators recruited an international narcotics trafficker in the plot to murder the activist for $100,000.The Indian government official was not charged or identified by name in an indictment unsealed Wednesday but was described as a “senior field officer” with responsibilities in “security management” and “intelligence” said to have previously served in India’s Central Reserve Police Force.The charges were aimed at a different person, Nikhil Gupta, 52, a citizen of India who was accused of murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire. The charges carry a potential penalty of up to 20 years in prison.“The defendant conspired from India to assassinate, right here in New York City, a U.S. citizen of Indian origin who has publicly advocated for the establishment of a sovereign state for Sikhs, an ethnoreligious minority group in India,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, the chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan, said in a news release.“We will not tolerate efforts to assassinate U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, and stand ready to investigate, thwart, and prosecute anyone who seeks to harm and silence Americans here or abroad,” he added.The charges were the second major recent accusation of complicity of Indian government officials in attempts to kill Sikh separatist figures living in North America.In September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were credible allegations that the Indian government had links to the assassination in that country of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India rejected the accusation as absurd, but Canada expelled a top Indian diplomat and India responded with the same measure.Before the U.S. indictment was unsealed Wednesday, India announced it had set up a high-level inquiry after U.S. authorities raised concerns with New Delhi that its government may have had knowledge of the plot to kill Pannun.The U.S. side shared some information and India “takes such inputs seriously since they impinge on our national security interests as well, and relevant departments were already examining the issue,” a statement by External Affairs Ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said.Gupta was arrested June 30 in the Czech Republic through a bilateral extradition treaty between the U.S. and the Czech Republic, prosecutors said. It was not immediately clear when he might be brought to the United States and whether he has secured legal representation in the United States.The case is particularly sensitive given the high priority President Joe Biden has placed on improving ties with India and courting it to be a major partner in the push to counter China’s increasing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.The White House declined to comment directly on the charges against Gupta, but said administration officials acted quickly.“When we were made aware of the fact that the defendant in this case had credibly indicated that he was directed to arrange the murder by an individual who is assessed to be an employee of the Indian Government, we took this information very seriously and engaged in direct conversations with the Indian government at the highest levels to express our concern,” White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement.Trudeau said in a statement that Canadian authorities had been working closely with American officials since August.“The news coming out of the United States further underscores what we’ve been talking about since the very beginning which is that India needs to take this seriously, the Indian government needs to work with us,” he said.Pannun has been a leading organizer of the so-called Khalistan referendum, inviting Sikhs worldwide to vote on whether India’s Punjab state should become an independent nation based on religion. Organizers of the nonbinding referendum hope to present the results to the U.N. General Assembly in about two years. He is also general counsel with the Sikhs for Justice organization, which was banned by India in 2019.“I’m not afraid of the physical death,” Pannun said in a telephone interview Wednesday with The Associated Press.If his death is the cost of running a campaign to organize the voting in Khalistan on whether Indian governed Punjab should be an independent country, “I’m willing to pay that price,” he said.“We have never incited, provoked or promoted violence as a means to achieve any political goal,” Pannun said.“India has proved they believe in violence and bullets to stop” the campaign, he said, referring also to the assassination of Nijjar in Canada.The indictment said Gupta was recruited last May by the unidentified Indian government employee to orchestrate the assassination of Pannun, who was only identified in court papers as the “Victim.”Gupta contacted a criminal associate to help find a hitman to carry out the killing, but that person happened to be a confidential source working with the DEA. The confidential source then introduced Gupta to a purported hitman, who was actually a DEA agent, the indictment said.In June, the Indian government employee gave Gupta the home address of Pannun, his phone numbers and details about his daily conduct, including surveillance photographs, which Gupta then passed along to the undercover DEA agent, the indictment said.It said Gupta directed the undercover agent to carry out the murder as soon as possible, but also warned the agent not to commit the killing around the time of anticipated engagements between high-level U.S. and Indian officials.According to the indictment, Gupta told the undercover DEA agent the day after Nijjar’s murder in Canada that Nijjar “was also the target” and “we have so many targets.”He added that in light of Nijjar’s murder, there was “now no need to wait” in carrying out the New York assassination, the indictment said. Later, the Indian government official behind the New York assassination plot sent Gupta a news article about the New York assassination target and messaged Gupta saying his killed was a “priority now,” the indictment said.The White House first became aware of the plot in late July, according to a senior administration official.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive exchanges with Indian government, said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, and underscored that India needed to investigate and hold those responsible accountable.Sullivan also made clear that U.S. needed an assurance that this would not happen again and warned that another episode could permanently damage the trust established between our two countries, the official said.Biden then asked CIA Director William Burns to contact his counterpart and travel to India to make it clear that the United States would not tolerate such activities and that his administration expected accountability.Biden also raised the matter directly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi when they met at the Group of 20 Summit in September in New Delhi.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Sullivan raised the issue with Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar when he visited Washington in September around the time of the annual U.N.

Washington Post,Top U.S. intelligence officials demanded India probe assassination plot,2023-11-29 05:24:00,"Ellen Nakashima, Gerry Shih, Amanda Coletta","The discovery of a plot to assassinate a Sikh separatist on U.S. soil earlier this year so concerned the Biden administration that it dispatched its top two intelligence officials to New Delhi to demand the Indian government investigate and hold to account those responsible, senior administration officials said.CIA Director William J. Burns flew to India in August and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines followed in October, said the officials, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.On Wednesday, federal prosecutors expect to file a new indictment against an Indian national charged in June with paying a hit man to kill the Sikh separatist, who is both a U.S. and Canadian citizen, according to people familiar with the matter.The charges against Nikhil Gupta, which will be lodged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, relate to a murder-for-hire plot targeting Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, general counsel for the New York-based Sikhs for Justice, a group that advocates the creation of an independent Sikh state called Khalistan within India. Gupta allegedly conspired with a number of others, at least one of whom is believed to be an official in India, the people said.The scheme was foiled in June by the Drug Enforcement Administration, shortly after a Sikh separatist in Canada was assassinated. In a bombshell announcement in September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” that New Delhi was behind the killing. U.S. law enforcement is working closely with counterparts in Canada on both matters, officials said.The charges against Gupta, who is not in the United States, will build on a bare-bones indictment, filed in mid-June and unsealed in July, which alleged that Gupta coordinated a $15,000 advance payment to a purported hit man’s associate, according to the people familiar with the matter. That document gives no indication of who the intended victim was; additional details will be contained in what is known as a superseding indictment.The Justice Department declined to comment. In a statement Wednesday, an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Arindam Bagchi, said that India “takes … seriously” the information provided by the United States and earlier this month set up a “high-level inquiry committee” to investigate. It did not confirm or deny the existence of any assassination plot or Indian government involvement.The thwarting of the assassination attempt and existence of an indictment was first reported by the Financial Times.The administration learned of the foiled plot in late July, triggering a concerted effort to raise the matter with senior Indian government officials. In early August, national security adviser Jake Sullivan brought his concerns to his counterpart, Ajit Doval, in person during a meeting in another country in the region.“He underscored that India needed to investigate [the plot] and hold those responsible, accountable, and that the United States needed an assurance that this would not happen again,” said a senior administration official.Within a week of Sullivan’s meeting, Burns flew to India to deliver the same message to his counterpart, Ravi Sinha. President Biden himself, in a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Group of 20 summit in September, stressed the seriousness of the issue “and the potential repercussions for the bilateral relationship were similar threats to persist,” the official said.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Sullivan raised the issue again when Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar visited Washington in September after attending the U.N. General Assembly. And in October, Haines went to India to share information about the plot with the government to aid its probe, officials said.“Indian counterparts expressed surprise and concern” when confronted by the allegations, National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said last week, when the news of the foiled plan broke. “They stated that activity of this nature was not their policy.”Activists and some U.S. lawmakers have become increasingly concerned about what they see as an audacious campaign of transnational repression by India of Sikh separatists in North America.In September, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the American Sikh Congressional Caucus, posted on X that “I’m concerned by reports that India’s government is targeting Sikh activists abroad” and pledged to work with local and federal officials to ensure actions are taken to protect the Sikh community.Although there is little evidence of widespread pro-separatist sentiment within Punjab, the Indian state that is home to the majority of the world’s Sikhs, Modi’s government has frequently alleged that Sikh extremists supported by Pakistan have fomented unrest and carried out terrorist attacks inside India.These alleged militants, the Indian government argues, have been harbored by Canada and the United States despite repeated attempts by India to bring them to justice.In a statement to The Washington Post, Pannun claimed “India wants to kill me for running the Khalistan referendum campaign.” He called the thwarted attempt on his life “an act of transnational terrorism,” which is a challenge to … U.S. sovereignty and [a] threat to freedom of speech and democracy.”The filing of new charges could complicate the Biden administration’s efforts to deepen strategic ties with India as a counterweight to China. But some analysts say that Washington’s geopolitical courtship of New Delhi supersedes the concerns it has — at least for now — about the Indian government’s crackdown on Sikhs and other minorities and Modi’s tilt toward illiberalism.“There’s little to be gained diplomatically from attempting to shame this Indian government and lots to lose,” said Daniel Markey, a senior adviser on South Asia at the United States Institute of Peace. The relationship is fundamentally one of shared interests — such as countering China — not shared values, he said. Emphasizing the latter “forces the administration to answer questions that are increasingly uncomfortable.”But administration officials say they will continue to balance U.S. interests and values.“India is an important strategic partner of ours and we are continuing to pursue the agenda to expand our cooperation,” said a second senior administration official. “At the same time, this is a serious matter. And as partners, we expect the Indian government to stop any such activities in the United States and to cooperate with us as these investigations proceed.”The new charges will deepen scrutiny of Modi’s government and its spy service in the wake of Trudeau’s disclosure that he possessed “credible evidence” of New Delhi’s involvement in the assassination of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India called the allegations “absurd” and demanded evidence. Canada said it furnished proof, but has declined to make it public. Ottawa expelled the station chief for India’s foreign intelligence service, Pawan Kumar Rai, leading India to retaliate by expelling a Canadian intelligence officer and forcing the removal of dozens of diplomats.The Indian government has pressured Western countries to crack down on the movement after supporters of an independent Sikh state stormed India’s embassy in London and attacked its consulate in San Francisco this year, say Western diplomats in New Delhi.Canada is home to the world’s largest Sikh population outside India, and leaders of the Sikh community for decades have claimed that the Indian government and its intelligence apparatus are seeking to target dissidents on Canadian soil with impunity.Balpreet Singh Boparai, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization of Canada, said he is aware of at least five Sikh advocates, including Nijjar, who have been warned by Canadian authorities about unspecified threats to their safety both before and after Nijjar’s killing.Moninder Singh, a friend of Nijjar, said Nijjar was visited by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in July 2022. Then in June of this year, he said, Nijjar was scheduled to meet with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. But a few days before that meeting, on the evening of June 18, he was gunned down outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a suburb of Vancouver.One day after Nijjar’s slaying, Bobby Singh, a Sikh youth activist in Sacramento, received a call from an FBI agent advising him to take safety measures, including avoiding public places. When asked where the threat was coming from, the agent told him “we can’t tell you,” he recalled.Two days later, a threatening text message popped on his iPhone at 1:41 a.m. It said: “Just a head up for you. You’re next in the USA. We have all tools ready to come fix the problems.”It closed: “Jai hind” — or “Victory to India.”That day, Modi was welcomed to Washington by Biden for a lavish state visit intended to showcase the two nations’ burgeoning ties. The following day, Amarjit Singh, a Sikh nationalist from New York, joined a protest in front of the White House over mounting human rights concerns under Modi. Inside the White House, Modi and Biden were meeting.As he drove back to New York, he recalled, he received a call on his cellphone. It was an FBI agent warning him of a threat to his life. Singh, who runs a 24-hour news channel on YouTube for the global Punjabi community, said he had planned to fly to Canada to attend a “final prayer” service for Nijjar, a Sikh funeral tradition. Instead, for several months, he restricted his travel.",9594,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/29/india-us-assassination-plot-sikh-pannun/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story involvement news partner boparai express leader bilateral antony asia nation harbor canadian creation sentiment channel south peace demand shame argues tool inside blinken investigate burn important retaliate back purport analyst accountable unrest affair jai close north justice tilt government expand late announcement statement pledge familiar separatist detail time emphasize surprise citizen youth london extremist officer foil plan embassy unspecified agent hardeep message provide security ensure call concert filing community diplomatically agenda report flew meet associate protest lose external additional stress tie october trudeau organization china probe welcome dispatch issue advise prayer singh existence repeat drove transnational attack mount measure activist happen referendum pay intend iphone usa enforcement question wednesday challenge majority speech repercussion lodge scrutiny ready broke foreign expect text allegedly fly burgeon terrorism seek interest foment brought stop payment arindam crackdown believe victim supersedes adviser conspire indian large absurd effort campaign target allegation comment biden york inquiry protect raise watson early nijjar front relationship potential swalwell official house punjabi markey manhattan director travel temple told council movement khalistan nationalist terrorist confront despite justin give pursue charge minister cooperation eric sovereignty tradition prime spokeswoman adrienne youtube build storm plot visit courtship answer head account expel bagchi popped follow decade kill avoid assembly earlier white deliver local value join group chief counterweight strategic september indication lawmaker federal warn widespread support jake top hind apparatus india sinha run minority information activity threat post complicate administration nature united final american audacious increasingly supersede make furnish doval year canada matter act freedom dissident safety geopolitical ministry william coordinate include rai spokesman lavish underscored daniel sullivan spoke evidence hit cellphone gurpatwant western removal wake gun home scheme pakistan prosecutor balance diplomat accord trigger proof continue responsible counterpart interviewed threaten suburb slay intelligence deny institute share claimed sacramento narendra punjab possess allege jaishankar supporter aware service indictment dozen independent san set caucus ottawa august document meeting funeral learn crack action x gupta francisco kumar number abroad anonymity bring consulate month seriousness surrey station population amarjit receive thwart instead schedule counter pressure attempt pannun persist assassinate ajit credible concerned contain assassination attend country summit similar force bobby state place discovery fundamentally advocate unsealed president delhi relate person global washington spy national work june avril militant life assurance investigation shortly haines fix showcase hold police victory carry file recall ravi closely pawan sikh friend general aid fbi committee bombshell repression july royal world financial latter public lead authority decline member cooperate nikhil law lot disclosure senior modi week legal restrict concern advance deepen congressional soil counsel department frequently confirm human day condition,-0.8063,0.156347717323327,11.19015028901734,0.3302287581699346,0,2023-11-29
NPR,It's peak shopping — and shoplifting — season. Cops are stepping up antitheft tactics,2023-11-29 05:01:00,Martin Kaste,"""There's definitely been some progress made,"" says Tony Sheppard, vice president of retail risk solutions for ThinkLP. He's worked in the industry for decades, starting out as a store detective at Montgomery Ward. He sees new energy in law enforcement efforts to combat this type of theft. ""The INFORM act passed,"" he says, referring to a new federal law requiring platforms such as Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp to collect more information about high-volume sellers — and help identify those who are fencing stolen merchandise. Sheppard is also cheered by states that have started interagency task forces to track organized retail crime rings. California, especially, has ramped up its spending on such investigations, supported by the California Highway Patrol. ""I'd like to think that we can hopefully start getting back to normal,"" says CHP Capt. Jeff Loftin, with the organized retail crime task force in the Los Angeles area. His group has doubled in size in the past couple of years. ""Shoplifting is always going to be a thing, but hopefully it won't be so brazen, where people feel comfortable."" Many in law enforcement believe retail theft has been driven partly by a sense of impunity, fed by videos of people walking out of stores with piles of merchandise while staff look on. They also blame the pandemic, when many jurisdictions were less likely to jail suspects for property crimes. ""What they're trying to do now is, they're putting the word out,"" says Sgt. Casey Hiam of the police department in Bellevue, Wash. It's a shopping-rich suburb near Seattle, where officers do stakeouts near stores with chronic shoplifting problems. Bellevue police Sgt. Casey Hiam says he hoped these shoplifting stakeouts send a message to would-be criminals that ""Well, don't go to Bellevue, because they're proactively out there, and if you get caught you are going to jail, even if you do steal just a pair of shoes."" Martin Kaste/NPR hide caption Bellevue police Sgt. Casey Hiam says he hoped these shoplifting stakeouts send a message to would-be criminals that ""Well, don't go to Bellevue, because they're proactively out there, and if you get caught you are going to jail, even if you do steal just a pair of shoes."" They lurk in unmarked police cars — the Toyota ""dad mobile"" minivan is especially deceptive — and wait for texts from the loss prevention staff inside stores. The staff tell the cops when they're watching someone, and if that person walks out without paying, they text the word ""green."" ""Yup — and he's green,"" Hiam says, radio beeping, when the cops get the signal during a recent four-hour mall stakeout. ""All right, we're green on this guy as he comes out. Going towards Panera!"" They catch a small man in droopy jeans suspected of stealing a pair of white Nikes. He gives up meekly — he has a police record — and is cuffed and sent off to be booked. ""This type of [operation] is like duck-hunting,"" Hiam says. Cops have to sit patiently and wait for a few thieves to come to them. ""It's labor-intensive and time-consuming,"" he adds, and police can't do these staeouts more than a couple times a week. But it's also the only sure-fire way to have an officer on the spot the moment someone steals something. ""Humans talk about experiences, criminals talk about experiences,"" Hiam says, ""and hopefully they're communicating back to each other that, 'Well, don't go to Bellevue because they're proactively out there, and if you get caught, you are going to jail, even if you do steal just a pair of shoes.' "" Despite the andecdotal sense that retail theft has grown worse in recent years, hard numbers are elusive. One reason for this is that stores vary widely in how they respond to theft — and whether they report it at all. Hiam recalls conversations he's had with store managers who've asked police for stakeout operations. Employees picket a Macy's store in Tukwila, Wash., demanding higher pay and more security against retail thieves. Martin Kaste/NPR hide caption Employees picket a Macy's store in Tukwila, Wash., demanding higher pay and more security against retail thieves. ""I'm like, 'You haven't called the police in three months, and you're saying you're getting pillaged all the time, but I don't have any case reports for you guys!'"" he says. ""So how can I go and pay attention to your parking lot or your store if you're not calling us?"" While police reports are spotty, the National Retail Federation's annual survey suggests store managers think the problem has become worse. Some 78% of respondents said organized retail crime was more of a priority for them this year than last; about 69% said the same of other kinds of ""external"" theft. The more complicated question is, who's responsible? While retail groups point to understaffed police departments that are less able to respond to property crimes, police say retailers could do more to protect their inventory. For instance, they should stop putting popular items near entrances, especially during Black Friday. A growing number of stores also discourage their staffs from stopping the thieves. More than 41% of companies in the NRF survey said no employees in their stores are allowed to stop or apprehend shoplifters. The reason for this is usually a fear of the violence and liability that could come from such confrontations. Stores have the option of spending more money on trained security, but guards are expensive and off-duty police are even more so. Some retailers have decided the stolen merchandise would cost them less in the long run. Workers at Macy's stores in the Seattle area see this equation somewhat differently. They went on a brief strike last week, demanding higher pay and more security guards. ""We have these 'Chanel girls' that come in and steal thousands of dollars in Chanel,"" says Jeanne Peterson, who works at the fragrance counter at the Southcenter Macy's, near Seattle. ""They will show their pepper spray or they will spray you. What we've been trained to do is to let them come behind the counter and let them take what they want to take."" Some employees who went on strike want more armed guards, especially in the more isolated corners of the store, and some say they're angry at Macy's for disciplining employees who've tried to resist thieves or call the police. In a statement to NPR, Macy says, in part, that ""our top priority is to ensure the safety of our colleagues and customers in-store."" But Kathy Henderson says that's not how it feels for salespeople like her. She says Macy's suspended her because she briefly pulled back on a box of perfume when a shoplifter tried to take it. Asked why she should care whether someone gets away with the company's merchandise, she says it's because it's just so hard to live with, day after day. ""It's total anxiety,"" Henderson says. ""If we hear a loud noise or if there's a whole bunch of people talking loud or whatever, it's like PTSD.""",6927,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215568143/its-peak-shopping-and-shoplifting-season-cops-are-stepping-up-antitheft-tactics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point discourage liability understaffed run company strike fence organize information pass mobile widely complicate customer item retailer type double moment pile proactively jean pandemic loss montgomery demand offerup inside patrol vice worker make caught thinklp year wait expensive back act feel green safety industry tukwila fear instance part minivan mall small brazen definitely platform picket employee facebook retail statement guard property grown perfume violence pull martin reason california time toyota meekly chp walk especially hop steal partly hiam elusive officer sgt operation sheppard prevention train differently start long decide message responsible macy security angeles casey ensure suburb call chanel pair theft inform capt report external beep catch isolated past salesperson entrance droopy ward signal unmarked cheer priority energy task interagency spot jeanne spotty fed loud pay talk ptsd southcenter size enforcement patiently question andecdotal record number cop anxiety money month hear npr collect couple text arm manager colleague federation driven high criminal girl counter combat seller guy shoe cost stop track resist believe away solution option force stakeout state spray book crime kathy communicate hard require effort suspect radio tony president kind detective person survey send protect shoplifter popular wash panera pillage work national corner fragrance add shoplift investigation deceptive identify pepper henderson cuffed conversation ramped friday annual police bellevue recall despite loftin box give put nike live experience suggests peterson spending attention normal jurisdiction briefly risk blame refer total equation ring respondent highway jail word lurk staeouts noise show parking video car law black store apprehend merchandise marketplace decade lot angry dad caption problem respond case grow suspend progress week white confrontation hide jeff group thousand department chronic recent thief nrf comfortable area federal seattle human day bunch staff support discipline top vary impunity dollar watch inventory,-0.9777,0.0433087916847119,7.188185053380785,0.4518559984077224,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,Senate intelligence chairman proposes revamp of surveillance program,2023-11-28 20:22:00,"Ellen Nakashima, Tim Starks, Marianna Sotomayor","With the clock ticking toward an end-of-year deadline, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday introduced a bipartisan bill aimed at renewing a powerful but controversial surveillance program — known as Section 702 — that he hopes addresses concerns from fiercely skeptical privacy-minded lawmakers on both ends of the political spectrum without sapping the tool’s usefulness.The bill sponsored by Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), drafted with input from the Biden administration as well as both leaders of the House Intelligence Committee, would restrict some FBI authority. But in a nod to the spy agencies, it does not go so far as to introduce a requirement that agents obtain a warrant laying out the probable cause to query digital communications, such as emails collected by the National Security Agency for information on U.S. citizens and others legally in the country. National security officials say requiring such a warrant would be an unacceptable limitation because of how much it would gum up vital queries, but civil liberties groups insist it is necessary to protect Americans.Section 702 is a workhorse surveillance program by which the NSA gathers emails, text messages and the like from U.S.-based tech companies in which a foreigner based overseas is on at least one end of the communication. A small subset of the take is furnished to the FBI for potential use in national security investigations involving espionage, counterterrorism and cyberthreats, officials said.Data gathered under 702 has been used to stop foreign plots to kill Americans on U.S. soil, prevent cyberattacks and recover ransoms paid by victims of ransomware attacks, officials have said.One of the controversies around the program has been the FBI’s querying of the 702 information for evidence on Americans, people legally in the United States and U.S. companies for use in criminal investigations. Critics call those “backdoor” searches, and civil liberties advocates fear that the FBI will search its 702 database for evidence in domestic crimes that have nothing to do with national security — such as child sexual abuse material and certain forms of wire fraud.Warner’s proposal bans FBI agents from querying the database for evidence of a crime — unless it is to prevent loss of life, serious bodily injury or a cyberattack on critical infrastructure.The FBI has used the authority only nine times in a criminal prosecution, and all were counterterrorism cases, officials have said.“I think that the compromise product that we’ve got is pretty darn good, and it pushes the administration further than I think they want to go, but that’s what they can live with,” Warner told The Washington Post. “So we’re actually in a pretty decent spot there.”Warner’s bill is co-sponsored by the intelligence committee’s top Republican, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), as well as the Senate Judiciary Committee’s top Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and several other senators. It comes in the wake of a campaign by the Biden administration to get Congress to act, citing the importance of Section 702 intelligence powers.“Roughly two-thirds of the articles in the president’s daily brief comes from 702 information collected by the NSA, CIA, FBI and [National Counterterrorism Center],” said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House. “Imagine if this authority lapses, suddenly depriving two-thirds of those articles of intelligence important enough that it makes it in currently to the PDB — that would be a real step backward.”The official said the administration was still studying the final version of the Warner bill but was grateful for the work to produce the legislation, and called it “an important marker that there’s a bill introduced by this bipartisan coalition. It’s at least something very concrete for us to take a look at.”Still, civil liberties groups have signaled that they’re not satisfied by the proposal.The Warner legislation’s proposed change on criminal investigations, said Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, “isn’t much of a reform … because the vast majority of the backdoor searches that do occur are done for foreign intelligence purposes.”“Pretty much all the stories of abuse we’ve seen were from queries done from foreign intelligence purposes,” he said, adding that the bill “makes mostly cosmetic changes and doesn’t actually get at the underlying problems we’ve seen with Section 702.”Critics of the bill also say it would expand Section 702 surveillance in some ways, such as by letting a search subject — or authorized third party — consent to it. That and other provisions make the bill a “wolf in sheep’s clothing,” said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty & National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.The challenge going forward, Warner said, “is the House and Chairman Jordan, and what he’s going to do,” Warner said, referring to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who leads the House Judiciary Committee and is a leader of the House Freedom Caucus. Jordan has suggested that Congress should perhaps get the FBI out of the Section 702 process entirely, and has indicated that he likes many aspects of rival legislation that would institute a warrant requirement for queries currently covered under 702.Jordan’s office declined to comment.House Republican leaders have discussed possibly tying Section 702 reauthorization to the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual defense policy bill that has passed for the last 62 years, since both must be addressed before the end of the year. However, a GOP leadership aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private and ongoing conversations shot down the idea that Warner’s proposal would be the one specifically tied to the defense policy legislation and said that no decision has been made on tying the two issues together.Since assuming the House speakership, Mike Johnson (R-La.) has been holding conversations with leaders in both chambers and committee chairs charged with writing legislation on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, under which Section 702 falls. But GOP leaders have yet to fully take the temperature of the conference about the issue and what proposals a majority of them would accept. Moreover, Johnson has pledged to the far-right that he will hold votes only on single-subject bills, rather than tying or packaging proposals together.The House Freedom Caucus and other far-right members of the Republican conference have long telegraphed that a FISA overhaul would be a fight, especially when it comes to changing Section 702. Hard-right lawmakers have been at the forefront of pushing to defund the FBI, claiming that the bureau and the Justice Department have been weaponized against civilians. Tying Warner’s proposal to the NDAA would probably cause a revolt among the membership, though the Freedom Caucus has not voted to take an official position on the matter.Johnson has a four-vote margin to work with — soon to be three, if Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) is expelled by week’s end — making it incredibly difficult to pass any legislation with just Republican consensus. The Freedom Caucus has already rebelled against Johnson’s decision to rely on Democratic support to fund the government until early this year by sinking a procedural hurdle blocking consideration of other legislation. Some of their members have suggested publicly doing so again if Johnson chooses to pass legislation with broad Democratic and Republican support.",7668,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/11/28/section-702-fisa-surveillance-program/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story consent leader tick company version information accept pass rival program post ransomware liberty administration draft shot union loss gather cyberthreats consideration united tool final american gop ongoing center make real furnish forward important fisa year recover authorize vast digital act freedom fear sheep query small political ground assume civilian change justice government expand johnson pledge spoke evidence aide form wake spectrum time especially george insist citizen propose coalition democratic ban imagine agent paid long involve message security skeptical chooses sinking proposal intelligence call address fully input sexual foreigner agency institute prosecution warrant discus renew claim darn tie entirely surveillance aim decision probably issue signal grateful warner lapse controversy cosmetic hurdle set caucus workhorse forefront search spot attack idea judiciary reauthorization underlie congress office concrete limitation provision section write challenge majority suggest fall chamber domestic university bipartisan tech anonymity email conference rule legislation espionage broad collect subject foreign text kia produce criminal suddenly difficult lay rebel republican stop graham controversial indicate importance chairman party overseas currently rely obtain rubio vital occur victim policy bodily country school state bill database crime compromise fiercely require private civil campaign york biden daily advocate ransom president specifically block legally protect spy early washington national work potential base critic marker life step add official house probable investigation backdoor temperature powerful incredibly jordan margin director santos told mark membership conversation communication cover wolf speakership publicly brennan cyberattacks satisfied vote annual ndaa hold roughly pdb gum abuse charge child live purpose fbi committee elizabeth deprive injury pretty refer introduce discuss wire hamadanchy senate requirement cyberattack plot reform lindsey packaging cia procedural product authority lead decline sponsor nsa member counterterrorism weaponize clothing telegraph expel deadline aspect defense kill overhaul decent tuesday problem case possibly senior authorization critical week white unacceptable restrict prevent concern chair leadership marco group revolt soil hope goitein consensus counsel department clock defund nod lawmaker position process fight senator subset study condition mike bureau article support top material push fund,0.0211999999999999,0.1173708920187793,11.324554024655548,0.4809885833121127,0,2023-11-28
NPR,Alex Murdaugh's financial fraud victims confront him in court before his sentencing,2023-11-28 17:47:00,The Associated Press,"For years, South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh looked his anguished clients in the eyes and promised to help them with their medical bills, their suffering or simply to survive. Then he stole some, if not all, of what he won for many of them. Those clients got to look Murdaugh in the eye Tuesday and tell him how he had destroyed their trust, as the disgraced lawyer was sentenced to 27 years in prison for stealing about $12 million. ""I'm not crying for what he stole from me. I'm crying for what he did to everybody,"" said Jordan Jinks, a friend of Murdaugh's since childhood. The courtroom drama marked yet another step in the fall of a powerful and respected attorney whose family name dominated the legal scene in a small Hampton County for generations, and whose alleged crimes have been a perennial topic of true crime podcasts and online chat groups. In court in an orange prison jumpsuit, Murdaugh listened as the victims recounted how the man with a commanding presence and seductive Southern charm had duped them. Jinks went to Murdaugh after incurring hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills for a neck injury he got when someone rear-ended his car. Jinks paid the bills in advance, having been assured by Murdaugh that he would obtain a settlement to pay him back. Murdaugh got the money, but kept it himself, financially ruining his friend. ""The money you stole from me, I would have gave it to you,"" Jinks said. ""Why bro? Why?"" State prosecutors and defense lawyers negotiated the 27-year prison sentence for Murdaugh, who is already serving a life term without parole after a jury found him guilty of killing his wife, Maggie, with a rifle, and younger son, Paul, with a shotgun in June 2021. Judge Clifton Newman, who also presided over the murder trial, accepted it. Murdaugh adamantly denies killing his family members. His lawyers are seeking a new trial, citing allegations that the court clerk tampered with the jury. A different judge will decide whether to grant Murdaugh a hearing in which jurors, the clerk, and maybe even Newman, could be questioned under oath. The sentence for Murdaugh's financial crimes is a kind of insurance policy to prevent his release if his murder conviction is overturned. Under South Carolina law, Murdaugh will have to serve almost 23 years of the sentence, even if he is a model prisoner. He would be 76 before he could be released. Murdaugh had to give up his rights to appeal as part of the deal. Newman said Tuesday that Murdaugh had the emptiest soul of anyone he has seen in his 23 years on the bench, with the exception of a man who was sentenced to death for killing an off-duty police officer and burning his body. ""The question was asked: What kind of animal are you?"" Newman said, referring to additional comments Jinks made during his testimony. ""You are an enigmatic person. I don't think you understand yourself."" For his part, Murdaugh spent nearly 45 minutes apologizing to his family for bringing them shame and dishonor, and addressing all his victims, although he did not cry as much as he did when he testified in his own defense during his murder trial. ""I want each of you who spoke to know I listened to you. I heard you. Your pain and hurt is palpable. ... I promise you it resonates with me,"" Murdaugh said. Prosecutor Creighton Waters of the state Attorney General's Office opened Tuesday's hearing with a detailed account of all of Murdaugh's thefts and how he moved around the more than $12 million he stole to avoid detection for nearly 10 years. He ended more than an hour later with the precise figure: $12,425,254.32. His clients trusted Murdaugh and he used ""the trust of his family name and the law license on that wall"" to keep stealing to pay off loans and credit card bills, never catching up to bad investments and heavy spending, Waters said. Prosecutors initially charged Murdaugh with 101 financial crimes, including breach of trust, money laundering and tax evasion, involving 18 victims. Under the plea deal, the number was reduced to 22 crimes against each of his clients. His victims include Gloria Satterfield, the longtime family maid who died in a fall at the Murdaugh home. Murdaugh put his arm around Satterfield's son at her funeral and promised he would take care of her family. He got about $4 million from his insurers then later admitted to stealing every penny. Satterfield's son Tony said he prays for Murdaugh and forgives him, but can't forget how he was treated. ""I really don't have the words. You lied, you cheated, you stole. You betrayed me and my family,"" he said. Sandra Taylor was killed in a crash with a drunken driver, leaving behind three children. Murdaugh told her estate he could only get a $30,000 settlement. He took $150,000 himself, prosecutors said. ""They lost a mother. And you stole every dime from them. Do you not have a soul?"" asked Satterfield's sister Ginger Hadwin. Tuesday's hearing did not mark the end of Murdaugh's legal problems. He also is awaiting sentencing on federal financial crime charges, and still faces insurance fraud and other local charges after asking a friend to kill him in September 2021 so his surviving son could get $10 million in life insurance. The shot only grazed Murdaugh's head. In his speech Tuesday, Murdaugh again blamed his drug addiction to painkillers for all the thefts. He gave detailed apologies to his surviving son, his family, his in-laws and his law partners. He told any of his victims they were welcome to visit him behind bars. ""I hope that in time that each of you will be willing to talk to me,"" Murdaugh said. ""I would like as time moves on to continue to reiterate just how sorry I am and how important it is to me that you know that."" After the speech, Waters told the judge — just as he did before sentencing at the murder trial — that Murdaugh could lie and conjure up false sincerity like no one he has ever seen. ""He's good. He can look people in the eye. But we've seen it all before,"" Waters said. ""The main thing he was concerned about was how he thinks others perceive him.""",6090,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/28/1215694489/alex-murdaughs-financial-fraud-victims-confront-him-in-court-before-his-sentenci,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Law and Justice,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,suffer partner generation listen sandra leave conviction shot testify south shame parole detection make await important painkiller year back deal evasion attorney perennial insurance chat orange precise part sentence eye initially include small minute reduce dominate murder burning water clerk million credit presence preside spoke serve jinks promise hour time apology steal ruin tamper home admit duped bench tax neck officer trust prosecutor destroyed paul paid decide involve continue alex family court address disgrace move drunken release simply theft emptiest card enigmatic forget stole hurt hearing lose additional assure catch client testimony allege conjure heard medical resonates crash southern welcome carolina insurer perceive pain oath estate spent soul funeral detailed pay found talk childhood office jury false plea question open anguish scene fall command cry exception speech number incur bring hadwin money satterfield arm judge heavy sincerity dime seek sorry license bar graze jumpsuit concerned grant obtain victim policy marked state bill crime addiction murdaugh overturn model allegation comment tony understand kind person june step life newman longtime denies figure powerful palpable jordan respect loan topic told mark accepted reiterate forgives clifton survive hampton rifle police online young give put financially recount death charge wall child creighton guilty spending friend general dishonor prison prisoner appeal blame injury refer lawyer taylor word visit penny financial investment driver head account betrayed different gloria car podcasts charm member fraud law adamantly seductive drama negotiate defense kill settlement breach tuesday problem county mother maid apologize term ginger avoid treat juror legal laundering local courtroom prays prevent advance trial cheat shotgun group lie wife thousand body september hope federal animal hundred sister dollar maggie,-0.99695,0.3940886699507389,6.654227970897335,0.4664448051948052,0,2023-11-28
