ABC,Wisconsin judge reaffirms July ruling that state law permits consensual abortions,2023-12-05 19:26:00,TODD RICHMOND Associated Press,"MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday reaffirmed her ruling from earlier this year that state law permits consensual medical abortions, opening up appellate options for conservatives.The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the court's landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion, in June 2022 reactivated an 1849 Wisconsin law that conservatives interpreted as banning abortion. Abortion providers ceased operations in the state out of fear of violating the ban.Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit days after the U.S. Supreme Court decision challenging the ban's validity. He argued the statutes were too old to enforce and a 1985 law permitting abortions before fetuses can survive outside the womb trump the ban. Three doctors later joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs, saying they fear being prosecuted for performing abortions.Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled this past July that the ban prohibits someone from attacking a woman in an attempt to kill her unborn child but doesn't apply to consensual medical abortions. Her finding didn't formally end the lawsuit but Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin was confident enough in the ruling to resume abortion procedures at their Madison and Milwaukee clinics in September.Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, asked Schlipper to reconsider her conclusion.Schlipper refused in a 14-page ruling issued Tuesday, writing that Urmanski failed to show how she misapplied state law or made any other mistake and declared that the plaintiffs had won the suit.Urmanski’s attorney, listed in online court records as Andrew Phillips, didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.The lawsuit is likely far from over. the ruling opens the door for conservatives to appeal and a case of this magnitude will likely end up before the state Supreme Court. Liberal justices currently control the court, making it likely that Schlipper's ruling will stand.Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement that it expects to resume abortion procedures at its facility in Sheboygan “as soon as possible.”“Today’s ruling is another important step forward in restoring and expanding access to abortion in Wisconsin,"" the organization said.Kaul called the ruling a “momentous victory.""",2304,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/wisconsin-judge-reaffirms-july-ruling-state-law-permits-105406850,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,sheboygan doctor refuse law declare schlipper online forward ban legalize medical republican trump case violate child appeal attack confident landmark fail respond email appellate parenthood immediately liberal madison reaffirm cease victory magnitude reactivate fear issue find conservative resume operation roe important argue andrew year state josh organization join county wisconsin momentous step challenge facility write circuit restore woman judge expect procedure perform opening unborn statement seek statute overturn interpret provider file reconsider today lawsuit enforce open plaintiff access phillips currently prosecute attorney option july urmanski past clinic list record apply control diane survive prohibits plan validity milwaukee permit general formally consensual supreme mistake day justice expand earlier misapply rule kill ruling call june joel attempt court wade abortion kaul womb make show decision tuesday district fetus,-0.82715,0.390625,13.596363636363634,0.5454166666666668,0,2023-12-05
CNN,"Weight loss drug Zepbound is now available, Eli Lilly says",2023-12-05 19:16:00,Giri Viswanathan,"Drug manufacturer Eli Lilly announced Tuesday that its flagship weight loss medication, Zepbound, is now available for patient use.Tirzepatide, its active ingredient, had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for type 2 diabetes called Mounjaro. Last month, the FDA approved it for use in chronic weight management, placing an official stamp of approval on a medicine widely prescribed off-label for weight loss.Zepbound is intended for adults with obesity, or those who have a BMI higher than 30. It can also be prescribed for people who are overweight — with a BMI of 27 or higher — and who have weight-related medical problems, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea or cardiovascular disease.Tirzepatide works by mimicking two hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, which stimulate the release of insulin in the body. It reduces users’ appetites and slows the rate at which the stomach empties after a meal, helping them feel fuller. Semaglutide medications for weight loss, like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, focus on just targeting GLP-1.The medication will be available in six doses, ranging from 2.5 milligrams to 15 milligrams, through a prescription that can be filled at retail and mail-order pharmacies, Lilly said in a news release.Like other weight loss drugs, Zepbound is an injection patients give themselves once a week. In the news release, Lilly recommends that the drug be used in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.However, Lilly warned that it should not be used alongside other similar weight loss medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy.In clinical trials, Zepbound was found to yield more than 20% average weightloss at higher doses over 72 weeks, more than seen withother approved weight loss medications.According to the FDA, Zepbound’s main side effects include gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea.The drug’s label will also have warnings about the potential for inflammation of the pancreas, gallbladder problems, low blood sugar, acute kidney injury, diabetic retinopathy or damage to the retina in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and suicidal behavior or thinking.Before insurance, Zepbound will cost about $1,060 per month, slightly higherthan Mounjaro’s list price of $1,023.However, it’s still unclear how broadly Zepbound will be covered. Medicare and Medicaid are prohibited from covering obesity medications. Lilly said it is releasing a savings card for people with commercial insurance to get Zepbound for $25 for a one- or three-month prescription if their plans cover it. For those whose plans don’t cover Zepbound, the savings card would lower the cost to $550 per month, or about half the list price.Amid skyrocketing demand for weight loss drugs, many of the therapies have faced supply shortages. Mounjaro is still “in shortage” on the FDA’s drug shortages list, but all dose sizes are labeled as available.",2966,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/health/lilly-zepbound-weight-loss-prescription/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205174100-zepbound-eli-lilly-122023.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,feel side increase suicidal medical empty rate similar body found weightloss weight price dose alongside average appetite unclear withother mimic milligram skyrocket slows administration kidney medicaid sleep size eli damage release treatment mellitus semaglutide gip issue cardiovascular demand loss apnea prohibit insulin type manufacturer yield nausea cover shortage effect pancreas active higherthan available intend high flagship focus patient fda news cost ingredient physical official card commercial approval stimulate gastrointestinal low zepbound obstructive month acute novo sugar pharmacy medication fill announce approve retinopathy lilly problem broadly therapy potential blood reduces include place diet range user food inflammation target gallbladder saving trial stomach hypertension warn chronic supply label give bmi mounjaro meal retail injury slightly list medicine combination warning plan ozempic vomit diabetic prescription recommends clinical prescribed management insurance widely nordisk constipation diabetes wegovy retina call injection overweight hormone medicare half obesity work fuller behavior tuesday week adult stamp,-0.88585,0.0,11.580530303030304,0.4120960884353742,0,2023-12-05
CNN,"US drug shortages are forcing ‘impossible choices’ for Americans, experts tell Senate committee",2023-12-05 18:22:00,Jen Christensen,"As director of the Lymphoma Clinical Research program at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Dr. Jason Westin regularly witnesses the power of lifesaving cancer drugs. But because generic cancer drugs are often in shortage in the United States, he says, he and his patients have been put in a terrible position.“The absence of a generic and cheap drug like fludarabine literally can be the difference between life and death,” Westin told members of the US Senate Committee on Finance at a hearing Tuesday.The committee has been investigating a record shortage of drugs, a problem that’s been going on for decades and is unique to the United States, studies showSeveral senators said they’d heard from constituents who are sick or who have patients hurt by these shortages. Sen. Marsha Blackburn noted that the medical center at Vanderbilt in Nashville has had to dedicate more than 100 staff members to managing and mitigating disruptions caused by shortages.“This is something that is becoming all too common with our providers,” the Tennessee Republican said Tuesday.The majority of the nearly 200 ongoing shortages – 84% – don’t involve new or novel drugs but rather generics that have been on the market for decades, said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. Generics make up 9 of every 10 prescriptions filled in the US, so shortages have a big impact on the country’s health.“These shortages can inflict drastic harm on massive populations of Americans,” Crapo said. “The average shortage affects at least half a million consumers, forcing them to scramble for viable alternatives or they’ll forgo treatment entirely.”Many of these generics treat cancer. Fludarabine, a reliable drug used as a part of CAR T-cell therapy, is in shortage now, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. As with a lot of generic drugs used to treat cancer, it has been on and off the list for a few years.For Westin and his colleagues, patients with rapidly progressing aggressive blood cancers don’t have time to wait for a drug to come back in stock. There’s only a narrow window in which they are well enough to get a potentially lifesaving CAR T-cell therapy, something that works only with fludarabine. There is no alternative, Westin told the committee.“My colleagues have been forced to make impossible choices, including to choose which patients will be prioritized to receive potentially curative therapy,” he said.“We know how to treat cancer, but shortages force impossible choices,” he added. “We have drugs that are lifesaving and shortages that are life-threatening.”A large part of the problem with generics is that they have razor-thin margins and little profit to show for them, so companies often aren’t interested in making them. The number of companies exiting the market to make these drugs exceeds the rate of those entering the market by upwards of 40%, Crapo said.Much of generic manufacturing gets outsourced to other countries like China and India, which can present geopolitical problems as well as quality-control issues, noted Dr. Inmaculada Hernandez, a professor in the Division of Clinical Pharmacy at the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of California in San Diego.“We have a drug supply chain that heavily relies on foreign manufacturing. This is a national public health risk,” Hernandez told the committee.One solution would be for the government to use value-based payments to incentivize large buyers of generics like pharmacies and hospital systems to purchase medicine from manufacturers with more dependable supply chains, she said.Makers of generic drugs don’t have to share information about the supply chain, so buyers currently choose based only on price.To truly end shortages, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the nation’s largest purchaser of drugs, would have to be able to buy based on manufacturing quality and reliability, not just on price, said Dr. Marta E. Wosińska, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.“If we start rewarding reliability, manufacturers can maintain actually a higher price point because it’s rewarded, that reliability. Then there’s going to be an incentive that will follow,” Wosińska testified Tuesday.In other words, more companies would get into the generics business.Another problem the government would have to overcome, experts testified, is the consolidation of generic drug purchasing among a “small group of very powerful health care middle men,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon. Although there is money to be made in generics, it’s going to these middle men – drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs – rather than to manufacturers.“There are many companies that manufacture generics, but they must compete for the attention of highly consolidated middle men,” Wyden said. Three drug wholesalers control 90% of the nation’s pharmaceutical market, he said.“The generic manufacturers that are awarded contracts by these middle men do so by offering penny-on-the-dollar prices,” Wyden said.Offered such low prices, companies don’t earn enough to invest in capacity or in equipment that’s key to making reliable high-quality medicines.“So you have, in effect, a race to the bottom price for generics that leads to quality control problems and factory shutdowns,” Wyden said.These “middle men” have also received criticism for driving up drug prices. In a study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA, Hernandez and her co-authors say that PBMs often pay pharmacies “unjustified excessive amounts for generics, as high as 10 times acquisition costs,” which the PBMs then recover through clawbacks rather than passing on to customers.Hernandez told the Senate committee that of the top 50 generic drugs paid for by Medicare Part D, 16 were marked up 1,000% or higher. For aripiprazole, an antipsychotic drug, pharmacies paid an average of 17 cents per tablet; Rite Aid’s pharmacy benefit manager paid $11.70 per tablet, a 7,000% markup.“So they end up paying much more than, actually, the pharmacy paid for the drug, let alone the manufacturer got for it,” Hernandez said.Hernandez said she recommends greater oversight of PBMs. Legislation currently before the Senate would make it illegal for PBMs to engage in “spread pricing,” in which companies charge payers and health plans more for a prescription drug than what they reimburse the pharmacy, and the PBM pockets the difference.Until there is some kind of legislation that addresses drug shortages, Wosińska and the other experts agreed, they will continue.“What is vexing about these shortages is that they’re largely avoidable,” Wosińska said.",6652,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/health/us-drug-shortages-forcing-impossible-choices/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170512122852-drug-manufacturing.jpg?q=w_1920,h_1080,x_0,y_0,c_fill/w_850",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,vex staff medical national exit ongoing buyer purchaser contract compete jason time oversight charge sick average group terrible fludarabine nation payment medicaid anderson publish scramble impossible award treatment wosińska choice science dependable issue curative reliability india big pay public heavily manufacturer brookings factory shortage affect system committee difference jama china lot high shutdown investigate upwards cost window note recover accord ron outsource crapo absence country force lymphoma majority avoidable common narrow provider largely hernandez blood powerful risk potentially senate forgo progress aid address professor vanderbilt california clawback impact receive tablet marsha hearing record fellow control plan pricing rite aripiprazole number witness clinical company recommends inmaculada small finance base follow viable health hospital blackburn lifesaving benefit houston word study pharmaceutical point inflict generic invest skaggs senior large medicare half buy offering director involve make show enter san share spread capacity wait drive top maintain equipment expert republican pbm rate decade excessive testify price united tennessee administration geopolitical start choose earn exceeds service million hurt dedicate pocket aggressive margin consumer highly key relies research stock westin told state mitigate engage amount mike treat effect massive population cent program marta rapidly constituent prioritize consolidated marked patient race kind paid nashville cancer back low alternative illegal money incentive pharmacy fill chain manager acquisition life passing profit drastic market government center problem information therapy great colleague bottom include attention overcome purchase solution wyden literally currently manage unjustified death disruption american middle purchasing agree food quality economist criticism regularly car incentivize manufacture lead supply unique list member manufacturing interested journal medicine present consolidation part reliable prescription power antipsychotic reimburse wholesaler harm division legislation cheap senator pbms reward showseveral payer school put add heard foreign work tuesday university,-0.0963999999999999,0.1352976548406494,10.668897959183674,0.4413254000901059,0,2023-12-05
ABC,Pregnant Texas woman asks a court to let her have an abortion under exceptions to state's ban,2023-12-05 16:13:00,PAUL J. WEBER Associated Press,"AUSTIN, Texas -- A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis asked a court Tuesday to let her have an abortion, bringing what her attorneys say is the first lawsuit of its kind in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year.Texas is one of 13 states that ban abortion at nearly all stages of pregnancy. Although Texas allows exceptions, doctors and women have argued in court this year that the state's law is so restrictive and vaguely worded that physicians are fearful of providing abortions lest they face potential criminal charges.Kate Cox, 31, is 20 weeks pregnant and has been told by doctors that her baby is likely to be stillborn or live for a week at most, according to the lawsuit filed in Austin. The suit says doctors told her their “hands are tied” under Texas' abortion ban.“Kate Cox needs an abortion, and she needs it now,” the lawsuit reads.Spokespersons for the Texas attorney general's office, which has defended the ban in court, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Molly Duane, Cox's lawyer and an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said Tuesday that a court has not yet scheduled a hearing but one could happen later this week.The lawsuit was filed a week after the Texas Supreme Court heard arguments about whether the ban is too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications. That case is among the biggest ongoing challenges to abortion bans in the U.S., although a ruling from the all-Republican court may not come for months.Cox, a mother of two, had cesarians with her previous pregnancies. She learned she was pregnant for a third time in August and was told weeks later that her baby was at a high risk for a condition known as trisomy 18, which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth and low survival rates, according to the lawsuit.Doctors told Cox that if the baby's heartbeat were to stop, inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture because of her prior cesarians, and that another cesarian at full term would would endanger her ability to carry another child.“It is not a matter of if I will have to say goodbye to my baby, but when. I’m trying to do what is best for my baby and myself, but the state of Texas is making us both suffer,” Cox said in a statement.In July, several Texas women gave emotional testimony about carrying babies they knew would not survive and doctors unable to offer abortions despite their spiraling conditions. A judge later ruled that Texas’ ban was too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications, but that decision was swiftly put on hold after the state appealed.Duane said Cox reached out last week after coming across news stories following the hearing at the state Supreme Court. The arguments were held on the same day that Cox received results of an amniocentesis that confirmed prior tests about her pregnancy.",2884,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/pregnant-texas-woman-asks-court-abortion-exceptions-states-105402038,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/071e9bd6-3f34-4958-bcba-8e0a23963955/wirestory_dc5f97fdccf801f572bb5acffac3ad45_16x9.jpg?w=992,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,doctor law rupture ban ongoing suffer case fearful rate schedule stage time unable swiftly kate physician respond happen immediately test criminal roe big argue pregnant told year state hand likelihood challenge high news emotional baby kind goodbye term accord survival spiral stillbirth low miscarriage woman carry despite judge argument hold office cesarian amniocentesis condition seek knew bring live reproductive center confirm overturn uterine potential file defend mother risk exception full fatal lawsuit vaguely stillborn provide endanger texas attorney lawyer july duane stop receive hearing august induce give suit cox tie learn held survive message follow general supreme matter day word result story prior diagnosis rule reach ruling pregnancy previous complication austin court wade testimony abortion offer put heartbeat trisomy heard ability labor make decision tuesday week restrictive fetus,-0.8853,0.2080443828016643,9.64456721915285,0.3957238095238095,0,2023-12-05
CNN,A new immunization hinted at an end to bad RSV seasons. But an ongoing shortage means babies are still getting sick,2023-12-05 07:16:00,Brenda Goodman,"As a pulmonary critical care specialist, Dr. Cassondra Cramer-Bour knows intimately what RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, can do to a person’s lungs.So she was thrilled in July when the US Food and Drug Administration approved a new antibody designed to prevent severe disease in babies with RSV, and she wanted to get it to protect her then-6-month-old daughter, Kate.She knew that RSV season was coming up and that babies like Kate can get into trouble quickly if the infection fills their tiny airways with fluid, making it difficult to breathe.But Kate’s pediatrician didn’t have any doses of the new immunization, Beyfortus, which was initially recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all babies younger than 8 months who were entering their first RSV season.In October, manufacturer Sanofi said demand had outstripped the supply it had planned for and warned that the 100-milligram doses, the ones given to babies Kate’s age, were scarce. The CDC subsequently recommended that doctors prioritize 100mg doses for babies with underlying medical conditions and those under 6 months of age.Kate was mostly healthy, so Cramer-Bour didn’t search further to find a dose. She now wishes she had.“Knowing how sick she got, I definitely would have taken a vaccine if it was more easily available,” she said.Parents have been eagerly awaiting the new immunization, which clinical trials found to be 75% effective at preventing RSV infections severe enough to be seen by a doctor. Many were willing to shoulder the full $500 cost out-of-pocket to get it, as RSV is the No. 1 cause of hospitalizations in infants in their first year of life.But this therapy that hinted at ending bad RSV seasons as we know them has been sidelined this season by concerns about cost, reimbursement and shortages. Without it, babies are still getting very sick.On Monday, October 30, Kate came home from day care with a cough. A kid coming home from day care with a runny nose, cough or goopy eyes can feel like an almost-everyday event, so the cough didn’t cause immediate alarm for her parents. But by that night, the cough became more frequent, so Cramer-Bour and her husband, James, decided to play it safe and keep Kate home the next day. The plan was for James to watch Kate during the day while Cramer-Bour, who was working nights, slept.When she woke to take over late Tuesday afternoon, Kate was still coughing, but she was playing and drinking and didn’t have a fever, so Cramer-Bour left for work as usual about 5:30 p.m.About 10, her husband started sending her videos of Kate. She didn’t seem like herself, and he was worried. She was breathing a little fast: 40 to 60 times a minute.Cramer-Bour showed the videos to some of her colleagues, who agreed that her daughter looked sick.Her husband brought Kate to Children’s Hospital of Michigan in Detroit to have her evaluated around 11 p.m. Kate was still happy and playing, but her chest was moving a lot with each breath, the small muscles around her ribs drawing in, indicating that she was working very hard to breathe. Her heart rate was high, too.“I think initially the emergency department was thinking, ‘Oh, maybe we can give her a breathing treatment. You know, she’ll kind of turn around and go home,’ ” Cramer-Bour said. But that’s not what happened.“She got worse and worse,” she said.On Wednesday, Kate was admitted to the hospital and given a device called a high-flow nasal cannula to help get more oxygen into her lungs.Cramer-Bour said her daughter seemed to be stuck in a seesaw pattern. She would improve and perk up for a bit, but then something would happen, and she would get worse again. By that night, she had been moved to the pediatric ICU for a higher level of breathing support. They gave her oxygen with some pressure to help get it into her lungs. That helped reduce the work of all the tiny muscles around her ribs that were laboring to help her breathe.“That kind of helped to stabilize her, but she hit a plateau and just didn’t get better,” Cramer-Bour said.Watching her daughter struggle to breathe through those long days and nights was terrifying.“Everything in my training told me that this person needs to be intubated and put on a ventilator, and of course, that’s the rescue therapy,” she said, the last-ditch effort to support a person’s breathing through a crisis.“I was just so scared that was what was going to happen to my baby,” she said.When Beyfortus was approved over the summer, AstraZeneca and Sanofi, the two companies that manufacture the drug, said it would be available for babies in time for RSV season this year.Concerns about insurance reimbursement and cost kept many pediatricians and hospitals from ordering right away. But just as the CDC and payors had worked out a way to resolve some of those issues – offering doctors and hospitals new flexibility to order and pay for the expensive shots – the manufacturers announced that they wouldn’t be able to fill orders.“There’s a great deal of frustration with this situation,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Colorado.“We all saw all these hurdles that we were going need to overcome to get this done this season, and a lot of people spent a lot of time and worked really hard to make it happen, and then the shortage,” said O’Leary, who is also a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.On November 10, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot told Reuters that the company would prioritize the US market for additional doses of Beyfortus this year.On November 16, the CDC and FDA announced that they had expedited the availability of 77,000 additional 100-mg doses of Beyfortus and that these would go to government and private programs.About 3.8 million babies are born in the US each year, and Beyfortus is recommended for all of them, O’Leary said. “So 77,000 doses is a lot of doses, but in the grand scheme of things, it’s not that many relative to how many we need. It does not resolve the shortage.”Last week, White House officials met with AstraZeneca and Sanofi to discuss the manufacturing, distribution, and accessibility of Beyfortus. In a memo about the meeting, the White House said senior administration officials underscored the importance of manufacturers such as Sanofi and AstraZeneca working to meet demand with a sense of urgency heading into the winter season. They also said they worked on starting to plan to meet next year’s projected demand.AstraZeneca declined to answer specific questions about the number of doses of Beyfortus that have been produced or shipped this year.“The demand for Beyfortus has far surpassed any previous standard,” the company said in a statement to CNN on Monday. But it declined to offer any specifics about the standards it was referencing or its planning.“Although we are on track to deliver all doses initially ordered in the US, we are committed to doing more, and we are pleased to confirm that in collaboration with the CDC and government agencies we are accelerating delivery of additional doses this calendar year. We will also continue to work to accelerate supply,” the statement said.O’Leary said pediatricians are hearing it might not be coming in time to make a difference this season. “Basically, what we have been told is that if you haven’t ordered already, you’re not getting anything, and if you have ordered, you might get some of it,” he said.Antibody therapies like Beyfortus, which are grown in living cells in bioreactors, take an extended time to make. It’s not easy for companies to quickly generate more. O’Leary, who is also a vaccine adviser to the CDC, said it was his understanding that Beyfortus production takes nine months.And as RSV season nears its peak, hospitals say they are once again trying to manage an influx of babies who need help to breathe. It wasn’t supposed to be this way.“We’re busy, and it’s frustrating that we’re busy because for the first time in human history, we’ve got a way to prevent RSV, but we’re still struggling to get monoclonal antibodies into the babies that need it,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “The supply is just not there. I think it will be in the future, but this is a tough transition year.”It hasn’t helped that RSV season got off to an early start in some areas, just as it did the year before, said Dr. James Versalovic, who directs diagnostic and laboratory medicine at Texas Children’s Hospital.“We saw a dramatic increase beginning in mid-September, with sustained high activity through the months of October and November,” he said.Versalovic said he doesn’t see Beyfortus or a new maternal immunization from Pfizer, which is given to pregnant women to protect infants in the first few months of life, making a dent in case numbers yet.“This is the case of probably too little, too late,” he said. “We just began receiving antibodies to deliver to patients right at the same time that RSV was cresting in this surge. I don’t think we can say that nationally it’s made any impact in terms of overall numbers of infections.”After three days in intensive care, Kate Cramer-Bour finally started to improve.“Her heart rate started to come down, and she wasn’t having fevers anymore,” her mother said. “So that was really when it felt like ‘OK, we’re probably through the worst of it.’ “She was finally discharged from the hospital five grueling days later, she said.“I would have just given anything to just take it away,” Cramer-Bour said. “I think that’s how most parents would feel.”But they weren’t alone. Friends would drive from 45 minutes away to drop off a casserole or scoop out litter boxes. The family needed all the help they could get.“Hospitalizations are a very big deal for a family,” O’Leary said. “Even a short hospitalization of a day or two is a big deal. But a lot of these hospitalizations are much longer than that.”If a child ends up on a ventilator, they might go on to have longer-term health problems, too.For now, Cramer-Bour says, they are grateful to be home and grateful Kate is back to her happy and healthy self.But they also face a different dilemma: whether to get Beyforus for her this year, if they can find it.Vanderbilt’s Creech says the immunization is still recommended for babies who have recently recovered from RSV, but because those infants are likely to have generated their own strong immunity from their infections, many pediatricians are wondering whether the scarce shots should go instead to babies who haven’t caught the virus.Cramer-Bour says she’ll follow her pediatrician’s recommendation. She’s also trying to share her story on social media to help make other moms aware that there are vaccines this year for mothers and babies that can prevent what happened to them from happening to another family.“That’s been my big focus, is talking with my friends who are pregnant,” she said of Pfizer’s maternal vaccine. “That vaccine is a lot more freely available.”",11066,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/health/beyfortus-rsv-babies/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204220940-baby-stethoscope-stock-120423.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,medical born draw chest anymore fever home effort ship time winter distribution production quickly kate happen minute decline litter scoop intimately effective additional family husband fluid treatment issue activity disease afternoon await discharge creech fast kid big pay laboratory manufacturer spent struggle outstrip shortage lot high daughter hint subsequently easily recover month usual ceo announce statement area knew confirm human suppose order alarm underscored full cannula pascal history texas probably vanderbilt breathe search receive agency casserole hearing demand give pulmonary control frustrate plan instead medium away clinical small peak day intubate goopy busy perk pediatric james department safe nasal collaboration labor make michigan sanofi share feel emergency doctor surpass living infectious case rate icu device dose parent administration meeting calendar grand bioreactors directs million extend late hurdle evaluate woke find year prevention dramatic pediatrician age grueling video focus antibody patient baby availability basically immunization eye seesaw reduce intensive fill trouble shot life recently beyfortus nears center sideline therapy colleague stabilize continue mother overcome expedite virus manage freely bit cough wednesday agree brought july social watch supply diagnostic meet cdc box infant importance level aware story initially november scheme shoulder longer soriot call head short put critical lung muscle work syncytial tuesday week tiny university deal stuck increase reference specific relative child found sick memo cassondra tough runny situation felt airway scar rescue adviser dilemma training question hard difference hospitalization detroit fda white urgency happy cost rib project design term recommend definitely eagerly approve versalovic concern easy drinking immediate breath breathing season send buddy grown commit influx person impact finally warn transition surge turn nose payors number company crest talk cell monoclonal health follow hospital generate spokesperson standard expensive hit previous accelerate future track senior beyforus offer offering pfizer show vaccine oxygen enter resolve drive dent long answer indicate begin thrill wonder mom produce improve night monday worried infection course start plateau discus friend healthy pleased wish difficult private academy event pregnant told specialist cnn pattern available move prioritize sustain severe maternal kind official house grateful back heart flexibility woman underlie support october leary condition decide market government immunity problem prevent early great frustration dr scarce different strong american deliver food accessibility reuters trial manufacture left delivery drop protect admit manufacturing medicine recommendation frequent summer ventilator astrazeneca understand nationally insurance caught rsv respiratory reimbursement young pressure play,0.9956,0.0813302006144948,8.294535519125677,0.4410816364705255,0,2023-12-05
Fox News,"California woman with painful fat deposit disorder gets ‘life-changing’ surgery, has ‘newfound freedom’",2023-12-05 05:00:00,Melissa Rudy,"An estimated one in nine adult women struggle with an abnormal and painful fat buildup in the lower body — and no amount of diet or exercise can help.Lipedema, a relatively common but often overlooked disease, causes fat to accumulate in the lower part of the body, primarily the butt, thighs and calves.For many women, like Molly Friar, an event planner in Sacramento, California, it can cause debilitating pain and impaired mobility.In an effort to raise awareness of this condition, Friar, 53, spoke with Fox News Digital about her long journey to diagnosis — and what she calls her newfound ""freedom.""HIDDEN BELLY FAT COULD SIGNAL ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE RISK 15 YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS SHOW UP, STUDY FINDSFriar was just 11 years old when she started to notice that her body was different than everyone else’s, she said during a phone interview.""The lipedema itself is governed by hormone changes, so that's when things really took off for me,"" she said. ""My legs were different from every other girl in my class, and I started to get a bit of a stomach in my lower abdomen.""Molly Friar, a 53-year-old event planner in Sacramento, California, has suffered from lipedema since she was 11. She is pictured here after her lipedema surgery. (Molly Friar)It was puzzling for Friar, who was very fit and athletic.She played soccer, basketball and softball, and was also a cheerleader — yet no matter how active she was or how carefully she ate, her lower body carried an abnormal amount of fat.""Somehow my legs and stomach were always disproportionately bigger than everybody else's,"" she said.BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR SAYS HER 120-POUND WEIGHT LOSS HELPED SAVE HER LIFE: 'STRONG, CONFIDENT AND HEALTHY'Adding complexity to the situation, Friar is adopted — so she had no context that might have predicted this genetic condition.""I don't have pictures of my family to look at, to see a grandmother or an aunt or other women in my life that were affected by it,"" she said.Friar felt ""completely out of place,"" she said, as everyone else in her family was ""super skinny"" and she was not.Friar was just 12 years old when her parents put her on a Weight Watchers program.""They felt like that was the best thing they could do to help me,"" she said.""I always felt like there was a person inside of me who was thin and just wanted to get out.""Throughout her adolescence and young adulthood, Friar worked out every day, biking to the gym and taking aerobics with all the adults.""That’s absolutely where I started a battle of shame around my body — something I couldn't control,"" she said.Friar is pictured with friends prior to her lipedema surgery. The activities that were pleasant for other people, like getting a massage during a pedicure, created ""excruciating pain,"" she said. (Molly Friar)""I would eat less or not eat, and exercise more, and do all the things I could think of to outpace something that I didn't know existed.""She added, ""I always felt like there was a person inside of me who was thin and just wanted to get out.""In addition to the body image struggles, Friar’s condition also came with extreme pain.EXPERIMENTAL WEIGHT LOSS DRUG COULD HELP TREAT FATTY LIVER DISEASE IN PEOPLE WITH OBESITY, STUDY FINDSLipedema causes inflammation and extreme bruising — ""I would just brush up against something and get a bruise,"" said Friar.The activities that were pleasant for other people, like getting a massage during a pedicure, created ""excruciating pain"" for Friar.For some patients, lipedema can cause difficulty walking. Other common symptoms include swelling, a feeling of heaviness in the legs and excess fatigue. (iStock)For someone with lipedema, she explained, running a hand over the skin is like touching a rocky beach — ""you can feel the nodules like pebbles under the skin.""Other common symptoms include swelling, a feeling of heaviness in the legs and excess fatigue.For some patients, the condition can cause difficulty walking, heightened anxiety and depression, joint issues, venous (vein) disease and other complications, according to Cleveland Clinic.In 2016, when Friar was 45 years old, she lost 50 pounds — but didn’t lose a centimeter in her calves.She started digging in to figure out what was going on. ""I knew something wasn’t right,"" she said.Friar is pictured doing an inversion prior to receiving surgery for her lipedema. Certain poses can help to reduce fluid build-up and swelling. (Molly Friar)In her online research, it wasn’t long before Friar was looking at photos of women with lipedema, with abnormal fat deposits in their lower bodies.""In that moment, I cried — it was like looking in a mirror,"" she told Fox News Digital.""I felt validated and relieved and ecstatic — I finally had an answer.""But the relief was short-lived, as Friar quickly realized there was no cure for her condition. ""It’s something that you have to try to battle for the rest of your life.""""I felt validated and relieved and ecstatic — I finally had an answer.""There are, however, options to alleviate some symptoms that come with lipedema, as Friar found out when she began seeing her doctor, Jaime S. Schwartz, M.D., in Beverly Hills, California.A board-certified plastic surgeon and world-renowned lipedema specialist, Schwartz has dedicated much of his career to raising awareness for fat disorders like lipedema.He launched Total Lipedema Care to help women like Friar.Dr. Jaime Schwartz, a board-certified plastic surgeon and world-renowned lipedema specialist, has dedicated much of his career to raising awareness for fat disorders like lipedema. (Total Lipedema Care)""Most people will tell you that the lower half of their body just started growing a lot larger than the upper half, usually during puberty,"" Schwartz told Fox News Digital.""It doesn't start as pain, but they start seeing physical changes that don’t really make sense.""Lipedema is usually misdiagnosed as morbid obesity, Schwartz noted.Surgery is the best option to relieve lipedema symptoms.""In the U.S., many doctors tell women, ‘You're fat, you did this to yourself,’"" he said.MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD'S POPULATION WILL BE OBESE OR OVERWEIGHT BY 2035, SAYS NEW REPORTBut the good news, he said, is that awareness is slowly starting to grow.""Over the past five years, it's gone from no one knowing about it to a lot of people knowing about it, so it's definitely getting better.""As Schwartz told Friar, he recommends surgery as the best option to relieve lipedema symptoms.At his practice, Schwartz performs a patented procedure called manual lipedema extraction, which involves a combination of liposuction and the removal of underlying nodules of fat through small incisions.Friar said her life is like ""night and day"" compared to before her surgeries. ""I feel it changed the game for me — it extended my life and I gained back probably 75% to 80% of my mobility."" (Molly Friar)""When I take the ‘bad tissue’ out, people feel better as soon as the next day,"" Schwartz said. ""That's the only thing that I've seen that works — and I've seen everything that's out there.""Friar ended up having a total of three surgeries — one on the back of her legs, one in the stomach area and one on the front of her legs.""For me, the surgery was life-changing,"" Friar said. ""I feel it changed the game for me — it extended my life and I gained back probably 75% to 80% of my mobility.""""I'm willing to shout from the rooftops if I can help even one person recognize the symptoms and be able to help themselves.""Each surgery required around six weeks of recovery time.""It isn’t easy, but I would do it 1,000 times over,"" she said.One caveat is that some insurance companies have been slow to cover the cost of lipedema surgeries. Friar had to pay out of pocket for the procedures, which can range from $4,000 to $16,000, according to Schwartz's website.""I was very, very lucky — there are so many women who want the surgery that can't afford it,"" she said.Friar is pictured after her lipedema surgeries. ""It’s like your mobility gets taken away from you, and when you instantly get it back, it's like newfound freedom,"" she told Fox News Digital. (Molly Friar)In addition to the surgeries, dietary changes have had a big impact on Friar’s quality of life.""The optimal diet for me is gluten-free and dairy-free, with no added sugars, no processed foods, low salt and very little alcohol,"" she said.She also wears medical-grade compression gear at night and lighter-compression leggings during the day.""It helps alleviate a lot of the inflammation and excess fluid in the body,"" she said.Other non-surgical options for relief include exercise and medications or supplements to reduce inflammation.10 FUNCTIONAL HEALTH PREDICTIONS FOR 2024, ACCORDING TO A DOCTOR AND A WELLNESS EXPERTAs Schwartz told Fox News Digital, Friar’s case was pretty typical of most women’s experiences with lipedema, although he noted her positive mindset.""A lot of women have had this for so long, and it defeats them emotionally, psychologically and mentally,"" he said. ""But Molly has always had such an amazing outlook and personality.""He added, ""Obviously, it's been emotional for her at times, but she never let it defeat her.""Friar said her life now is ""like night and day"" compared to before.""Getting a massage for me is now enjoyable,"" she said through tears. ""I can climb to the top of a mountain, and I can walk six miles and not stop.""Friar wears medical-grade compression gear at night and lighter-compression leggings during the day.

Politico,AI is driving Google’s health care business. Washington doesn’t know what to do about it.,2023-12-04 16:39:00,Ruth Reader,"Google wants to make your cell phone a “doctor in your pocket” that relies on the company’s artificial intelligence.But first, the tech giant will need to convince skeptical lawmakers and the Biden administration that its health AI isn’t a risk to patient privacy and safety — or a threat to its smaller competitors.Google has assembled a potent lobbying team to influence the rules governing AI just as regulators start writing them. But members of Congress say they’re concerned that the company is using its advanced AI in health care before government has had a chance to draw up guardrails. Competitors worry Google is moving to corner the market. Both fear what could happen to patient privacy given Google’s history of vacuuming personal data.“There is great promise in many of these tools to save more lives,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), adding that “they also have the potential to do exactly the opposite — harm patients and their data, reinforce human bias, and add burdens to providers as they navigate a clinical and legal landscape without clear norms.”Google’s AI scours medical records, research papers, imaging, and clinical guidelines to help doctors diagnose diseases and evaluate treatment options. The tech giant’s already selling these tools to hospitals. It’s inked a deal with the Mayo Clinic, for one — and it foresees much more, including direct-to-consumer applications.Warner recently sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, saying he was troubled that hospitals are using the company’s AI without sufficient vetting.Mark Isakowitz, Google’s North American head of policy and government affairs and formerly Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman’s chief of staff, responded that the company’s technology isn’t trained on personal health information and that it’s only deployed at a limited capacity. Isakowitz said that health systems have control over how it’s used and monitor its behavior.President Joe Biden has tasked his agencies with figuring out how to ensure AI in health care serves patients as well as flesh-and-blood physicians do, if not better, but rules could be months or years away. Though the Food and Drug Administration approves medical devices that use AI, it has no rules governing advanced software-based tools.Google isn’t waiting for the agency to write them. It’s now piloting its AI with Mayo Clinic researchers, as an assistant. HCA Healthcare, which operates more than 2,000 hospitals and other health care facilities across the U.S. and U.K., is using it to write clinical notes for its physicians and nurses.Bayer Pharmaceuticals is also trying it out within clinical trials, helping to craft communications. And electronic medical record company Meditech is using the technology to summarize patient history.As lawmakers like Warner and regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration ponder what to do, Google’s hiring former government health care regulators well positioned to advocate for the company.The “doctor in your pocket” quote is from Karen DeSalvo, who oversaw health information technology regulation for President Barack Obama and who is now Google’s chief health officer.Startups are concerned Google and other tech giants will push for regulations that squeeze smaller rivals.The smaller firms want to head off reporting requirements Biden directed his agencies to create in an executive order on AI regulation in October. They think such requirements would be easy for titans like Google or Microsoft but difficult for less well-financed rivals.“They’re going to basically create a setup where we will be dependent just on them to move forward,” said Punit Soni, CEO of clinical note-taking company Suki AI, referring to big tech players in health care including Google.Google learned an important lesson about working with Washington in 2019.That’s when its first effort to apply its prowess with “Big Data” to patient records — a deal with the St. Louis-based hospital chain Ascension to analyze tens of millions of health records — sparked a Department of Health and Human Services inquiry over privacy concerns.This time, Google appears to be getting ahead of problems with regulators before they arise.Google’s parent company has hired several former Food and Drug Administration officials, including Bakul Patel, the agency’s former chief digital health officer, who directed the FDA’s early thinking on AI. The agency, headed by a former Google parent company employee, Robert Califf, figures to lead the Biden administration’s rulemaking.Google is also a member of the Coalition for Health AI, a group of health systems and technology companies working to shape AI standards in coordination with federal health agencies. The group published its inaugural “blueprint” for AI in health care this year. It also helped inform the National Academy of Medicine’s Health Care AI Code of Conduct.In the wake of President Biden’s executive order on artificial intelligence, policymakers are trying to get up to speed on the technology — Biden has asked for reports and recommendations and set deadlines — and Google wants to help.In mid-November, the company published a policy agenda for AI, calling for pro-innovation laws as well as infrastructure to support the advancement and adoption of AI.The company sees itself as a partner to the government. Now senior director of global digital health strategy and regulatory at Google, Patel said that the company spends a lot of time explaining how the technology works to officials so they can set standards.“We can’t tell them what to do, but we can educate them,” he said.The artificial intelligence Google is selling sits in a regulatory gray zone.The FDA authorizes AI-enabled medical devices, but its reviews were designed for less advanced technology.No one from the government is ensuring newer, software-based tools do what they promise.Last year, the agency said it would seek to review some of those products, but it hasn’t yet done so. In the meantime, the agency has published an action plan for regulating AI and guidance around what algorithms fall within its scope and what information companies should include in applications for marketing clearance.The Biden administration shared, via its executive order, stipulations for how agencies should monitor and collect data from advanced AI models that may have national security or public health impacts. Still, the executive order is largely a request for agencies to conduct studies to better understand how the technology should be safeguarded.That is a preliminary step to eventually writing regulations that could be months or years away.Meanwhile, Congress is slowly getting up to speed. Both the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee have held hearings exploring AI and how it might be regulated within health care.Members asked questions concerning AI’s impact on everything from personal data collection to its use in the development of bioweapons. But so far, no legislation is forthcoming.Senators led by John Thune (R-S.D.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have proposed the Artificial Intelligence Research, Innovation, and Accountability Act of 2023, but it is not specific to health care and has not advanced since its introduction last month.Meanwhile, FDA expects big growth in AI-enabled medical devices this year, up over 30 percent from 2022.Google is steadily launching artificial intelligence projects and products. The company is now licensing algorithms for detecting breast cancer, lung cancer and gene mutations. It also continues to test AI as a tool for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, as well as for spotting anomalies in ultrasound images.The rollout of Google’s Med PaLM-2, a bot that can answer questions and pass medical licensing exams, builds on existing relationships with health care companies. Bayer partners with Google Cloud on AI for clinical trials and to jump start early drug discovery. Before Google began piloting Med-PaLM 2 at the Mayo Clinic, the two had collaborated on AI that helps plan radiological treatment for head and neck cancers. HCA Health has used Google Cloud since 2021.Google’s vision for health care isn’t limited to health care companies. It has ambitions to play a role in consumer health. It already has FitBit, a wearable that collects vital signs and other fitness metrics. And it has tested other consumer tools like DermAssist, which aims to diagnose skin conditions and is marked as a low risk medical device in Europe.DeSalvo sees smartphones as a key tool in the future of medicine.“So much will happen just from a device that’s honestly pretty inexpensive and in the hands of a huge chunk of the planet,” said DeSalvo. “I’m pretty keen to think about that as a platform for people, for consumers.”The main concern from regulators, legal experts and startups is that AI will infiltrate health care before legislators can wrap their heads around it.Mason Marks, senior fellow at Harvard Law’s Petrie-Flom Center, said it’s not just that there are no laws regulating the new AI. Old laws designed to protect patients don’t really hold up under the weight of this next generation technology, he said.Marks is worried that HIPAA, a decades-old law designed to protect patient privacy, falls apart in the face of large language models because HIPAA allows health systems and their vendors to use de-identified patient data.“Once you remove certain personal identifiers, you can do whatever you want with it,” he said. Researchers point out that de-identified data can be re-identified if juxtaposed with additional data using AI.Even if it isn’t, there are ethical considerations, Marks said. He points to an incident with Crisis Text Line, a text-based teen mental health hotline that was selling de-identified data for marketing purposes without user consent. It’s not illegal, but he questions whether it’s ethical, especially when companies use that data to improve AI systems from which they profit.Getting access to that data may also have antitrust implications, he said. “Companies like Google who invest heavily in AI systems for hospitals and health care systems can gain an enormous competitive advantage or monopoly position with all the data that they’re generating,” said Marks.Soni at Suki AI is also concerned about issues of competition and privacy, but from another perspective.He’s worried regulators are focusing on drafting rules that would create compliance burdens that don’t necessarily ensure protection for privacy or from bias, but that make it difficult for small innovators to compete with deep-pocketed firms like Google.“I feel like we have doubled down on reporting, and not actually explained compliance,” he said. “I would rather we actually spend some time trying to figure out what is the AI version of HIPAA.”",10865,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/04/google-washington-ai-health-00129962,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/b2d6a09/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2002+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F87%2Faf%2F8c754ac24c928ae224565e287578%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F486234008,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,share convince formerly model discovery chain food tech wrap company large sundar law deal hospital rule facility marked make energy clinic advocate legislation seek foresees bias competitor administration medicine pocket regulator save implication image worry global refer inked limited technology electronic vendor data official digital approves service user especially tool advanced medical difficult paper protect wake dependent set infiltrate agenda soni effort executive assistant john play squeeze monopoly regulatory regulate group hire skin consideration deployed necessarily work purpose guideline policy intelligence hold obama partner heavily key govern move potential diabetic guidance robert act newer information direct weight answer ultrasound write stipulation platform important joe figure launch introduction isakowitz pichai titan smartphones october sell clear call biden patel thune cancer version former preliminary condition senior give monitor explain competition influence create ceo spark future option inexpensive concern collaborate requirement doctor explore market head center scour eventually competitive serf mark issue jump guardrail policymakers hotline rob ten inform navigate inquiry improve add held largely big gop collection relies planet pilot month question request dermassist assemble communication troubled strategy ensure parent fear chief bioweapon sufficient potent affair landscape house line bakul year pension expert legislator oversaw director letter order committee concerned risk product worried government life deadline lead patient note klobuchar project fellow compliance test aim propose skeptical rollout juxtapose punit fall recommendation advancement innovation incident report draw huge advantage firm mutation code team mental learn metric microsoft expect regulation warner continue fitness control protection cell meditech build operates identifier american sign chance diagnose role tasked disease agency respond infrastructure washington suki bot draft security artificial inaugural language million spot specific point accountability device support chunk push reinforce neck lawmaker system prowess vision coordination member national scope relationship educate wait vital giant health employee hand coalition gene consent recently bayer collect physician early algorithm radiological mayo position anomaly illegal wearable gray low ponder education steadily crisis phone safety ohio fitbit start capacity craft happen treatment fda google startup setup provider evaluate ascension plan authorizes focus desalvo slowly innovator study time history quote action public blueprint invest basically hipaa privacy impact easy access officer vacuum train problem generate ahead department north lung antitrust detect legal exist president step retinopathy record consumer adoption double generation hca personal additional small pretty standard trial player growth ethical lesson staff conduct labor academy federal research human honestly healthcare meantime hearing away percent harvard remove understand begin burden corner portman apply compete publish congress marketing califf cloud lobbying promise harm spend pharmaceutical researcher design include feel shape commerce text enormous development forward spends summarize great keen sits clinical lot licensing application amy threat speed breast analyze opposite senate barack ambition exam review reporting,0.99115,0.082834790612057,11.32513610683102,0.4020780464745984,0,2023-12-04

Fox News,'Tomboy' who regretted gender transition breaks down crying describing difficulty of breast removal surgery,2023-12-04 05:00:00,Hannah Grossman,"A 24-year-old girl, who was a ""tomboy"" as a child until transitioning into a trans-male, says she is reclaiming her femininity after undergoing medical and surgical sex change interventions – including taking testosterone and removing her breasts – in Stockholm, Sweden.Nikita Teran is a TikTok influencer, who currently identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community. She has taken to the platform to share her story about finding her true gender after previously identifying as transgender. She told Fox News Digital in an interview that she wishes her treating doctors would have asked more questions to uncover the comorbid psychological issues Teran experienced at the time.At two points during the interview, Teran broke down. The first time, she discussed a point in her teenage years when her father left the family. She was devastated, and around that same time she began to experience gender dysphoric symptoms. During the second time, Teran described the challenging experience with complications from her breast removal surgery – a double mastectomy.""Prior to that, I was struggling with the things that were happening at my home. I would probably call it something like depression,"" Teran said. She added that she was treated at a psychiatric clinic for issues.DETRANSITIONED BOY CASTRATED BY DOCTORS WARNS KIDS ABOUT PERILS OF GENDER IDEOLOGY: 'PATIENT FOR LIFE'Nikita Teran is a detrans influencer on TikTok. (Nikita Teran | Instagram )""Before getting in touch with the gender clinic, I was at another unit for children with mental health issues. So I was there first and I thought I would get some type of help. I wasn't there for gender dysphoria, I was at that unit for mental health issues. They sort of didn't know what to do with me,"" she said.""When I came to the trans unit. I was very open with my father and my family and I think I was crying every meeting I had with them when talking about my father. But still, they didn't see any red flags for that,"" she said. ""I wish they would have stopped me. I wish they would have seen the red flags and realized that this might be gender dysphoria caused by trauma or things like that.""BIDEN PARTNERED WITH ORGANIZATION WHICH QUESTIONED PARENTS' RIGHTS TO BE NOTIFIED ABOUT THEIR KIDS' TRANSITIONGender dysphoria, formerly called Gender Identity Disorder, describes a condition in which a person has a persistent unease with one's biological sex, causing psychological disturbances and/or distress.Teran began to experience dysphoria in her mid-teens, went to the clinic at 17, began testosterone at 18 and had her double mastectomy at 19.Nikita Teran discusses her transition and the complications from the breast removal surgery. (Nikita Teran )""I was really scared. I was really nervous. I never had surgery before [but]… I just wanted to get this done and live my life,"" she said.Teran said she had to get rushed in for emergency surgery mere hours after the initial surgery.""After my initial surgery, I was feeling very sick, and they noticed that there was something wrong with me,"" she said. ""I don't remember what the condition was. I think it was like bleeding inside. [My chest] was very, very large with blood. So that same night I had to be rushed into the emergency room for another surgery.""""Having to go through that second surgery was just very scary,"" she said.Then, the recovery aspect was also tough. ""I wasn't allowed to work. I was mostly laying at home.""MEDICAL SCHOOL PROFESSOR SAYS PARENTS MUST IMPLEMENT GENDER IDEOLOGY FOR BABIES: 'IT... STARTS AT BIRTH'After recovering from surgery, Teran described a time when she felt like ""one of the boys,"" when she was living her ""tomboy dreams."" But then, around the age 20, she started to explore her sexuality, and that raised questions about what she thought was her gender identity.""But as time went by and as more, I explored myself and my body with other people, I started feeling weird about it. It started feeling like why am I okay with this? And questions like that started running through my mind.""Detransitioner breaks down while discussing complications from breast removal surgery. (Fox News Digital )Teran also developed side effects from testosterone – vaginal atrophy – and was recommended by her doctor to stop it.According to Drexel University College of Medicine, ""Transmasculine people on testosterone may experience atrophic vaginitis. It is thought to be due to the suppressive effects of testosterone on estrogen, leading to an estrogen-deprived state that appears to be similar to the experience of many post-menopausal cis women.""""It was very surprising to me because once you start taking testosterone, they kind of go through with you what to expect. And I knew about the main things like voice and body hair, facial hair. And the hairline receding. I had no idea what [atrophic vaginitis] was. I was running around to different doctors who didn't know anything about trans patients. And it was a very, very just a very confusing and scary time for me because I didn't know what was happening with my body.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTeran, now detransitioned, said that she has now dropped out of her master's program until she figures out next steps for her future.",5233,https://www.foxnews.com/media/detransitioner-breaks-down-describing-difficulty-breast-removal-surgery-something-wrong-me,https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/b1413849-9485-44d7-9c85-1282dbe9d9bc/763558b3-88ac-4d20-bb57-c3bab3bdf862/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cgyUI9sP8zj7Zhf5tpOI2wHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,share living felt formerly transitiongender developed implement transgender type emergency surprising large appteran dysphoria organization surgery mental discus notice probably depression clinic cry influencer suppressive expect talk atrophy blood woman medicine intervention touch live break college age comorbid room experience digital realize dream tough treat point weird recommend detrans run medical inside hair described click knew scar boy prior school health ideology baby stop drexel struggle estrogen left due red stockholm part work broke fox father girl testosterone partner experienced surgical bleeding currently state previously aspect transmasculine told mind tomboy news kind undergo platform femininity unease meeting removal start remember community figure kid persistent happen describes person vaginitis disturbance transition lay chest call biden devastate initial night story tiktok condition time different psychological drop recede sexuality vaginal nikita notify future similar interview side doctor explore find home voice teran nervous symptom step change hour issue master double recover scary identity add open wrong warns hairline question biological uncover parent atrophic effect facial flag discuss challenge gender psychiatric remove wish recovery year begin reclaim disorder identifies sick detransitioned child raise dysphoric family trauma university sex identify mastectomy body include feel program life idea lead teenage patient sort confuse castrate rush complication unit breast professor peril instagram detransitioner trans,-0.98065,0.0573284922606535,8.300314341846757,0.3487083973374295,0,2023-12-04
CNN,Buried by your to-do list? Here are 5 tips to help you dig out,2023-12-03 12:00:00,Andrea Kane,"Season 8 of the podcast Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta gets back to basics with an in-depth examination of the brain in different states. Each episode will focus on one of those states — the distracted brain, the frightened brain, etc. — to spotlight what is going on in our heads and how it affects our bodies.(CNN) — Do you walk around with a to-do list in your pocket or in your head? If so, you are not alone.It’s a fact of life that most people have an ongoing list of tasks that must get done on a regular basis. Things such as feeding/bathing/transporting yourself (or the kids), washing the dishes, swinging by the grocery store, doing laundry, taking out the garbage, mowing the lawn, paying bills, tidying the house. You get the idea.But sometimes managing even the simplest task can seem insurmountably hard.Houston author and licensed therapist KC Davis learned this firsthand at the start of the pandemic. At the time, she thought she had an airtight plan that would allow her to work after her second child was born.“Unfortunately, three weeks after I gave birth, I got a phone call from the day care saying, ‘Hey, lockdown has started. …’” And just like that, her plan evaporated.And all those “care tasks,” as she calls them, started to pile up as depression.“As I struggled really hard to take care of both babies’ needs at once,” Davis told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life. “All of a sudden, the dishes start piling up, the laundry starts piling up. You know, I’ve always been a messy person, but it’s always been functional. And for the first time in my life, it really wasn’t functional.”Davis did what many did when the pandemic began: She turned to TikTok, posting about her struggles, along with her evolving approach to solutions. She attracted many followers and eventually even published a book called “How to Keep House While Drowning: A Gentle Approach to Cleaning and Organizing.”Davis said those care tasks are seemingly simple, but in reality they’re complex, involving many steps that require executive functioning skills.“Executive functioning skills happen in your prefrontal cortex,” Davis said. “It’s the part of your brain that does time management, that does task initiation, that looks at something and breaks it down into steps. And if those things are all firing on all cylinders for you, it feels automatic. You just decide to do the dishes and you do them.”But sometimes it’s not automatic.“There are some people that have disorders that disrupt those executive functions,” she said. “If you are depressed, anxious, if you’ve got ADHD … but even if you don’t have a diagnosis, there are lots of things that can compromise your executive functioning: sleep deprivation, chronic stress, being burnt out.”Life circumstances, such as having a sick parent or experiencing a busy period at work, can also erode a person’s executive functioning ability.When one or more stumbling blocks derail you, you can feel overwhelmed and even paralyzed — unable to complete your care tasks, which then start to pile up and overwhelm you even more. The longer it goes on, the worse you feel about yourself and the more frozen you can become.It’s important to understand that the inability to perform care tasks is not a moral failure, Davis said.“I want people to know that care tasks — whether it’s cooking, cleaning, dishes, feeding yourself, getting into the shower — they are morally neutral. Meaning, if you find them hard to do, that’s not a reflection on whether you are good, bad, right, wrong, a success or failure,” she said.“It’s almost never this issue of not trying hard enough. It’s always an issue of a legitimate barrier, a struggle to get the right coping skill, a struggle to get the right guidance, and really the struggle to stop hating ourselves long enough to figure out a way through.”Plus, experiencing self-hate, guilt, anxiety and shame, Davis said, make it even harder to break out of the cycle, in part because these emotions hijack precious brain resources: Instead of focusing on the task at hand, you may dwell on the futile activity of self-flagellation.“No one has ever berated themselves into better mental health, and you deserve practical solutions that work with the level of ability you have today,” she said.So, what are some of those solutions? Davis has these five tips:Find a solution that makes sense for you. For example, going all-out Marie Kondo overnight might not be feasible — it wasn’t for Davis.“What I had to realize was, I’m a messy person, I have ADHD, I have two kids, I have a dog, a cat, right? Like I have all these things,” she said. “I can’t pick solutions for my life that depend on me waking up a completely different person tomorrow, with a completely different personality and skill set and life and energy and time needs. I need to be able to learn how to organize as a messy person. I need to be able to clean as a messy person. I need skills that work with my brain, instead of against my brain.”That’s right: Stock up on laundry baskets, and while you’re at it, waste baskets.“(This) tip is my most simple one, which is to get a laundry basket and a full-sized trash can in every room of your house,” Davis said. “Because so much of our mess is needing to throw something away or taking off a jacket or something. … So if you put (baskets) in every room, you’re never more than a couple of steps away from being able to put those where they go.”Stick to the bare minimum and don’t make things overly complicated.“(Another) tip is to cut out any steps that don’t matter to you when it comes to any of your care rituals,” Davis said. “For example, if you don’t want to fold all of your clothes, you don’t have to. Maybe there’s a few shirts you don’t want to be wrinkled. Great: Hang those up. The rest of them mostly do just fine … tossed into organized baskets. Same with your dishes. I find that if you want to skip the rinsing, if you want to skip the scrubbing, just run the dishwasher twice. It’s really fine.”A big challenge for many is finding a home for everything and then putting everything in its place. For that, Davis has an elegant solution.“If you’re like me, once everything gets into a junk drawer, it becomes this doom pile of things, and you don’t really know what’s in there,” Davis said. “And I find that if you get a clear shoe holder and you put it on the back of a closet door, for example, and instead, you use that for your little odds and ends — so this is where that glue stick goes or those random hair ties … — all the little random things that would be coming together in a junk drawer soup are now hung in a way that you can actually see everything that you have and get to things easily.”Observe your living space and your family’s behavior — and do what comes naturally.“I’m a big fan of baskets, and I don’t think that you have to bother with a lot of fancy supplies. Truly just look where your things are — where they’re naturally happening — and then put a basket there,” Davis said. “If you’re always taking your shoes off by the front door, instead of (thinking) ‘Oh, I’m going to completely change my behavior around this thing and instead go to the closet,’ maybe just put a basket by the front door and boom: organized! As long as your things are where you intended them to be, you’re organized.”We hope these five tips help you feel more organized and less stuck. Listen to the full episode here.

Washington Post,The strange tale of Scotland’s buried Egyptian treasures,2023-12-02 06:00:00,not specified,"When a Scottish schoolboy’s spade hit on a reddish object on the grounds of his boarding school in 1952, he thought he’d found a potato. He was mistaken: It was a red sandstone sculpture from ancient Egypt.It was also the beginning of a bizarre series of ancient archaeological finds, resulting in a trove of Egyptian artifacts that eventually made its way to the National Museum of Scotland.And now, researchers are finally revealing how the artifacts got to Scotland in the first place.The strange story took decades to unfold. Between the 1950s and 1980s, students at a boarding school housed in a historic mansion in Fife, Scotland, kept stumbling across ancient objects, including the 4,000-year-old sandstone sculpture, a bronze figurine of a man and other rare artworks thought to date from Egypt’s 12th Dynasty. Research didn’t prove their origins, so they were deemed a national treasure trove and given to Scotland’s national museum.Now, Scottish curators think they’ve cracked the case. The house where the treasures were found was built in the 18th century and was eventually inherited by Alexander Leslie-Melville, Lord Balgonie, who in the 1850s served as an officer in the Crimean War. A portrait from the time is thought by some to be the first photo portraying shell shock, a historic term for what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder.The war shattered the officer’s health, and in 1856 he traveled to Egypt in the hopes its climate would help him heal.“During this period in Egypt, consuls and dealers would visit hotels or passing boats to sell antiquities, so it is possible the objects were brought to a bedridden Balgonie or that his sisters assembled the collection,” according to National Museums Scotland.Balgonie was only 25 when he died in 1857. Researchers now believe that the artifacts may have been associated with his painful loss, put in an outbuilding, and forgotten or abandoned.Either way, they say, they are spectacular evidence of the gigantic scale of a 19th-century antiquities collection. As the United Kingdom expanded its empire throughout the era, many of its citizens traveled abroad and plundered ancient troves, acquiring thousands of precious objects via looting, bartering and gifts. Many remain in the U.K. to this day.“It was an exciting challenge to research and identify such a diverse range of [artifacts], including some remarkable objects,” Margaret Maitland, principal curator of the ancient Mediterranean at National Museums Scotland, said in a news release. “The bronze priest statuette is a relatively rare form, while the sandstone statue head is a masterpiece of Egyptian sculpture.”",2656,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2023/12/02/egyptian-treasure-buried-fife-scotland/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUTQHIXOLFFJ7F7TMDDOTMH4ZA.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUTQHIXOLFFJ7F7TMDDOTMH4ZA.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUTQHIXOLFFJ7F7TMDDOTMH4ZA.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUTQHIXOLFFJ7F7TMDDOTMH4ZA.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUTQHIXOLFFJ7F7TMDDOTMH4ZA.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUTQHIXOLFFJ7F7TMDDOTMH4ZA.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,remain ground make abroad sister passing finally bronze begin spade deem mediterranean challenge associate find strange historic photo kingdom include citizen term research red stumble sandstone dealer assemble period schoolboy gift sculpture found boat diverse news precious time travel range portray outbuilding figurine egypt statuette decade crack series story loot bedridden shell climate sell century antiquity acquire prove reveal treasure head health museum thousand put accord excite visit spectacular dynasty mansion margaret maitland principal crimean scale gigantic brought archaeological masterpiece serve egyptian possible curator give unfold trove date identify potato national statue release case artwork hope evidence reddish scottish artifact fife ancient consul plunder inherit remarkable student lord bartering bizarre scotland built empire researcher school relatively origin collection believe rare balgonie hit expand mistaken shatter object house form boarding loss portrait painful eventually priest forgotten shock officer result united stress alexander,0.1845,0.2259036144578313,10.631687242798352,0.565530303030303,0,2023-12-02
New York Times,What to Know About Home Care Services,2023-12-02 05:02:00,Reed Abelson,"By Reed AbelsonMost older Americans want to live at home as long as they can, but finding and affording the help they need often isn’t easy. There are severe shortages of home health aides in many parts of the country. Hiring them is costly. And most middle-class people will have to pay for home care themselves if they will need it for the long haul. Here’s a guide to locating home care for an older person.After a fall or surgery, some older people will need short-term care at home from a nurse or therapist to help them recover. Medicare, the federal insurance program for those 65 and over, typically pays for this kind of home health care. A nurse can make sure a wound is healing properly, for example, while a physical therapist can help a person get back on their feet after a knee replacement.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Reed Abelson covers the business of health care, focusing on health insurance and how financial incentives affect the delivery of medical care.

Washington Post,"Childhood pneumonia outbreak in Ohio unrelated to China, Europe",2023-12-01 18:14:00,"Fenit Nirappil, Lena H. Sun","Health authorities are monitoring an outbreak of pneumonia in children in an Ohio county, stressing it appears driven by familiar pathogens with no connection to pneumonia clusters in China and parts of Europe.Officials in Warren County, which is in the Cincinnati area, reported 145 cases of pneumonia in children ages 3 to 14 since August. The caseload is higher than normal and reaches the state’s threshold for an outbreak, but there have been no deaths or evidence of increased severity, officials said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been in touch with Ohio officials and is also monitoring the increases in respiratory illness among children, including potential elevated rates of pediatric pneumonia, in parts of the United States. Officials said the reported trends do not appear to be due to a new virus or other novel pathogen, but instead attribute the increases to several viral or bacterial causes expected during the respiratory illness season.“As of today, we are not seeing anything that is atypical in terms of pneumonia-related emergency department visits,” CDC Director Mandy Cohen told reporters Friday, noting that “a lot of kids” are going to the emergency department for respiratory illness such as flu and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which can be dangerous for some infants and young children.The CDC monitors overall respiratory illnesses using data reported daily from about 80 percent of the country’s emergency departments. Nationwide data as of Nov. 25 show that diagnosed pneumonia rates in children are not unusual for this time of year, CDC officials said.The Ohio cases have not caused undue strain on the state’s health-care system and the overall respiratory virus trends are typical for this time of year, Cohen said. “Hospital capacity is fine. Children are recovering at home,” she said. “There’s no evidence that any of those increases are connected to other outbreaks nationally or internationally.”Respiratory illness is spreading in most of the country, and CDC officials said they expect levels of covid-19, influenza and RSV to continue to increase. “RSV season is in full swing,” Cohen said, and flu spread is “accelerating fast.” Covid-19 remains the primary cause of new respiratory hospitalizations and deaths, with about 15,000 hospitalizations and about 1,000 deaths every week, according to the CDC.The outbreak in Warren County attracted outsize attention that erroneously linked it to clusters of childhood pneumonia in northern China. The CDC and independent public health experts who monitor China say the cases appear driven by the usual mix of respiratory viruses including influenza, coronavirus and RSV, as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a type of bacteria that can infect the lungs. All of these pathogens circulate in the United States.Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause several types of infection, including chest colds and pneumonia. While some media outlets have used the term “white lung syndrome” to describe illness caused by mycoplasma, public health authorities do not use the term and some experts caution it creates a misleading perception of a dangerous unknown disease.In fact, the bacteria is fairly common, and when it causes pneumonia, it’s not as severe as other types of bacterial pneumonias, which is why it is often referred to as “walking pneumonia,” said Paul Offit, a professor of pediatrics at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Offit said he has never heard the term “white lung” in reference to this disease. Although physicians treat the disease with antibiotics, such as azithromycin, it often resolves on its own.Since the pandemic, he said, parents and physicians may be paying more attention to symptoms of respiratory illness — cough, runny nose, fever, difficulty breathing — because people want to know whether it’s covid-19. “That’s caused people to pay more attention to respiratory infections, and more importantly, pay more attention to making the diagnosis,” Offit said.Warren County officials said it’s unclear why they are experiencing a rise in pneumonia, which usually isn’t reported to health authorities.“We have no evidence whatsoever of any connection to any outbreaks statewide or internationally,” said Clint Koenig, a family physician and medical director at the Warren County Health Department. “We don’t have any evidence to suggest this is anything but routine, standard winter bugs causing pneumonia in higher rates in kids.”A mix of pathogens are behind the pneumonia cases, he said, with few cases linked to mycoplasma.Koenig said school nurses alerted his agency to unusually high numbers of sick students, spurring further investigation and news releases about the pneumonia outbreak. He said those announcements were meant to encourage health providers to test children coming in with symptoms and to encourage parents to be vigilant about hand washing and keeping kids home when sick — not to warn the nation.The fall and winter respiratory season is typically a tough time for children’s hospitals and pediatric offices, but doctors say they worry more about RSV, influenza and covid than pneumonia.Jason Terk, a pediatrician in Texas, said he has treated several suspected mycoplasma pneumonia cases in the last six weeks, which is not out of the norm.“This is a bacterial infection and will sporadically cause clusters of cases,” Terk said. “I don’t think this is on the freaking out scale for most parents generally. Sometimes, when it is going around, awareness and concern may increase about it among parents.”Widespread media coverage of a pneumonia spike in western Massachusetts was dispelled Friday by pediatrician John Kelley, whose comments to a local news outlet about how children with RSV sometimes develop pneumonia were inaccurately reported as confirmation of a second outbreak. Kelley told The Washington Post he is not seeing unusual pneumonia trends or any parallels to China in his office. Massachusetts health officials said a statewide increase in pediatric pneumonia is expected this time of year, with no evidence suggesting a link to mycoplasma.Mycoplasma, which causes epidemics in countries every several years, is landing on the radar of pediatricians because it is re-emerging in parts of Europe and Asia for the first time since the covid-19 pandemic, according to a paper recently published in the Lancet journal.The researchers found mycoplasma was most frequently detected between April and October in Denmark, with Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland further behind.",6548,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/12/01/pneumonia-ohio-outbreak-white-lung-mycoplasma-china-europe/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y6ILSBHXZVSOGRXJRFX5JX7W64_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y6ILSBHXZVSOGRXJRFX5JX7W64_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y6ILSBHXZVSOGRXJRFX5JX7W64_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y6ILSBHXZVSOGRXJRFX5JX7W64_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y6ILSBHXZVSOGRXJRFX5JX7W64_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y6ILSBHXZVSOGRXJRFX5JX7W64_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,make increase cold unusually sick suspect creates disease country publish agency expect undue connection told northern unclear driven official warn europe pediatric mislead comment monitor authority worry independent koenig dangerous nurse child news daily reference refer cluster accelerate investigation fact terk common strain fairly antibiotic outlet importantly visit chest death pandemic breathing tough expert capacity scale data young elevate virus massachusetts vigilant lot week spur control physician land erroneously sweden coronavirus touch office director viral attract public normal swing medical pay evidence april center cough student prevention mandy respiratory rsv school widespread statewide kid radar epidemic fever caseload texas frequently severity continue develop full caution unusual typically experience cincinnati provider pneumoniae spread lung note hand october emergency stress bug cohen paper whatsoever winter encourage difficulty warren azithromycin cdc hospitalization instead denmark reach flu alert inaccurately detect home diagnosis local mix infant infect include sporadically hospital lancet term monitoring wash pathogen coverage level symptom runny dispel fine offit area found concern reporter diagnose doctor nationwide pneumonia time circulate number county august western link show due recently white syndrome clint atypical pediatrician china parent health describe professor attention accord freak bacteria influenza trend threshold report severe philadelphia heard remains age rise primary john syncytial walk year announcement infection bacterial ohio confirmation mycoplasma outsize outbreak nationally today singapore treat standard attribute season test release case type internationally familiar usual switzerland rate recover perception connect nose high state parallel typical suggest system spike medium researcher part fall resolve kelley potential covid washington percent department post illness childhood family routine awareness generally paul asia friday united meant pediatrics unknown,-0.9255,0.1374465485644471,11.770146678170832,0.3959594971238807,0,2023-12-01
Politico,GOP senators: Halt travel with China to stop ‘mystery illness’,2023-12-01 14:23:00,Shawn Zeller,"Five Republican senators wrote to President Joe Biden on Friday, asking him to restrict travel to and from China until more is known about a surge in cases of pneumonia among children there.The senators said a travel ban was needed because of China’s “long history of lying about public health crises” and because of the World Health Organization’s “slavish deference” to the country’s rulers.The WHO last month requested information on the outbreak, then held a teleconference with Chinese authorities in which officials said the pneumonia was caused by a common bacteria, mycoplasma, as well as seasonal viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and the flu.American public health experts seconded that assessment in interviews with POLITICO. They said it was likely that China, which only ended its Covid-19 lockdowns in January, was experiencing the same return of seasonal respiratory diseases that the U.S. and other nations did earlier.The WHO has advised against travel restrictions.But the Republican senators, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott of Florida, J.D. Vance of Ohio, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Mike Braun of Indiana, said that they didn’t trust the WHO or the Chinese.“A ban on travel now could save our country from death, lockdowns, mandates, and further outbreaks later,” they wrote.They cited former President Donald Trump’s decision to halt travel with China in January 2020. “History and common sense show his decision was the right one,” they wrote.The White House had no immediate comment on the letter.Though no prominent Democrats have echoed the call for a travel ban, some have expressed concern. Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin told POLITICO he was frustrated with China’s transparency and the information it was sharing. “We don’t know how reliable it is,” he said.And U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel urged China to be more forthcoming in a post to X last week: “It’s time to abandon COVID deception and delays as transparent and timely information saves lives,” he wrote.Carmen Paun and Alice Miranda Ollstein contributed to this story.",2084,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/01/republican-senators-china-travel-unknown-pathogen-00129638,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/4ee9c8a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6728x4485+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F55%2Ffd%2F6afd38514a1497d96d02e0b1ca37%2Fwho-china-pneumonia-60904.jpg,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lie history maryland urge president joe donald disease country chinese rick biden told rahm emanuel official include braun transparency comment republican prominent authority miranda ollstein alice concern ban child nation write pneumonia time rubio travel politico trust abandon story show cardin common white china advise health teleconference alabama january mandate trump delay death contribute bacteria world information marco immediate expert seasonal restrict ambassador forthcoming syncytial call florida echoed surge save virus long former week tuberville ohio reliable japan mycoplasma organization outbreak senator indiana request deception assessment public case share mike scott crisis deference respiratory return frustrate democrat covid vance house post interview tommy lockdown experience x transparent held slavish express month halt timely friday adenovirus paun decision life,-0.94955,0.0,10.579791666666663,0.3364718614718614,0,2023-12-01
NPR,"Avoid cantaloupe unless you know its origins, CDC warns amid salmonella outbreak",2023-12-01 09:55:00,Emily Olson,"U.S. food safety officials are urging consumers not to eat certain cantaloupe products, including some fruit cups, due to the risk of illness as they investigate a worsening outbreak of salmonella infections. The number of reported infections has nearly tripled in the two weeks since the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the outbreak, which appears to be linked to Malichita or Rudy brand cantaloupes. At least 117 people in 34 states have gotten sick from the bacteria, the CDC said in an update on Monday. At least 61 of them have been hospitalized and two have died. Canada is also investigating the outbreak. As of Nov. 24, health officials in the country had confirmed 63 cases across five provinces. At least 17 individuals had been hospitalized and one had died. Cantaloupes carrying salmonella may be seen with labels bearing the number ""4050"" and the term ""product of Mexico."" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hide caption The CDC advises against eating any cantaloupe or cantaloupe product that may have come from two brands — Malichita or Rudy. Whole cantaloupes from these brands might have stickers with the number ""4050"" and the phrase ""Product of Mexico/produit du Mexique."" Additionally, nine companies have recalled pre-cut cantaloupe products and other fruit medleys that may have used or touched Malichita or Rudy cantaloupes. Those companies include: The Canadian Food Inspection Agency expanded its recall notice to include some types of pineapples, watermelons and honeydew melons, which may have been processed alongside the recalled cantaloupe. In general, the CDC advises not to eat any pre-cut cantaloupe unless you're certain that Malchita or Rudy brands weren't used. ""This includes cantaloupe chunks and fruit mixes with cantaloupes at restaurants and grocery stores"" as well as items you might have bought last month and stored in your freezer, the CDC says. If you do find you purchased these products, health officials advise that you wash items and surfaces that may have touched the cantaloupe using hot, soapy water. People infected with salmonella usually experience diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps, with symptoms beginning between six hours and six days after consuming the bacteria. Most people recover four to seven days later. Children under 5 and seniors are at a higher risk of severe, sometimes fatal, illness. For this outbreak, at least 29% of those interviewed by the CDC were children under 5; 50% were 65 years or older. The true number of people made sick by this outbreak is ""likely much higher than the number reported"" because many people recover without medical care, the CDC says. Public health officials estimate that salmonella causes about 1.35 million illnesses, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the U.S. every year. In addition to the cantaloupe-related outbreak, the CDC is currently investigating lesser outbreaks linked to diced onions, dry dog food and small pet turtles.

Washington Post,GOP lawmakers grill CDC director on China’s respiratory virus spike,2023-11-30 15:01:00,Fenit Nirappil,"In her first appearance before Congress as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mandy Cohen faced a barrage of questions Thursday from Republicans about a new spike in respiratory illness in China and whether the agency had erred in its early recommendations to contain the coronavirus.The hearing represented one of Cohen’s first public opportunities to restore trust in the agency, which became a punching bag for Republicans who opposed school closures, vaccine mandates and masking requirements in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Cohen’s appearance came as clusters of pneumonia in Chinese children emerge as the latest public health issue enmeshed in geopolitical conflict.GOP lawmakers cast the rising viral activity as suspicious and reminiscent of the early days of the pandemic. But Cohen joined other public health experts in describing the situation as the usual fluctuations of any respiratory virus season.“We do not believe this is a new or novel pathogen,” Cohen testified before the House panel that oversees the CDC.She said the increase was driven by familiar threats: covid-19, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and mycoplasma, a bacterium that can infect the lungs.Experts say what’s happening in China could be the result of children susceptible to pathogens they were not exposed to while social distancing to avoid covid. It was a trend observed around the world, including in the United States last year amid an unusual RSV surge. China finally eased its strict covid restrictions starting December 2022, long after other countries did so.“You have three years’ worth of those individuals as kindling for these respiratory viruses,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “It makes biological sense, and it’s not surprising given many countries in the world experienced this last year.”Authorities from China’s National Health Commission in November attributed the rise in respiratory illnesses to known pathogens and the lifting of coronavirus restrictions.Republican members of Congress said assurances from the Chinese government should not be trusted, especially after Chinese officials had shared little information about the emerging coronavirus threat from Wuhan.“It brings us back, sadly, to the early days of covid-19,” said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the CDC. “The lack of reliable information coming out of China is a troubling parallel to 2020.”But public health experts who have been critical of China’s opaque response to covid say they do not see such a parallel.“Both things can be true: China can be deceptive, China can be very opaque and China can withhold lots of information, but it also could be this outbreak is ordinary,” Adalja said.Cohen told the panel that CDC staff members who work in China have reported there is no novel pathogen at play. She said this was corroborated by “other sources from our European Union partners and others to make sure that we are getting a complete picture.” CDC spokespeople did not immediately elaborate on what sort of corroborating information Cohen was referring to.The World Health Organization says it has asked China to share more epidemiological and clinical information about the clusters of pneumonia in children. Lawmakers who distrust the WHO after its dealings with China during covid called on the Biden administration to do more.“We are hoping that you can put some pressure in an attempt to try to get China to not mislead the world as they did with covid-19,” Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations that conducted the hearing, told Cohen.Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said there is no evidence so far to suggest the Chinese government’s explanation for the latest respiratory virus uptick lacks credibility. But he says concerns about health information sharing after covid remain valid, noting agreements that came out of the recent meeting between President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping did not include public health.“The problem remains there, so we cannot just categorically take wholesale what the government says,” Huang said. “There’s no serious dialogue between the two governments on how they should be cooperating with each other.”As the United States experiences its own rise in respiratory viruses, Cohen said the agency projects a similar level of hospitalizations as last season. She said RSV is nearing its peak, but flu season is just starting in most of the country and covid continues to be the primary driver of hospitalizations for respiratory illness with 15,000 admissions a week.",4819,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/30/cdc-china-respiratory-virus/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,partner leader lack information activity kindle susceptible threat source bacterium project explanation social griffith suspicious administration pandemic testify union specialist reminiscent health united december chinese center rise make year spokespeople level back dealing commission result trouble geopolitical infect oversees mandate john agreement xi withhold panel wholesale represent include observe expose viral punch experienced strict expert government late recommendation evidence familiar amid usual distance epidemiological dialogue remain err reliable especially mycoplasma hop mislead morgan opaque trust prevention describe start coronavirus long complete continue security call oversight agency share report november rodgers hearing flu valid organization hopkins china barrage issue energy mandy meeting thursday happen congress influenza jinping question note credibility suggest peak primary worth vaccine european foreign driven subcommittee emerge uptick biological pressure attempt republican finally spike restore chairman contain believe fellow country similar school hospitalization state remains parallel cluster clinical categorically enmesh biden president global sort early oppose season national work assurance scholar lift official house investigation deceptive appearance brings director told attribute council unusual conduct cdc give put closure child elaborate experience distrust relation trend respiratory sadly cast committee refer pneumonia mcmorris opportunity surge requirement world public authority pathogen driver ease admission member cooperate ordinary syncytial corroborate commerce illness outbreak play huang lot restriction problem cohen mask avoid senior critical control disease week fluctuation concern chair join individual cathy response recent virus amesh rsv covid bag lawmaker surprising increase day staff adalja situation immediately,-0.20765,0.0622535795808259,12.121940828402362,0.3834289868380777,0,2023-11-30

CNN,"From ‘menty b’ to ‘grippy socks,’ internet slang is taking over how we talk about mental health",2023-11-30 12:11:00,Leah Asmelash,"In the midst of vacation planning, Natalie Williams was feeling overwhelmed.Life was hectic, and booking a trip was at the bottom of a to-do list already flooded with other various tasks and obligations. She wasn’t even sure if she still wanted to go. Still, her friends asked: When are we booking this?“When I get stressed, it can be pretty debilitating,” Williams told CNN. “This one was just like, ‘I don’t even have time to think about going on a vacation.’”So she went on X, formerly known as Twitter, wrote a message and hit post: “The only vacation I’m open to taking rn is a grippy sock vacation.”The post was meant to be tongue-in-cheek. “Grippy sock vacation” refers to a stay in a psychiatric hospital, where patients are often given grippy socks. Williams didn’t actually want to stay at a psychiatric hospital, but her stress was real.Williams, a 27-year-old DJ in Philadelphia who goes by Prosper., said she often uses humor as a coping mechanism for real-life struggles. She and her friends use the phrase “grippy sock vacation” a lot, she said.And she isn’t the only one. In recent years, phrases like this have become ubiquitous, particularly online: “stressy depressy,” short for stressed and depressed, “menty b,” short for mental breakdown, and “suey,” short for suicidal, are just some of the jokey shorthand people have begun using to talk about mental health and mental illness.On one hand, using these terms can help destigmatize mental illness, making light of a usually dark circumstances and providing a way to talk about mental health without fear of reprimand.That can be a positive.But for Dr. Nicholas Westers, a clinical psychologist at Children’s Medical Center Dallas, simply talking about mental health isn’t always a good thing. How you talk about it matters, too, he said. And the use of these phrases, he said, can have some downsides.“Grippy sock chic,” Erikka Nelson, 43, posted on X, with an image of her in a hospital bed. Nelson, to be clear, was just making a joke about a recent surgery — she was not in a psychiatric facility, nor has she ever been. But she has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, Nelson told CNN, and has had her share of mental health struggles.For Nelson, using this type of language helps bring levity to the situation. It’s way to share a struggle without being “mundane or downtrodden,” she said. And it helps her feel seen — by sharing personal challenges online, people realize it’s not all rainbows and sunshine for everyone.“I think it can help, to where it’s like ‘I’m not the only person going through this,’” Nelson said.Even in comments, Nelson said she sees people making connections and helping each other feel less alone.A 55-year-old cab driver in New York said using this type of lingo might also be a way to build community with people similar to you, who may be going through the same thing. They made a post on X about taking a grippy sock vacation, and said they have struggled with mental illness throughout life. They spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of these topics.“A lot of my jokes are centered around mental illness, LGBTQ, or neurodivergent related jokes, which means that most of my followers are within one of those three categories,” they said.“I think younger people do this unintentionally by adopting online lingo that would only be really understood by specific groups of people, meaning people outside of those groups are less likely to see let alone interact with those posts.”But the potential benefits aren’t just for people who have a diagnosable disorder. Even for those who may not struggle with mental illness, Nelson said the commonality of this type of language might help them realize the importance of taking care of their mental health.“Mental health is part of your physical health, and I think the internet, social media, has definitely played a part in that (association),” she said.Of course, using these phrases can help destigmatize mental illness and mental health issues, Westers, the clinical psychologist, said. Acknowledging what they’re experiencing may even help people actually address their mental health and seek the help they need.That being said, such language could have the opposite effect, too. Using these phrases could be a way for some people to distance themselves from the experience using humor, Westers said.While that can be a coping mechanism, Westers said research shows that using these avoidant strategies is often done by people who have self-labeled or self-identified a mental illness, without a diagnosis from a doctor. People who have self-labeled or self-identified are also less likely to seek help via therapy or counseling, Westers said, but more likely to seek medication.Westers used depression as an example. Saying something like “the depresh got me” could be a sign that a person is distancing themselves from the symptoms. And if that person hasn’t actually been diagnosed with depression, they could be more likely to seek medication rather than go to counseling or therapy first, which makes overcoming their circumstances more difficult.Using these terms can also eliminate personal control from the experience, making it seem like the person is powerless against the situation.“So, ‘I’m having a menty b’ — well, there’s no control there,” Westers said. “That reflects very little control over the distress and doesn’t reflect any pursuit of healthy coping strategies.”There’s also concern that these terms could lead to a trivialization of serious mental health issues, Westers said.Making a quip like “I’m going to kill myself” when feeling down or “I’m so OCD” when you just like organization can also create stigmatization around mental health, Westers said. That extends to these internet shorthands.“These trivial uses of these kinds of terms can really minimize and invalidate people that really struggle,” Westers said.With minimization can also come overinterpretation. Someone going through sadness after a breakup — a relatively common and normal experience — may now think they’re depressed, Westers said, when actually they’re experiencing heartbreak. Applying a clinical label to a saddening situation can make it even more difficult to differentiate when a situation is actually serious, Westers said, and could also inadvertently enforce stigma.All of this signals that there are limits to the jokes, even if they are also coping mechanisms — a point when the funny is no longer funny and real consequences can occur.Williams, the DJ struggling with planning a vacation, noted that sometimes, using these cutesy phrases can be a way for people to slip their pain under the rug. Mental health resources, including therapy, aren’t always accessible, she said, and using these little sayings or words could be a way “to help them get through.” But that can also be a problem.“In my personal experiences with my friends, sometimes I don’t even know that they’re going through stuff because people mask it, or people aren’t able to say, ‘Hey, I’m having a really hard time and I need a friend right now,’” Williams said.In the past, Westers said, mental health was so stigmatized that people never talked about it, for fear of being sent to an institution or being considered “crazy.” Now, the pendulum seems to be swinging — and yet the consequences are still there.“It’s possible that our culture is moving to the other extreme, where we’re going to trivialize it and destigmatize it so much; everyone’s going to talk about it using fun language,” Westers said.And that, he said, can be just as bad.",7625,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/30/health/menty-b-social-media-language-wellness-cec/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point accessible strategy jokey lingo pursuit image effect post acknowledge type social possible nature health rn dallas trivialize make center real nicholas sign refers year matter clear sadden levity feel medium mechanism fear ubiquitous interact part resource internet funny include fun extreme inadvertently definitely bottom understood follower spoke hit distance sunshine overinterpretation time relatively adopt formerly downtrodden course cnn distress depression physical reflect hand message provide apply planning b powerless community address depressy personal move share simply psychologist light psychiatric sensitive sadness stress mental medical cutesy past organization wester facility bed mundane minimize minimization diagnose eliminate trivial particularly issue menty signal sock nelson trip lgbtq diagnosis task depresh pain humor association suicidal diagnosable patient talk pendulum quip write philadelphia note x open challenge stigmatize commonality specific anonymity meant cop anxiety bring dj longer category opposite doctor trivialization played seek difficult hospital midst surgery limit importance depressed obligation heartbreak connection similar hectic book hard clinical comment york disorder symptom invalidate stressy begin kind person struggle related potential life therapy consequence realize rug told research swing cab breakup healthy shorthand online young give destigmatize label child experience neurodivergent ocd friend flood debilitate breakdown unintentionally normal stuff dark overcome pretty build consider joke phrase list word twitter differentiate stay language lead vacation driver show common extends meaning suey benefit erikka enforce illness circumstance kill lot institution rainbow mask hey grippy term short control slip concern chic group counsel recent culture natalie create condition situation avoidant medication stigmatization williams,0.1349,0.1573770491803278,8.482539682539684,0.4202620328788551,0,2023-11-30
NPR,What works for treating the common cold? Many doctors say 'not much',2023-11-30 06:00:00,Lesley McClurg,"Doctors and researchers question the efficacy of many common over-the-counter treatments for colds and flus. When you stroll down the cold and flu aisle in a drugstore, it's easy to get lost in the dizzying array of products promising to clear sinus pressure, dry up sniffles and stop plaguing coughs. Some concoctions even offer it all in one magical pill. But doctors say the science behind some of those claims is lackluster. ""There's just not much that's very effective for treating the common cold,"" said Dr. Lauren Eggert, clinical assistant professor in the Pulmonary Allergy and Critical Care Division at Stanford University. ""Most of the things out there — antihistamines, decongestants, cough medicines — none of them have a lot of evidence that they're super effective at improving cough or common cold symptoms."" Headlines blasted that message in September when advisers to the FDA found oral phenylephrine, which is an active ingredient in some Sudafed, Mucinex, and Dayquil products, is simply not effective. The review was prompted by inquiries dating back nearly a decade. And pharmacists say that concerns over effectiveness could extend down the aisle. Half a dozen medical experts interviewed for this story raised questions about other cold and flu ingredients, including other common cough suppressants and expectorants. ""There could well be products that are on the market containing ingredients about which people could legitimately have questions and which the agency has had a difficult time acting on because of the elaborateness of the regulatory process,"" said Dr. Peter Lurie, the president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer watchdog group. Many of the ingredients on store shelves today were grandfathered in more than 50 years ago, when the science backing many drugs did not meet the rigor of today's methodologies. This means companies have been able to create new products using those ingredients without testing their effectiveness. ""Back in those days, statistics were not very developed,"" said Dr. Leslie Hendeles, PharmD, professor emeritus at the University of Florida in Gainesville, who was one of the petitioners who prompted the recent FDA review. ""The whole concept of clinical trials and study design was in its infancy."" But most of these drugs have remained on store shelves unquestioned, thanks to the FDA's laborious drug review process. Reforms included in the 2020 CARES Act streamline requirements. Prior to these reforms, updating or changing a drug's approval status required FDA notice-and-comment rulemaking, which is slow and burdensome. Now a much simpler administrative order is required. The law also provides the FDA with the authority to collect user fees from drug manufacturers. The new funds are intended to provide the agency with adequate staffing to implement new drug reviews and removals. For example, pharmacists like Hendeles submitted a citizen's petition to the FDA to review oral phenylephrine back in 2007. This year's vote is the new law's first test case. In the future it should not take 16 years for a drug review to unfold. ""The message here is that there are a lot of products on the market that fall into the same category as phenylephrine,"" said Hendeles. ""They're not for diseases where people die or have to go to an emergency room. So they have not gotten the attention — even from the FDA — until now."" He believes regulators will likely find other futile over-the-counter drugs as they review older medications. ""I know for sure that the cough suppressants and the expectorants are next in line."" He points to a compilation of data he presented in a 2018 paper published in the journal Allergy and Asthma Proceedings, where he concluded the claims on many OTC products marketed for respiratory symptoms are overblown. And the existing evidence for decongestants, expectorants and cough suppressants does not ""justify their use."" Eggert agrees. She opens a database called UpToDate, which physicians use as a resource when they want to see the summary of evidence for medications targeting specific concerns. The conclusions for cold and flu remedies are disconcerting: NPR reached out to the FDA to clarify whether the agency is planning to review some of these drugs. The agency did not provide comment or make anyone available for an interview after numerous requests. Industry groups like the Consumer Healthcare Product Association are pushing the agency to keep oral phenylephrine available to drugstores, even though CVS stores have already started pulling oral decongestants containing phenylephrine as the only active ingredient. In an email, they defended the FDA's current review process saying it ensures that cold and flu medications are safe and effective. Additionally, in a statement, they argue that ""decreased choice and availability of these products would be placed directly onto consumers and an already-strained U.S. healthcare system."" For now, Eggert recommends consumers use products with the best evidence like acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain or nasal sprays to clear the nose. And, she does not suggest tossing anything else out of your medicine cabinet. ""If you've used something and you felt like it was helpful, I don't think there's a problem with that,"" said Eggert. ""There's little harm for people who are looking for relief. And I do believe in the placebo effect."" But it may be best to avoid concoctions that promise to treat many symptoms at once. Single-ingredient products will help lower the possibility for side effects, according to Dr. Shalini Lynch, PharmD, health sciences clinical professor at UCSF's School of Pharmacy. She says it should be obvious in a day or two if the product is relieving a desired symptom. She also suggests a few natural remedies. Saline nasal rinses may help clear your sinuses and honey can quell your cough. Additionally, it may be worth standing in a steamy shower or filling your humidifier to open your nasal passages. However, Lynch says cozying up on the couch may be your best bet. ""The common cold is something that pretty much needs to run its course,"" she said. ""You want to feel better instantly. But the reality is most cough and cold, viral types of upper respiratory infections, just take time to go away.""",6309,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/11/30/1215702921/what-works-for-treating-the-common-cold-many-doctors-say-not-much,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,story point run company tylenol improve ingredient effect ucsf pharmacy remedy data fill type emergency cough journal otc ensures health review shower center florida make steamy year clear back manufacturer act feel developed petitioner industry directly cozying researcher healthcare science relieve assistant lynch treatment resource order active paper include drugstore viral clarify change expert request rinse effective statement backing pill evidence prompt choice administrative compilation promise removal remain pull burdensome decongestant time decrease mucinex nose update relief implement citizen system shelf today interview course oral unfold quell cabinet natural antihistamine find consumer start blast accord message provide overblown placebo honey planning interviewed possibility call recommends agency side couch simply meet easy lose claim current flu available asthma medical bet stanford rulemaking plague rigor dozen slow harm pulmonary pain association petition safe regulator cold sinus found instantly conclusion extend intend aisle statistic question toss open suggest market fall university headline specific worth email dry desire category additionally doctor npr collect uptodate date adequate justify difficult interest pressure stop promising future contain believe passage phenylephrine away unquestioned prior adviser school present spray database concoction require clinical place saline target comment suppressant streamline symptom president inquiry concept raise offer conclude design futile fda pharmd ago felt dizzy infancy disconcert humidifier vote watchdog lurie leslie status upper allergy medicine emeritus shalini infection suggests sniffle acetaminophen respiratory attention hendeles approval reach expectorant methodology lauren division room exist pretty simpler test half cv requirement argue reform obvious publish public product authority low reality pharmacist lackluster common law user agrees store professor helpful array decade lot regulatory nasal problem case summary avoid legitimately critical treat gainesville disease submit physician availability dayquil sudafed fee numerous concern line trial defend group september laborious recent proceeding elaborateness magical process stroll effectiveness day study create eggert staff grandfathered stand medication efficacy push super fund,0.9825,0.0,9.77545611015491,0.4840879358736499,0,2023-11-30
CNN,WHO keeping closer watch on BA.2.86 strain as a dearth of data makes predictions difficult,2023-11-29 21:45:00,Brenda Goodman,"The World Health Organization has notched up the status of the coronavirus strain BA.2.86 and its offshoots, naming it a “variant of interest,” although the organization says the current risk from this family of viruses appears to be low.Previously, the organization had been following this lineage as a “variant under monitoring.”WHO also has XBB.1.5, XBB.1.6 and EG.5 classified as variants of interest. There are no current variants of concern, the highest designation.BA.2.86 first turned up in the US in August and is now the third most common variant, causing an estimated 1 in 11 new cases of Covid-19 here, according to the latest update of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s variant tracker. The prevalence appears to have tripled in the past two weeks, although a variant’s growth is often overestimated in the first few weeks after it shows up in the CDC’s monitoring.But if BA.2.86 doesn’t appear to be such big deal, why would WHO upgrade it?“We’ve seen a slow and steady increase in its detection around the world,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, in a video posted on social media. “By characterizing it as a variant of interest really helps to promote surveillance for these types of variants around the world as well as to stimulate research” to understand whether they cause more severe disease or are more immune-evasive, she said.BA.2.86, which some virus watchers have dubbed Pirola, triggered a flurry of research when it came to the world’s attention over the summer because it shared many of the characteristics that caused BA.1, the original Omicron strain of the coronavirus, to spread like wildfire, prompting hospitalizations and deaths to spike globally.With more than 30 mutations to its spike proteins, BA.2.86 was so genetically distinct from previous versions of the virus that causes Covid-19 that scientists had feared it might completely slip past the immunity of vaccinations and infections to fuel another wave of infections.But perplexingly, BA.2.86 never really took off the same way the first Omicron did. Some studies suggested that as it developed all its new mutations, this variant lost some of its ability to infect our cells, slowing its growth.Other studies found that it didn’t completely evade the body’s immunity and that the current Covid-19 vaccine, which carries instructions on fighting the XBB.1.5 subvariant, offered some protection against it, which was good news.Variant hunters have tempered that optimism, however, by warning that even if the original BA.2.86 virus was more lamb than lion, it was still evolving, and one of its descendants might gain back enough fitness to become a force to be reckoned with.Indeed, BA.2.86 continues to evolve and send fitter offspring into the world, says Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.Bloom says work by researchers at Columbia University and in China has shown that the JN.1 subvariant has one change to its genetic code that makes it more capable of escaping our immune defenses, although the difference is modest: about a twofold decrease in the ability of our antibodies to neutralize the virus.Still, that tweak seems to have been enough to give it a growth advantage over its predecessor.“As far as fitness, what we can see is that JN.1 is increasing in numbers faster than its parent, BA.2.86,” Bloom said.At the same time, the distantly related XBB family of viruses, which now includes several faster and fitter descendants like HV.1, is rising in prevalence. HV.1 is currently the dominant lineage in the US, according to the CDC, causing an average of about 1 in 3 new cases of Covid-19.“From a scientific perspective, all these variants are kind of currently on the move, and I could see either family spreading. What exactly it’s going to mean, for Covid case counts and Covid disease burden this winter, is hard to say,” Bloom said.Overseas, a number of countries have seen case numbers go up as BA.2.86 and JN.1 have spread, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.“In Europe, it has been associated in several countries with big increasing number of cases, and other countries it hasn’t, so what gives?” he said.Europe used to be a good barometer for what Covid-19 might do in the US, but immunity, behavior and surveillance are so different from country to country now that it’s tough to know what might happen here.One big problem is that data is dwindling, says Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital who developed a vaccine against Covid-19.“It’s harder to read the tea leaves than it used to be because we’re not doing as much surveillance, so you have to base [predictions] on a hodgepodge of things like wastewater and hospital admissions and percent positivity,” Hotez said.Still, taking into account the signs we can see, Hotez says, there’s reason for caution in the weeks ahead.Covid-19 hospitalizations, which had been dropping, have started to nudge back up again. Last week, more than 18,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19, about a 10% increase over the week prior, according to CDC data. Nationally, coronavirus levels in wastewater are high and appear to be increasing, which may portend rising case numbers.At the same time, a paltry 16% of American adults and just 6% of kids have gotten the latest Covid-19 vaccine, which studies have shown robustly boosts antibodies against the XBB family of viruses and provides some protection against the BA.2.86 family, though to a lesser extent.A recent study by microbiologist and immunologist Dr. David Ho and his lab at Columbia University found that although last year’s booster – which carried instructions to stave off two versions of the virus that causes Covid-19, the original strain and BA.5 – didn’t seem to really retune our immunity to fight off the latest variants the way scientists hoped it would, this year’s single-strain shot really is all that and a bag of chips.The strategy of going back to a single-strain shot and boosting against the strongest leading variant seems to have paid off, raising antibodies about 27-fold against the current crop of variants, including JN.1.Bloom says this is great news because it means the strategy of tweaking the recipe for the Covid-19 vaccine each year should continue to help blunt the worst outcomes of infections, as long as people get their shots.But the low uptake means there’s a bigger pool of adults and children who may be susceptible to breakthrough infections and reinfections with Covid-19.“I think we could see the numbers start to increase as we head into the holiday season,” Hotez said. “We’ve got to redouble our efforts to get more Americans to take this booster. I think that’s the single most important action item right now.”",6970,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/health/covid-ba-2-86-variant-of-interest/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,directs news immunity modest strategy version outcome michael subvariant susceptible post triple protein spread tough item data social type pediatric growth promote shot advantage blunt specialist optimism health american adult virologist detection center make rise hunter sign important great year difference fitness bloom level back technical fuel deal medium developed infect fear researcher temper characteristic scientist turn redouble include severe pool hodgepodge change burden late europe lineage perplexingly prompt evade cell reason time decrease descendant hutchinson count update hop escape microbiologist estimate maria evolve prevention coronavirus start long big paid accord behavior kerkhove provide dubbed trigger continue family immunologist classify read paltry wildfire move share code associate ability hospitalize lose genetic current past summer organization surveillance china prevalence single slow antibody retune faster lesser august drop happen steady found action capable jesse suggest texas strain number university characterize fitter osterholm perspective vaccine dwindle pirola high overestimate percent interest tea hospital wastewater xbb lamb scientific spike stave tracker currently notch policy reckon country infectious force prior parent hospitalization prediction instruction lion reinfections hard holiday robustly harder effort neutralize understand kind flurry strong send raise offer original related season work base hotez barometer variant wave protection research watcher kid genetically baylor crop status carry cdc medicine give omicron infection death boost child columbia attention nationally risk caution recipe offshoot distinct mutation breakthrough world upgrade leaf low lead stimulate show head portend admission account common different video dominant follow previous defense cancer average fred vaccination problem case distantly control uptake slip disease week offspring nudge tweak concern completely computational immune booster body david recent virus college positivity covid bag fight warn increase study twofold lab winter,0.96755,0.1291248206599713,10.335157571099156,0.3910598250546703,0,2023-11-29
CNN,Experts explain the damage labeling ‘Pick-me’ girls can do,2023-11-29 19:26:00,Terry Ward,"Amy often picks up the latest tween terminology during middle school drop-off for her two daughters, ages 11 and 12.“They were talking about a fellow student, and how she was so annoying because she’s a total ‘pick-me girl,’” the Florida mother of two said.Her daughters were referencing the girls who say they’re not like other girls. “They’re more like one of the guys,” said Amy, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.The term is used to describe a girl who does everything for external, mostly male validation.“(She) puts her friends down in the process in a way that doesn’t seem like putting down her friends,” said clinical psychologist Regine Galanti, founder of the practice Long Island Behavioral Psychology in Long Island, New York, and the author of the young adult nonfiction book “Anxiety Relief for Teens.““It’s hard to identify people who identify as a pick-me girl because it’s seen as a bit of an insult,” Galanti said. “Nobody comes in to see me and says, ‘Hey I’m a pick-me girl.’ They’re like, ‘Someone called me one, and this is why it’s not true.’”Pick-me girl name-calling has been described as problematic and misogynistic and has even given rise to an anti-pick-me trend on social media.Galanti said the fact that the term has so much traction on social media platforms hardly helps people being targeted by it.“Someone who’s going for the external validation of the guy they’re with, it’s not an ideal situation,” she said. “Most of them will probably outgrow it … but now we’ve made them a meme, and it’s going to make them feel worse for doing it.”The term has been traced to a 2005 episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” during which Ellen Pompeo’s character Meredith Grey begged Patrick Dempsey’s character Derek Shepherd to choose her over his wife with the line, “Pick me. Choose me. Love me.”More recently, the #pickmegirl hashtag has been trending on social media, with more than 3.4 billion views. The #tweetlikeapickme first gained traction on X (the website formerly known as Twitter) in 2016, according to Women’s Media Center.Social media memes mock pick-me girls with lines like “‘I’ll have pizza, not like my friends who only eat salad,’ and ‘I like baking cookies. I don’t know why other girls don’t like it,’ are an exaggeration of the trope,” Galanti said.“Having people throw it on TikTok as a meme makes the situation that much worse, for girls being accused of being pick-me girls,” she said.And that’s because the underlying feelings attached to the meme are real.“One of the main challenges of adolescence is figuring out who you are. It’s an identity crisis, literally,” Galanti said. “To find out who you are, you have to try on different identities.”She explained that teens often consider it socially OK to change yourself a little bit to impress the people you’re trying to fit in with, but if you’re too obvious about it, then you’re a pick-me girl.“They’re trying to figure out who they are, and people are saying who they are is just someone looking for validation all the time from other people,” Galanti said. “And now they have to change that and get your validation instead.”Ultimately, these girls are just trying to fit in. And labeling them as pick-me girls is an insult that should be avoided, Galanti said.“I believe it’s important to approach this topic with empathy and understanding,” said life coach Bayu Prihandito, founder of online coaching service, Life Architekture.“People, especially young women as they continue to grow up, have to navigate a society filled with mixed messages about their worth, identity, and the roles they are expected to play,” he noted via email. “And you have social media, the usual suspect, amplifying these messages and creating an environment where external validation is not just sought after but often seems necessary.”Prihandito encourages a more compassionate and understanding conversation around the ‘pick-me girl’ phenomenon, one that veers away from judgment and toward genuine support and empowerment.The term can be especially harmful for girls who are genuinely interested in the things they’re being ridiculed for, Galanti said.“If you do like sports or sitting around with the guys and drinking beer, it puts you in this double bind where being yourself makes you a pick-me girl,” she said. “So it seems like another way that young girls are putting each other down.”Most pick-me girls, however, are not out to put down other women, Galanti said.“They’re out to fit in with another group,” she said. “So, calling them out on that just makes them wonder, ‘What do I do now?’”",4600,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/health/pick-me-girls-wellness/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,meme environment episode fill social double bit pickmegirl adult role rise florida make important dempsey insult pizza feel medium hashtag interested island platform outgrow recently change student ultimately late drinking salad usual phenomenon woman time especially relief formerly reference misogynistic cooky regine website find beer describe navigate male long accord message continue anatomy call wonder share love author psychologist amy middle sought society external tweetlikeapickme privacy coach traction service throw identity beg probably shepherd approach prihandito adolescence ideal pompeo sport underlie terminology feeling talk accuse crisis view x note challenge worth anxiety email founder problematic attach mixed billion expect girl validation compassionate guy galanti practice empathy believe fellow grey patrick away school trace book harmful character hard clinical suspect target york annoy understand veers trope derek bind age life figure identify choose topic conversation online young put give label trend friend tiktok nonfiction baking consider total genuine literally twitter mock obvious daughter decline different pick socially play meredith impress described mother eat hey term avoid bayu grow genuinely exaggeration psychology encourages line group wife explain fit ridicule fact tween process amplify create support behavioral situation judgment,0.7016,0.0652173913043478,6.821104294478527,0.4259776334776334,0,2023-11-29

Washington Post,"My husband died recently, and now my 6-year-old is acting out",2023-11-29 06:00:00,Meghan Leahy,"Q: My husband died four months ago, and he was my 6-year-old daughter’s absolute best buddy. Since that time, she has been kind of hurting her 2-year-old sister, melting down and refusing to do anything except grunt or whine. She will not let me or anyone else (grandparents) talk to, hug or console her, and she keeps moving away from anyone that tries to talk to her at all. No one is punishing her, we talk about her dad often and positively, we collect feathers and coins and tell the sky “Thank you, daddy,” and are very aware that she’s grieving.I’m a mental health practitioner, so I know what the books say to do, and she’s in therapy. She also lies about silly things like taking her vitamins and then has a meltdown if she gets (lovingly) caught in said lie. She also looks at me like she wishes it was me who passed, which is fine. I totally get it. He was her world and she was so attached to him. I just don’t know how to get her to stop hurting her little sister. Her sister can’t really talk yet, but I know my daughter’s lying tone/face — she’s not very good at concealing anything. When she melts down, I give her space and let her know that I’m here for her when she’s ready. If I catch her, I will hug her and tell her I’m here, but she’ll most often push me away and run away. She’s never been like this before, and I know why she’s doing it, but what else can I do to help her?A: Oh my, I am so sorry for this terrible loss. Not only have you lost your partner, but you have to watch your 6-year-old suffer, which is also gut-wrenching. And here’s the funny thing about being a mental health practitioner and a parent: You know enough to understand what you are seeing, thanks to education and practical experience, but you are also in deep personal grief. What you’ve learned about emotions and children is easy to forget when the pain is so great, and it is human for overwhelm to take over. In terms of what you can do to help her, let’s unpack why children lie, melt down, hurt siblings and seem to regress when they are in deep grief.When a child is 6 years old, they are often — but not always — in a developmental in-between place. Their brain has taken huge leaps in maturity: They are able to wait, take turns, communicate their needs (mostly), have and maintain compassion for others, and they understand the permanence of death.But they are still little. They need to find refuge in the people they love after a long day, they still believe in magic and, while friends are increasingly important, it is their primary caretakers who soothe and help them grow. Children at this age will still have tantrums, growth spurts and regressions, and it is typical for 6-year-olds to be quite bright and still clutch their lovies.Because your daughter is old enough to understand loss, she feels the deep frustration and alarm of your husband’s death. After someone we love dies, our brain forgets about the death and keeps “looking” for the person who has passed. Are they at home? Will they be in bed? Will I see them at breakfast? But unlike an adult who can readily talk to themselves about themselves (thank you, prefrontal cortex), your daughter cannot consistently harness and control this alarm, frustration and confusion.She is old enough to not hurt strangers, but these big emotions come out sideways on her little sister, in meltdowns and in lies. I want you to imagine her as turned inside out, all raw endings and nerves. She is so raw that she is even grunting; the emotions cannot create words in her head. She can’t make sense of this stunning loss. We often forget in our culture that grief can be as much physical as it is mental, and that’s what’s happening with your child. Until her mind and body can begin to truly accept his passing, her behavior can skip around erratically. It is why adults binge TV, alcohol and work when we grieve; we do what we can to numb the erratic up and down nature of it all.I asked Laura Berman, a well-known relationship therapist (and mom who recently lost her own son), for her wisdom. While she feels that therapy for your child is wonderful, she also recommends you look into somatic experience therapy, which is becoming an increasingly promising method to treat trauma, though there is still more research to be done. “Somatic experiencing is different from play or talk therapy, as it is not about thinking and talking,” Berman says. “Instead, the clinician helps the child learn how to express painful emotions in a productive and contained way that leaves her feeling lighter and supported. Somatic experiencing will also teach her … how to begin self-regulating when she is feeling overwhelmed with painful emotions.”Berman believes this therapy can help your daughter process much of the grief-induced rage she is feeling.When it comes to your younger daughter, Berman recommends keeping “them separated as much as possible unless a trusted adult is with them and engaging them both. Your daughter probably really leaned on her dad after her little sister was born and you were naturally distracted. Now she has to share again, and it’s a constant reminder of what she has lost.” This will get better with time, she says, as your 6-year-old learns other ways to express her anger.You may be tempted to “discipline” or get your daughter to tell the truth, but allow strong boundaries to do the heavy-lifting here. That may mean calling on more friends and family so you can have more one-on-one time with each child. As you surely know, your 6-year-old doesn’t want to hurt her sister, so separating them for now is a kindness.Above all, Berman stresses that grief like this takes time to unfold. “It’s only been four months, which may seem like a lifetime from your perspective, but this kind of loss takes time for everyone to metabolize, much less a child who doesn’t have the maturity, perspective or vocabulary to express herself.”Meanwhile, as you protect your younger daughter and seek somatic work for your older daughter, be sure to support yourself. And as Erica Sonnabend, a grief recovery specialist, says: “Emotionally healing ourselves as adults gives us a greater capacity for guiding our children through their own grief journey.”In other words, you will be better able to manage your daughter’s grief process if you also are healing and taking care of yourself. I know that may feel like a tall order right now, but your healing matters for everyone.",6453,https://www.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2023/11/29/child-parent-death-grief/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,unpack partner suffer run express readily accept pass naturally growth separate possible loss nature spurt specialist learns teach health adult inside tall increasingly trauma make caught painful grandparent passing important great year wait matter feel lighter turn order funny wish recently mom binge alcohol huge laura time forgets maintain wisdom meltdown home fine conceal trust sonnabend unfold find terrible imagine physical alarm long feather big behavior family mind compassion coin call recommends personal move daddy share melt love overwhelmed forget hurt stun magic lose easy catch emotionally stress mental method sibling aware silly distract bed refuge probably truth whine heal pain rage tempt learn happen talk deep stranger maturity harness space primary practitioner ready perspective month nerve attach clutch collect numb instead skip husband sideways sorry seek absolute developmental prefrontal reminder stop promising contain believe away regress brain unlike positively parent typical metabolize book communicate place erica therapist begin understand productive kind strong person protect relationship age work tv refuse soothe regression frustration permanence therapy surely ago hug boundary ending research born totally young give death child experience sky friend vocabulary wonderful console berman capacity word world grief leaf lovingly tantrum punish daughter head different breakfast overwhelm grunt caretaker vitamin practical play buddy dad cortex term erratically leap emotion grow grieve control treat erratic clinician guide engage constant lie bright body recovery culture somatic lifetime raw process human day create consistently lean sister support discipline manage education dy push watch,0.9849,0.0464900046490004,6.478396436525614,0.5224478744525916,0,2023-11-29
NPR,How can we break the cycle of childhood trauma? Help a baby's parents,2023-11-29 05:01:00,Rhitu Chatterjee,"Teresa Cox-Bates was only 11 years old when her father died, an event that dramatically altered her family's circumstances and shaped her childhood experiences. ""I really remember us not having enough food to eat,"" says Cox-Bates, 37. Her mother worked as a paralegal back then, but struggled financially. ""It was just hard. My mom was trying her best to provide everything, but it just wasn't enough."" She remembers not having clean clothes and eating only one meal on most days – and food could spark literal battles with her mom. ""If we snuck into the kitchen to get something, she'd beat us,"" she says, adding that her mother struggled with alcoholism in those days. ""So with little things, she'd just snap."" There was housing instability, too: ""I didn't stay anywhere long enough to even have a best friend."" The hardships Cox-Bates endured during childhood are what researchers call Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACES). Studies show they can leave a profound impact on the brains and bodies of kids, affecting their health as adults, increasing their risks for chronic health issues like heart disease, obesity, depression and suicide attempts. Studies also show that adults who experienced such traumas in childhood are likely to feel more stressed when they become parents, and their children are at a higher risk of developmental delays and mental health problems. When Cox-Bates became a mother, she knew she didn't want her children to experience what she and her siblings did. ""I wanted to provide something better for my kids,"" says Cox-Bates, who now has two sons, ages 10 and 6, and a 4-year-old daughter. She and her husband, John Bates, wanted to give their kids a childhood free of hunger, neglect and violence and one filled with stability, love and connection. Teresa Cox-Bates. Kholood Eid for NPR hide caption Teresa Cox-Bates. And they have been able to accomplish that, thanks to the support they received from their pediatrician's office through HealthySteps, a program for families with lower incomes who face more stressors from their financial circumstances. Often these are the people who are more likely to have experienced childhood traumas. HealthySteps helps families cultivate a healthy environment for their children in the earliest and most developmentally vulnerable age – 0 to 3 years – by connecting them with a child development specialist. The specialist meets one-on-one with parents during pediatric appointments, educating them about their child's development, and doing screenings to catch any problems early on. They also offer practical support, addressing families' social and psychological needs: whether it is to find appropriate care for a parent's own history of trauma, or to connect families to stable housing and food. HealthySteps is in nearly 250 American clinics. And research shows it is having a positive impact on families. Kholood Eid for NPR hide caption HealthySteps is in nearly 250 American clinics. And research shows it is having a positive impact on families. ""It's that kind of support that I think can disrupt that vicious cycle [of childhood traumas],"" says Dr. Kevin Fiori, a pediatrician and director of social determinants of health for Montefiore Health System. Nearly 250 clinics across the country use the program, mostly with philanthropic funding. They are reaching more than 370,000 children and seeing promising results. Cox-Bates signed up for HealthySteps in 2017 when her second son, Isaac, was a few months old. Until recently, when her youngest graduated from the program, HealthySteps has supported her through many ordinary and unusually stressful periods of parenting. ""If I didn't have [HealthySteps], I don't think I would have been able to manage my mental health and for me to even press on to be the mother that I am today,"" she says. When I meet Cox-Bates at her apartment in Brooklyn on a recent afternoon, she is sitting on the big red sectional in her living room, working on her laptop. Her two boys, Eli, 10, and Isaac, 6, are engrossed with a video game on the large TV, barely a few feet from their mother. Their sister, 4-year-old Ava is skipping around the room, eating strawberries, her beaded braids rising and falling with each step. Their mother, unperturbed by their noise and chaos, occasionally looks up from her computer to check on them. When Ava becomes upset about something, Cox-Bates sets aside her laptop and gently pulls her daughter onto her lap, hugging her, and whispering in her ear to calm her down. After her husband, John Bates, takes the children to a playground, she tells me she wasn't always as calm with her kids. When they were younger and always clamoring for her attention, she would feel easily overwhelmed. ""Sometimes I'd find myself getting so angry because I'd feel like I'm not doing enough,"" she says. ""They always want more."" She remembers snapping at her kids, then worrying that it ""was her mom coming out,"" she says. ""I didn't like it."" It was during times like these that she reached out to her HealthySteps specialist, Allison Lieber, who directs the HealthySteps program at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center. ""I would just call in, I would just talk to her even for 5 minutes, and I just felt better,"" says Cox-Bates. Teresa Cox-Bates and Allison Lieber, director of HealthySteps at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, say sometimes their check-ins were just five minute phone calls, but they helped Teresa cope with parenting stress. Kholood Eid for NPR hide caption Teresa Cox-Bates and Allison Lieber, director of HealthySteps at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, say sometimes their check-ins were just five minute phone calls, but they helped Teresa cope with parenting stress. Lieber, too, remembers those calls. ""There were definitely conversations about wanting to parent differently and not knowing how to get there,"" says Lieber. Cox-Bates also struggled with reading ""her kiddos' cues and how to deal with those big feelings that came up for her when someone was tantruming or having a hard time,"" Lieber adds. So, Lieber gave her tools to manage her own stress, like journaling, and regular self-care. She also gave her strategies to deal with her children's tantrums and meltdowns. ""She told me 'just think [that] these are little people, and they need more time to develop,'"" recalls Cox-Bates. That reminder has helped her become a calmer, more compassionate and nurturing mother. And she sees the results reflected in her children's happiness. ""They seem pretty happy."" A parent with a history of childhood traumas may not always know how to forge a loving, nurturing bond with their infant, says Fiori. ""Families that I work with haven't had a good [parenting] model,"" he says, ""either because they had challenges with their own parents not being there or not being in a setup to provide the kind of nurturing that they wanted."" So, they are more likely to use the kind of harsh parenting they grew up with, unless they're shown ways to do things differently, says Rahil Briggs, the national director for the program and a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ""Without intervention and without treatment and without help, we see these intergenerational cycles of trauma,"" she says. HealthySteps provides an alternative ""parenting model"" that is healthier for the parents and their children in the long run, says Fiori. A loving, responsive and nurturing relationship with a parent – what researchers call a secure attachment – is key to healthy childhood development, says Briggs. ""It's this incredibly predictive sense of a strong foundation moving forward,"" she says. ""If this foundation is strong, you're set up with some of those skills [needed to succeed in life]."" Those skills include language, communication and the social and emotional skills that help kids navigate day-to-day interactions with other people, she explains. John Bates plays with his daughter Ava, 4, and his son Eli, 10, at Brookdale Family Care Center's clinic in Brooklyn. The Bates family has been connected to the HealthySteps program for years. Kholood Eid for NPR hide caption John Bates plays with his daughter Ava, 4, and his son Eli, 10, at Brookdale Family Care Center's clinic in Brooklyn. The Bates family has been connected to the HealthySteps program for years. Fiori points to the landmark study on the long-term impacts of ACES, which also found that ""nurturing a healthy child-parent relationship, providing environments where a child and their caregiver can have those appropriate attachments and support"" can mitigate the health effects of childhood traumas. But when that secure parent-child bond is missing due to the parents' own history of trauma, or the stresses brought on by poverty, the child's development suffers. Briggs points to a 2009 study where U.S. researchers found that children 0-3 years of age who experienced neglect, physical, emotional or sexual abuse had significant developmental delays. ""If they had experienced seven or more kinds of trauma, the kids in that group, 100% of them had a developmental delay,"" says Briggs. ""Children who are spending all of their time and energy trying to stay safe, managing hunger, managing fear, a very stressful home – there's not a lot left to learn your ABCs."" Poverty, too, has serious developmental impacts. ""We see impacts on physical health, on developmental health,"" says Briggs. ""You're seeing illness, hospitalizations, developmental delays, increased behavior problems, decreased cognitive functioning."" HealthySteps is trying to prevent these health inequities and give at-risk kids a healthier start. And there's a growing recognition that a pediatrician's clinic is an obvious place to identify families who need extra support, says Dr. Tumaini Rucker Coker, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. ""For many families, that could be the only opportunity they have to address some of the social or psychosocial needs that they have,"" she says. The first few years of a child's life are also when parents need the most support, adds Rucker Coker, especially those who are struggling otherwise. ""They have a whole host of needs during that early childhood period, and it can range from social and financial needs, to support on the day-to-day things of being a new parent, like sleep, feeding and safety."" Studies also show that investing in children and their families in these early years has ""the biggest impact,"" says Fiori. Research shows that HealthySteps is already making a difference. Children enrolled in the program are more likely to attend all of the first 10 well-child visits, shrinking the gap in attendance between families on Medicaid and those with commercial insurance. HealthySteps kids are also more likely to be up to date on their vaccines by age 2 compared to kids from similar backgrounds who weren't part of the program. Mothers report feeling more supported for breastfeeding, says Briggs, and they are more likely to discuss any depression symptoms and be connected to treatment. Children of mothers who reported childhood traumas scored higher on social-emotional screening after receiving support from HealthySteps compared to similar kids who didn't participate in the program. ""If every mom, every family had this opportunity, I really believe that depression will go down with the mothers and the family,"" says Cox-Bates, ""because most of us feel like we don't have anybody to turn to. We don't have that help."" She wishes HealthySteps was around when she was born. ""It would have probably benefited my mother,"" she says, and perhaps given her and her siblings a happier childhood.",11772,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/11/29/1215606941/parent-help-to-prevent-childhood-trauma,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point directs screen effect leave intergenerational social skill isaac significant specialist tool check healthier spark whisper forward difference allison dramatically back deal result income neglect john treatment appropriate turn minute experienced recently mom remembers history happier predictive shape violence affect braid kitchen time fiori decrease depression physical differently long big behavior provide call address move apartment emotional overwhelmed report discus literal meet score cognitive stress ear sibling probably secure issue pediatrician event energy rahil unperturbed succeed calmer reading forge found childhood endure philanthropic suffers lieber intervention teresa challenge university father chaos bead vaccine npr red attachment date skip strawberry upset extra feed hospital brought housing kholood believe brain calm enrol parent large model symptom connect worry albert strong early relationship screening disrupt director explains told tumaini research living educate commercial stressor give abuse financially child obesity foot experience brookdale spending attention regular background graduate cue nurture meal miss risk room pretty remember visit noise obvious tantrum positive cope tantruming professor play circumstance illness angry eat barely snuck pediatrics psychological hide prevent compare group appointment gap body chronic heart snap sister support alcoholism caregiver run strategy host ava profound environment shrink program vicious press fill pediatric computer kiddos health american adult setup trauma montefiore rise center make sign laptop year occasionally feel alternative safety eid stable fear researcher insurance part sectional include alter wish definitely food battle instability development responsive hardship beat landmark pull bond due especially healthysteps meltdown home system today game infant bates find navigate delay start vulnerable reflect mitigate family developmentally sexual invest love impact psychiatry catch determinant mental cultivate medical gently knew attendance kevin harsh set einstein safe learn feeling stability talk office fall free unusually month brooklyn receive left suicide coker high husband happiness ace easily adverse compassionate developmental attempt stressful reminder promising phone attend connection recognition country funding similar school range hospitalization function hard place kind playground happy struggle offer washington national work age medicaid tv step life add incredibly identify period hug conversation communication engross afternoon felt kid poverty healthy clinic born recall hunger medicine young friend eli reach foundation clothes boy clamor paralegal opportunity clean financial stay language low interaction daughter show video ordinary accomplish benefit practical abc inequity lot develop caption problem mother grow cycle disease briggs recent key college increase sleep day study rucker manage breastfeeding psychosocial journaling participate,0.97455,0.127420998980632,8.850933215391422,0.4874138856594998,0,2023-11-29
Washington Post,New CDC life expectancy data shows painfully slow rebound from covid,2023-11-29 00:05:00,"Joel Achenbach, Dan Keating","Newly published data on life expectancy in the United States shows a partial rebound from the worst phase of the coronavirus pandemic, but drug overdoses, homicides and chronic illnesses such as heart disease continue to drive a long-term mortality crisis that has made this country an outlier in longevity among wealthy nations.Life expectancy in 2022 rose more than a full year, to 77.5 years, in data released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than four-fifths of this positive jump was attributable to a drop in covid-19 deaths.But the rebound in 2022, which the CDC had anticipated after studying death rates, regained less than half the years lost to the pandemic, the federal health agency reported.“The amount of recovery is not as much as we’d like to see,” Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, said after reviewing the report.He said many peer countries suffered smaller drops in life expectancy and rebounded more quickly from covid-19’s impact.“It’s disturbing but not surprising to me that we have not experienced the recovery that other countries have,” Woolf said.In 2019, U.S. life expectancy at birth stood at 78.8 years. That figure cratered to 76.4 in 2021, the lowest since 1996. That was due partly to the extraordinary wave of covid deaths in January and February of that year as the United States had only begun to roll out vaccines. The following winter saw another short but intense wave of deaths as the omicron variant of the virus reached the country, creating the last major surge in pandemic deaths.“There appears to have been some recovery from covid, but we still have a way to go,” said William Schaffner, an infectious-disease physician at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.“Covid remains with us and continues to put people in the hospital, and have a substantial mortality rate associated with it, particularly among older people and people who are immunocompromised,” Schaffner said.The rise in certain chronic diseases in the United States — and slower progress in combating others — put the nation in a vulnerable position when the novel virus arrived. A scattered and politically polarized response to the pandemic played a role in the dire death toll that followed, as did resistance to vaccination and other public health measures. No other wealthy country experienced so high a rate of death per capita from covid.The new numbers are clearly positive — compared with 2021. But the same data show the dramatic, and protracted, impact of the pandemic. Between 2019 and 2021, life expectancy dropped 2.4 years, and the 2022 jump restored only 1.1. years of that deficit. (Men lost 2.8 years in those first two years, and women 2.1 years.)The United States has dug itself into a huge life-expectancy hole, and not just because of the virus that slipped into the country in stealth fashion in 2020. In articles this year, The Washington Post has explored the many reasons this country lags peer nations in life expectancy, and a major finding is that chronic conditions such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes and cancer play an underappreciated role in suppressing life spans.The new report affirms that conclusion. Although the coming and going of covid explains much of the shape of the mortality curve during the past several years, the CDC death data from the past decade and a half shows an ominous long-term trend in mortality that is not solely due to the coronavirus or other high-profile killers, including drug overdoses and gun homicides.Life expectancy rose in a relatively steady fashion for all of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. But starting in 2010, the country entered a decade of stagnation in this key metric. Drug overdoses, homicides and suicides played major roles in flattening the life expectancy curve. But the greatest erosion in life spans comes from chronic illnesses, The Post found in its analysis of death data.Life expectancy peaked at 78.9 in 2014, and then dipped or remained flat through 2019. The new CDC data, despite showing an improvement in 2022, suggests that this period of disappointing life expectancy will continue.“The pattern is consistent with the stagnation that we’ve seen since 2010,” said Elizabeth Arias, a demographer with the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics and lead author of the new report.“Even without the pandemic, life expectancy was flat or declining,” Arias said. “This is a whole new territory that we’re in, beginning a decade ago.”Very few countries have yet published life expectancy data for 2022, as reflected in records at the international human mortality database. The few that have, however, all show quicker recovery from the pandemic.Sweden in 2022 was back to the same life expectancy as before covid, 83.1 years, more than 5½ years longer than in the United States.In 2022, Belgium, Denmark and Norway had just slightly lower life expectancy than before the pandemic.Among countries reporting data for 2022, Finland comes closest to the profile of the United States in terms of recovery from the devastation wrought by the pandemic. In Finland, life expectancy was down 0.6 years compared with 2019. But that loss is less than half of the U.S. decrease of 1.3 years since 2019.Life expectancy at birth is not a prediction for any individual, but a statistical artifact, one that aggregates death rates from many different age cohorts and creates a handy, if potentially confusing, measure of a nation’s overall health.Schaffner, the Vanderbilt doctor, said the lingering effects of the pandemic and other health challenges provide a reminder that the United States needs to continue its comprehensive childhood vaccination program, which typically requires children to be immunized before attending school.“And now we have a slow erosion of that, with increasing vaccine skepticism and more and more parents withholding their children from comprehensive vaccination,” Schaffner said. “We don’t want to erode these very successful preventive health initiatives.”The new CDC report, which is considered “provisional” in advance of a final report due in December, captures the racial and ethnic disparities in life expectancy that were exacerbated by the pandemic.",6320,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/29/life-expectancy-2022-united-states/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,peer suffer potentially international deficit expectancy linger provisional typically hole wrought effect resistance program post nation data ethnic wealthy curve caput pandemic loss belgium health toll united final review role december make rise center dug exacerbate great year arrive disparity roll back longevity explore analysis william include small diabetes aria dire quickly experienced metric politically rate ominous jump shape huge remain reason overdoses norway woman relatively decrease gun due erode partly disturb drive enter find prevention start coronavirus vulnerable reflect provide continue handy protract agency erosion birth newly release anticipate author report impact associate preventive society lose successful past withholding profile extraordinary particularly slow finland killer drop measure steady found conclusion childhood crisis peaked rebound statistic wednesday full challenge substantial record number university attributable affirms fashion quicker longer vaccine doctor stagnation schaffner disappoint suicide high racial played combat hospital commonwealth reminder restore aggregate attend pattern reporting homicide country mortality suppress parent school prediction state remains demographer database vanderbilt require stealth begin closest washington national age comprehensive lag life span virginia february figure variant outlier wave director explains period flatten steven despite cdc solely emeritus slightly put omicron death child obesity suggests trend immunocompromised phase reach cratered denmark cohort immunize elizabeth flat intense consider underappreciated half surge improvement creates amount major publish public positive low lead confuse decline january consistent show different follow cancer illness play decade vaccination term progress short control slip disease physician territory statistical polarize scatter advance compare capture individual century woolf partial recovery response chronic key heart virus covid position federal dipped surprising dramatic increase human study create stood condition devastation article artifact winter regain skepticism,-0.97635,0.2373417721518987,10.871657940663171,0.4404826349486543,0,2023-11-29
CNN,"Users of diabetes drug Mounjaro lost more weight than those on Ozempic, large study finds",2023-11-28 22:39:00,Brenda Goodman,"Overweight and obese adults who took the injected medication Mounjaro lost more weight and were more likely to meet specific weight loss targets than people on a similar competitor, Ozempic, according to a new study of people taking the drugs in the real world.Both Ozempic, or semaglutide, and Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, mimic the effects of the gut hormone GLP-1, which stimulates the body’s production of insulin and slows the passage of food through the stomach. GLP-1 also signals the brain to help control appetite. Tirzepatide also stimulates a second gut hormone, called GIP, which may help boost its effects.The drugs are prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes but have gained new popularity because they may also help people lose substantial amounts of weight.The new study is a preprint that has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal. Its results are in line with observations from clinical trials, and many doctors had suspected that tirzepatide might be more potent after seeing the results in their diabetes patients. But so far, there haven’t been many studies that have compared the drugs head-to-head, especially in people who don’t have diabetes. One such investigation is underway, but results aren’t expected for more than a year.“Over 70% of American adults have overweight or obesity, and so there’s this huge potential for these medications to be used and [there’s] really a lack of information,” said lead study author Dr. Patricia Rodriguez, a senior applied scientist at Truveta Research.The study wasn’t sponsored by either of the drugs’ manufacturers. Instead, it was initiated by Truveta, a data analytics company owned and operated by 30 US health care systems. Truveta combines anonymous patient records from these hospitals and uses them to answer research questions.Because of their weight-loss benefits, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved higher doses of both tirzepatide and semaglutide for weight loss under the names Zepbound and Wegovy, respectively. The new study looked only at the doses approved to treat type 2 diabetes, which may limit its conclusions. The records spanned the period between May 2022 and September 2023.Rodriguez and her team combed through thousands of patient records to find overweight and obese adults on Mounjaro or Ozempic.Of the more than 18,000 people included in the study, just over half – 52% – had type 2 diabetes. The other 48% had no history of diabetes documented in their medical records, so researchers reasoned that this group of more than 9,000 people was probably taking the medications off-label at their doctor’s discretion, solely for weight loss.People lost more weight the longer they stayed on the medication, but many did not continue taking these drugs. Roughly half of people included in the study discontinued them during the study period.The authors note that it’s hard to say why people stopped filling their prescriptions. Both medications in the study were in shortage, and so they may have been difficult to find.The most common side effects noted in the medical records were nausea and vomiting, which were reported for about 1 in 5 people on the medications. Gallstones were reported for roughly 1 in 6. The study authors note that side effects were very similar between the medications, and they found no significant differences in the rates of any adverse eventPeople lost more weight on the medications if they didn’t have diabetes, but even if they did, those taking Mounjaro lost a greater percentage of their starting weight than those taking Ozempic.At three months, the average weight loss was about 6% for Mounjaro users, compared with nearly 4% for those on Ozempic. After six months, the average weight loss on Mounjaro was 10%, compared with 6% on Ozempic. At 12 months, people had dropped an average 15% of their body weight on Mounjaro, compared with about 8% on Ozempic. After the researchers adjusted their data for potential sources of bias, those differences narrowed.The study’s results aren’t a big departure from results posted in clinical trials, so they aren’t terribly surprising, says Dr. Mopelola Adeyemo, who treats people with diabetes and obesity at the University of California at Los Angeles.Adeyemo says that ultimately, the best weight loss drug for an individual is going to be the one that works for them. She has patients who can’t tolerate one form of a GLP-1 medication like Ozempic or Mounjaro but can take a different one.“I think there’s going to be roles for both of them, definitely, because both have been shown to not only help with weight loss but also diabetes and another cardiovascular benefits, as well,” Adeyemo said.Novo Nordisk, the company that makes Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, said the study isn’t a fair comparison.“The doses of semaglutide evaluated in this analysis have not been investigated for chronic weight management, and there are no head-to-head trials that have reported which evaluate Wegovy and tirzepatide.” a spokesperson said in a statement.The company notes that semaglutide is taken at a higher dose when used for weight loss.“We agree completely,” Rodriguez said. “We expect that in the obesity labeled medications, we would expect that people would lose more weight because the dosages are quite higher.”Eli Lilly, the company that makes Mounjaro and Zepbound, said it doesn’t condone the off-label use of its medication. It’s urging patience while it works to get more information.“Our SURMOUNT-5 trial, which is a head-to-head trial comparing tirzepatide (Zepbound) and semaglutide (Wegovy) for the treatment of obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities, is expected to read out in 2025,” a spokesperson said in an email.",5766,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/health/mounjaro-ozempic-weight-loss-study/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bias lack company obese information effect post ozempic slows source data gip type fill administration popularity semaglutide loss significant journal health american adult role make real investigate discontinue great difference respectively observation manufacturer wegovy result researcher treatment analysis scientist include zepbound diabetes underway definitely food discretion rate ultimately management history team huge form urge reason inject california anonymous especially system mopelola spokesperson patricia find comorbidities start big accord continue apply rodriguez call lilly read side nausea author report appetite meet lose preprint medical tirzepatide mimic patience probably signal drop document gut stimulates nordisk patient departure found conclusion dose approve evaluate vomit note substantial record shortage university specific email month longer doctor expect instead high difficult adverse hospital terribly limit stop passage brain similar hormone combed hard clinical suspect target weight mounjaro tolerate work potential percentage initiate span analytics operate fair investigation stomach period research competitor roughly condone solely agree adeyemo label production boost obesity eli overweight half amount publish lead answer gallstone eventpeople sponsor show common different user benefit average prescription prescribed senior potent control treat combine truveta stayed completely line insulin compare trial group individual thousand body september chronic cardiovascular adjust professional surprising study dosage medication,0.6819,0.0,10.38276056338028,0.4878833107191315,0,2023-11-28
CNN,"Large retailers such as Publix, Walmart, Aldi received recalled stone fruit, FDA warns",2023-11-28 21:41:00,Katherine Dillinger,"Peaches, plums and nectarines that have been recalled due to contamination concerns went to major retailers across the country, the US Food and Drug Administration warned Tuesday.The stone fruit has been linked with a Listeria outbreak that has caused at least 11 illnesses in seven states, with 10 hospitalizations and one death, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which most recently updated its data on November 21. One pregnant person who became ill went into early labor.The nonorganic fruit was sold individually and in bags between May 1 and November 15 last year and this year, the agency said. Publix, Walmart, Sam’s Club, Sprouts Farmers Market and some Albertsons and Aldi stores received the recalled products.However, the FDA notes that the fruit also went to companies that may have frozen or relabeled it.Anyone who has frozen peaches, plums or nectarines should throw them away if the products are or may be part of the recall. Fresh whole peaches, plums and nectarines that are currently on store shelves are not involved in the recall.Listeria infection usually starts about two weeks after someone eats contaminated food. It’s more likely to cause severe illness in people who are pregnant, who have weakened immune systems or who are 65 or older. Get medical care if you have symptoms of a Listeria infection such as fever, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance or seizures.The FDA and the CDC are also investigating an ongoing salmonella outbreak linked with recalled cantaloupe products that’s caused at least 99 illnesses and two deaths in 32 states.",1636,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/health/large-retailers-recalled-stone-fruit-fda-warning/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,weaken company receive retailer data administration loss fresh fatigue fruit farmer ongoing currently center away investigate country year hospitalization state contaminate symptom part person nonorganic early severe food recently pregnant fda albertsons recall contamination cdc due update death infection link system shelf neck confusion prevention balance fever cantaloupe start accord involve listeria major publix eats agency product peach ache nectarine individually frozen november muscle store sell illness outbreak medical throw control disease week headache club concern immune sprout stone sam aldi bag relabeled warn walmart salmonella note plum market stiff,-0.9549,0.0,10.854594594594593,0.4352272727272728,0,2023-11-28
CNN,How concerning is the spike in respiratory illnesses in China? A doctor explains,2023-11-28 15:13:00,Deblina Chakraborty,"Hospitals in northern China and Beijing have reported a surge in the number of children with respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia. Last week, the World Health Organization asked China to provide more information on the cases.Based on what is known thus far, how concerning are these cases? Why might there be a surge in respiratory illnesses? Should people traveling to China rethink their plans? What additional precautions should governments, health systems and individuals take?To help us understand the situation, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.CNN: How concerning is the spike in respiratory illnesses being reported in China?Dr. Leana Wen: Thus far, based on what we know from WHO, I don’t think the spike in respiratory illnesses should cause global concern. What would be most worrisome to the international medical community is if a new pathogen is emerging, as it did in the form of Covid-19 in the winter of 2019. This does not appear to be the case now.After WHO requested additional information from Chinese health authorities, it received data that indicates the increases in outpatient visits and hospital visits can be attributed to a rise in known, existing pathogens. Specifically, there has been an increase in pneumonia due to the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae since May, and a rise in influenza, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) since October. The spikes are “not unexpected given the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries,” according to WHO.Importantly, no new pathogen has been detected. There has also been no unusual clinical presentation with children appearing much sicker than normal.CNN: Why would China be seeing such a surge now?Wen: It’s certainly crucial for WHO and other members of the international medical community to independently verify these data points, especially given Chinese authorities’ delay in alerting the global community about Covid-19. However, the situation in China actually mirrors what happened in the United States and many other countries last year.Last winter, in 2022, children’s hospitals in the US were inundated with kids who were sick with Covid-19, flu, RSV and other common viruses. Much of this illness was attributed to the end of Covid-19 mitigation measures.During the peak of the pandemic, respiratory illnesses declined sharply. In particular, kids who otherwise would have gotten exposed to several infections a year didn’t get sick. When mitigation measures were lifted, contagious illnesses tore through schools and daycares, leading to a surge in infections among children and thus also an increase in those who required hospitalization.China lifted its mitigation measures later than the US and most other countries. It makes sense that, in the first full winter since ending “zero Covid,” they would experience a rise in respiratory illnesses like that which much of the world experienced.CNN: Chinese health authorities are attributing the rise in pediatric pneumonia cases to Mycoplasma pneumoniae — what is that?Wen: Pneumonia is a lung infection that can be caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common type of bacterial pneumonia. Some estimate that around 1% of the population in the US is infected with Mycoplasma every year. Only 5% to 10% of those infected with Mycoplasma will develop pneumonia.Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma is called an “atypical” pneumonia. The disease onset is often gradual, with patients experiencing nonspecific symptoms like low-grade fever, tiredness and headache. Some people report a nagging cough or chest soreness from coughing. Sore throat, runny nose and ear pain are possible, too, and in rare cases, individuals could develop a rash, joint pain and gastrointestinal symptoms.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections are most common in young adults and school-age children. People living and working in crowded settings (like schools) are at increased risk.Most patients with this kind of pneumonia do not need to be hospitalized and will improve with outpatient antibiotic treatment. Those most vulnerable to severe illness are the very young, elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and people with severe underlying medical conditions.CNN: Could the pneumonia cases be caused by other organisms too?Wen: Yes. The bacteria Streptococcus is another common cause of pneumonia. RSV and Covid-19 are among the types of viruses that can cause pneumonia, too. Many health care facilities will attempt to diagnose the source of the pneumonia and determine whether it’s bacterial or viral. However, the diagnostic capabilities in some areas may be more limited. Also, a single person may have multiple infections at once, and it’s not always easy to attribute the manifestation of pneumonia to one organism.CNN: Should people avoid travel to China at this point?Wen: WHO has said explicitly that it advises against “the application of any travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event.” It also does not recommend any specific preventive measures for travelers to China, though it does advise people in China to take steps to reduce the spread of respiratory illness. That includes staying home when ill, ensuring good ventilation, practicing regular handwashing and “wearing masks as appropriate.”I think these are all reasonable and would also add that people vulnerable to severe illness from respiratory diseases should take additional precautions, including wearing an N95 or equivalent mask while in indoor, crowded places.CNN: What additional precautions should governments and health systems take, especially those in the rest of China and neighboring countries?Wen: I agree with WHO that limiting travel or trade would not be reasonable at this time, though of course WHO should continue to press China for up-to-date and accurate data disclosures.In the meantime, governments and hospitals can bolster their own infrastructure. They should be on the lookout for a rise in influenza-like illnesses and pneumonia cases and test promptly.They should also ensure that they have the capacity to treat patients who need hospital care. It’s very possible that other areas, especially those with previously strict virus mitigation measures, will see a rise in respiratory illnesses this winter. Health systems need to prepare for a potential influx of patients, as they did during the peak of Covid-19.",6744,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/health/china-respiratory-illness-surge-wellness/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,point international improve information spread source press data pediatric type emergency soreness accurate possible independently pandemic bolster baltimore cough health united adult chest chinese rise outpatient make center year tore unexpected diagnostic infect treatment antibiotic gastrointestinal include daycare expose viral reduce severe experienced strict expert government management request spoke serve form time nose lookout due especially george mycoplasma home system joint course plan estimate crowd crucial cnn rare similarly prevention sicker delay mitigation vulnerable accord provide continue streptococcus ensure call community institute previously rest report preventive rethink hospitalize easy current additional flu available medical october ear organization facility diagnose china tiredness single pneumoniae advise reasonable organism pain measure patient happen underlie influenza milken full peak number university leana traveler specific population receive adenovirus handwash presentation manifestation emerge capability elderly recommend hospital explicitly attempt practice limit spike throat policy country school limited state require mirror clinical rash equivalent symptom determine understand kind global specifically northern person indicates washington work potential infrastructure base step wear add lift dr travel prepare gradual influx kid living detect attribute bacterial unusual fungi nag agree young give infection child sore experience respiratory immunocompromised worrisome regular wen ventilation lung contagious exist sick fever zero indoor test pneumonia onset surge nonspecific capacity world visit stay public lead pathogen alert authority decline application common member runny meantime professor beijing syncytial precaution setting illness restriction develop mask case avoid control treat disease week headache physician verify neighbor concern inundate particular multiple individual bacteria advises virus rsv covid area increase trade wellness situation atypical winter sharply,-0.90925,0.0444839857651245,11.833553859202713,0.4484955083230944,0,2023-11-28
NPR,"'If you have a face, you have a place in the conversation about AI,' expert says",2023-11-28 13:21:00,Tonya Mosley,"""You've likely heard of the 'male gaze' or the 'white gaze,'"" she explains. ""This is a cousin concept really, about who has the power to shape technology and whose preferences and priorities are baked in — as well as also, sometimes, whose prejudices are baked in."" Buolamwini notes that in a recent test of Stable Diffusion's text-to-image generative AI system, prompts for high paying jobs overwhelmingly yielded images of men with lighter skin. Meanwhile, prompts for criminal stereotypes, such as drug dealers, terrorists or inmates, typically resulted in images of men with darker skin. In her new book, Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What Is Human in a World of Machines, Buolamwini looks at the social implications of the technology and warns that biases in facial analysis systems could harm millions of people — especially if they reinforce existing stereotypes. ""With the adoption of AI systems, at first I thought we were looking at a mirror, but now I believe we're looking into a kaleidoscope of distortion,"" Buolamwini says. ""Because the technologies we believe to be bringing us into the future are actually taking us back from the progress already made."" Buolamwini says she got into computer science because she wanted to ""build cool future tech"" — not to be an activist. But as the potential misuses of the technology became clearer, she realized she needed to speak out. ""I truly believe if you have a face, you have a place in the conversation about AI,"" she says. ""As you encounter AI systems, whether it's in your workplace, maybe it's in the hospital, maybe it's at school, [ask] questions: 'Why have we adopted this system? Does it actually do what we think it's going to do?' "" On why facial recognition software makes mistakes How is it that someone can be misidentified by a machine? So we have to look at the ways in which we teach machines to recognize the pattern of a face. And so the approach to this type of pattern recognition is often machine learning. And when we talk about machine learning, we're talking about training AI systems that learn from a set of data. So you have a dataset that would contain many examples of a human face, and from that dataset, using various techniques, the model would be trained to detect the pattern of a face, and then you can go further and say, ""OK, let's train the model to find a specific face."" What my research showed and what others have shown as well is many of these datasets were not representative of the world at all. I started calling them ""pale male"" datasets, because I would look into the data sets and I would go through and count: How many light-skinned people, How many dark-skinned people? How many women, how many men and so forth. And some of the really important data sets in our field. They could be 70% men, over 80% lighter skinned individuals. And these sorts of datasets could be considered gold standards. ... And so it's not then so surprising that you would have higher misidentification rates for people who are less represented when these types of systems were being developed in the first place. And so when you look at people like Porcha Woodruff, who was falsely arrested due to facial recognition misidentification, when you look at Robert Williams, who was falsely arrested due to facial misidentification in front of his two young daughters, when you look at Nijeer Parks, when you look at Randall Reed, Randall was arrested for a crime that occurred in a state he had never even set foot in. And all of these people I've mentioned – they're all dark-skinned individuals. On why AI misgenders female faces Joy Buolamwini is the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization that raises awareness about the implications of AI. Her research was also featured in the Netflix documentary Coded Bias. Naima Green/Penguin Random House hide caption Joy Buolamwini is the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization that raises awareness about the implications of AI. Her research was also featured in the Netflix documentary Coded Bias. I looked at the research on gender classification, I saw with some prior studies, actually older women tended to be misgendered more often than younger women. And I also started looking at the composition of the various gender classification testing datasets, the benchmarks and so forth. And it's a similar kind of story to the dark skin here. It's not just the proportion of representation, but what type of woman is represented. So, for example, many of these face datasets are face datasets of celebrities. And if you look at women who tend to be celebrated, [they are] lighter skin women, but also [women who] fit very specific gender norms or gender presentation norms and stereotypes as well. And so if you have systems that are trained on some type of ideal form of woman that doesn't actually fit many ways of being a woman, this learned gender presentation does not reflect the world. On being a ""poet of code,"" and the success of her piece, ""AI, Aint I a Woman?"" I spent so much time wanting to have my research be taken seriously. ... I was concerned people might also think it's a gimmick. ... And so after I published the Gender Shades paper and it was really well received in the academic world and also industry, in some ways I felt that gave me a little bit of a shield to experiment with more of the poetic side. And so shortly after that research came out, I did a poem called ""AI, Ain't I a Woman?,"" which is both a poem and an AI audit from testing different AI systems out. And so the AI audit results are what drive the lyrics of the poems. And as I was working on that, it allowed me to connect with the work in a different way. This is where the humanizing piece comes in. So it's one thing to say, ""OK, this system is more accurate than that system,"" or ""this system performs better on darker skin or performs better on lighter skin."" And you can see the numbers. But I wanted to go from the performance metrics to the performance arts so you could feel what it's like if somebody is misclassified — not just read the various metrics around it. And so that's what the whole experimentation around ""AI, Ain't I a Woman?"" was. And that work traveled in places I didn't expect. Probably the most unexpected place was with the EU Global Tech panel. It was shown to defense ministers of every EU country ahead of a conversation on lethal autonomous weapons to humanize the stakes and think about what we're putting out. On her urgent message for President Biden about AI We have an opportunity to lead on preventing AI harms, and the subtitle of the book is protecting What Is Human in a World of Machines. And when I think of what is human, I think about our right to express ourselves, the essence of who we are and our expectations of dignity. I challenge President Biden for the U.S. to lead on what I call biometric rights. ... I'm talking about our essence, our actual likeness. ... Someone can take the voice of your loved one, clone it and use it in a hoax. So you might hear someone screaming for your name, saying someone has taken something, and you have fraudsters who are using these voice clones to extort people. Celebrity won't save you. You had Tom Hanks, his likeness was being used with synthetic media with a deepfake to promote a product he had never even heard of. So we see these algorithms of exploitation that are taking our actual essence. And then we also see the need for civil rights and human rights continue. It was very encouraging to see in the executive order that the principles from the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights — such as protections from algorithmic discrimination, that the AI systems being used are effective, that there are human fallbacks — were actually included, because that's going to be necessary to safeguard our civil rights and our human rights. On how catastrophizing about AI killing us in the future neglects the harm it can do now I'm concerned with the way in which AI systems can kill us slowly already. I'm also concerned with things like lethal autonomous weapons as well. So for me, you don't need to have super intelligent AI systems or advanced robotics to have a real harm. A self-driving car that doesn't see you on the road can be fatal and harmful. I think of this notion of structural violence where we think of acute violence: There's the gun, the bullet, the bomb. We see that type of violence. But what's the violence of not having access to adequate health care? What's the violence of not having housing and an environment free of pollution? And so when I think about the ways in which AI systems are used to determine who has access to health care and insurance, who gets a particular organ, in my mind ... there are already many ways in which the integration of AI systems lead to real and immediate harms. We don't have to have super-intelligent beings for that. Sam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

CNN,"Most school shootings aren’t mass killings, study finds, and they’re often driven by community violence",2023-11-27 11:04:00,Amanda Musa,"Many Americans think of school shootings as mass casualty events involving an adolescent with an assault-style weapon. But a new study says that most recent school shootings orchestrated by teenagers do not fit that image — and they are often related to community violence.The study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed 253 school shootings carried out by 262 adolescents in the US between 1990 and 2016.It found that these adolescents were responsible for only a handful of mass casualty shootings, defined as those involving four or more gunshot fatalities. About half of the shootings analyzed — 119 — involved at least one death. Among the events, seven killed four or more people.A majority of the shootings analyzed also involved handguns rather than assault rifles or shotguns, and they were often the result of “interpersonal disputes,” according to the researchers from University of South Carolina and University of Florida.“When you look at gun violence across the country, a big subset of that is suicide and community violence, which is largely committed by the use of handguns, not assault rifles and so on,” said Dr. Chethan Sathya, a pediatric surgeon and trauma director at Cohen Children’s Medical Center and director of the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at Northwell Health.Sathya, who was not involved in the new study, says it is important to highlight the difference between a mass shooting at a school and a school shooting brought on by community violence because the perpetrators often look different and are committing these acts of violence for different reasons. Therefore, the respective solutions look very different, as well.“You’re going to have the classic, very tragic mass shootings where someone comes in with a manifesto, and they want to kill the maximum number of people,” he said. “You’re also going to have gang-related violence, shootings that happen at school but have to do more with interpersonal violence and other drivers of community violence that are actually different than things that might drive these stereotypical mass shootings.”Researchers analyzed data from the American School Shooting Study, which compiles information about these shooting events from open-source materials.An overwhelming majority of the 262 adolescent shooters were male, with an average age of 16. But unlike many of the school shootings that make headlines, Sathya said, nearly 60% of the shooters in the study were Black.About 28% were White, and 8% were Latino. Another 5.7% represented other racial or ethnic groups, including Asian or Pacific Islander and indigenous peoples of the Americas.More than half of the shooters got the firearm they used from a family member or a relative. About 30% got a weapon from the illegal market, while 22% obtained weapons from friends or acquaintances.“Parents need to be responsible for the storage of those weapons, because they can often be used for shooting and for other types of violence,” Sathya said. “We know that from prior studies.”The researchers also looked at economic backgrounds. About 20% of these adolescents lived below the poverty line. About 12% of the households included in the data were characterized as headed by women. About 26% of residents of these households did not have high school diplomas, and 10% were unemployed.Investing in community violence intervention programs can help reduce this kind of violence in schools, according to Sathya.“Policies that build up infrastructure in at-risk communities to stop the cycle of violence” he said. “Those include things like green spaces, parks, employment opportunities, food security, other social determinants of health, economic mobility. Those are the kinds of things that get at-risk youth out of the cycle of violence, in addition to that community violence.”The researchers behind the new study also note that most of the firearms used in the shootings were lower- or moderately powered, meaning they will probably cause less severe damage than a higher-powered weapon.The use of lower- to moderately powered firearms in school shootings involving adolescents in the US has gone down, with the early 1990s marking the height of such firearm use. The rate at which adolescents use higher-powered firearms has been stable over time, with a modest increase since the mid-1990s.“Several factors could account for these findings: alterations in firearm manufacturing and availability, increasing adolescent interest in and familiarity with more potent weapons, or changes in documentation methods,” the researchers say adding that the number of shootings in which the firearm’s power was undisclosed in open sources increased during the study period.They also said there is a need for a standardized national reporting system, as many Americans depend on media sources to learn about school shootings.“Despite more extensive media coverage, the increase of online publications and social media in the 21st century has not necessarily deepened our understanding of firearms used in shootings,” the researchers wrote. “Future efforts must prioritize consistent reporting procedures, especially for infrequent but significant events, such as school shootings and other notable violent acts.”Sathya says there also needs to be more research into gun violence.“There’s been such a paucity of research in this space that, often, research studies like this add a lot to the field,” he said, adding that the only way to address an issue like gun violence is to figure out what drives it.“This is a public health issue, not a political one. It’s not really about gun ownership,” Sathya said. “It’s about ways to make our environment safer and guns safer. That’s the goal.”",5739,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/health/school-shootings-study/index.html,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,modest shooter information fatality environment image program source pediatric data type social ethnic islander illegal shoot casualty significant south journal health american manufacturing dispute trauma center make important difference act result green medium teenager stable researcher procedure represent include reduce political severe food power rate change handful shooting undisclosed violence respective reason time woman economic goal gun especially latino youth documentation system tragic drive mass extensive prevention highlight male big accord involve responsible security define family community address addition standardize field firearm familiarity determinant method medical resident asian probably sathya issue carolina event pacific monday height learn happen found indigenous write open intervention park note gunshot majority market space number university relative headline moderately characterize classic suicide high perpetrator racial alteration interest adolescent publication brought coverage stop future infrequent assault obtain reporting policy country solution ownership unlike household parent prior orchestrate school maximum effort chethan understand kind early employment prioritize related national age infrastructure finding add figure director mark research poverty damage surgeon depend rifle violent carry largely online despite manifesto necessarily death child live weapon friend factor background compiles safer build half opportunity mobility paucity publish public driver consistent head account member different meaning overwhelm average stereotypical kill lot commit cohen potent cycle interpersonal pediatrics white availability line analyze shotgun northwell group deepen century fit recent jama storage handgun increase subset study notable diploma,-0.9876,0.1568217459487715,11.184990328820115,0.4238499614081009,0,2023-11-27
CNN,‘Everybody in this community has a gun’: How Oakland lost its grip on gun violence,2023-11-27 06:29:00,not specified,"The red-tipped bullet pierces skin and melts into it, Javier Velasquez Lopez explains. The green-tipped bullet penetrates armored vests. And the hollow-tipped bullet expands as it tears through bodies.At 19, Velasquez Lopez knows a lot about ammunition because many of his friends own guns, he said. They carry to defend themselves in East Oakland, where metal bars protect shop windows and churches stand behind tall, chain-link fences.Some people even hide AR-15-style assault weapons down their pants legs, he said.“It doesn’t feel safe. Wherever you’re at, you’re always anxious,” said Velasquez Lopez, who dreams of leaving the city where he was born. “You’re always wondering what’s going to happen.”Last year, two gunmen in ski masks stormed his high school, killing a school district carpenter and injuring five other adults, including two students.Oakland won acclaim just a few years ago as a national model for gun violence prevention, in part by bringing police and community groups together to target the small number of people suspected of driving the gun violence.Then, in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic shut down schools, businesses, and critical social services nationwide, leaving many low-income people isolated and desperate — facing the loss of their jobs, homes, or both. The same year, police murdered George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, which released pent-up fury over racial discrimination by law enforcement, education, and other institutions — sparking nationwide protests and calls to cut police funding.In the midst of this racial reckoning and facing the threats of an unknown and deadly virus, Americans bought even more guns, forcing some cities, such as Raleigh, North Carolina; Chicago; New York City; and Oakland, to confront a new wave of violent crime.“There was emotional damage. There was physical damage,” said James Jackson, CEO of Alameda Health System, whose Wilma Chan Highland Hospital Campus, a regional trauma center in Oakland, treated 502 gunshot victims last year, compared with 283 in 2019. “And I think some of this violence that we’re seeing is a manifestation of the damage that people experienced.”Jackson is among a growing chorus of health experts who describe gun violence as a public health crisis that disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic residents in poor neighborhoods, the very people who disproportionately struggle with Type 2 diabetes and other preventable health conditions. Covid further eviscerated these communities, Jackson added.While the pandemic has retreated, gun violence has not. Oaklanders, many of whom take pride in the ethnic diversity of their city, are overwhelmingly upset about the rise in violent crime — the shootings, thefts, and other street crimes. At town halls, City Council meetings, and protests, a broad cross-section of residents say they no longer feel safe.Programs that worked a few years ago don’t seem to be making a dent now. City leaders are spending millions to hire more police officers and fund dozens of community initiatives, such as placing violence prevention teams at high schools to steer kids away from guns and crime.Yet gun ownership in America is at a historic high, even in California, which gun control advocates say has the strictest gun laws in the country. More than 1 million Californians bought a gun during the first year of the pandemic, according to the latest data from the state attorney general.As Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price told an audience at a September town hall in East Oakland: “We are in a unique, crazy time where everybody in this community has a gun.”Oakland’s flatlands southeast of downtown are the backdrop of most of the city’s shootings and murders.The area stands in stark contrast to the extreme wealth of the millionaire homes that dot the Oakland Hills and the immaculate, flower-lined streets of downtown. The city’s revived waterfront, named after famed author and local hero Jack London, draws tourists to trendy restaurants.On a Saturday night in August, Shawn Upshaw drove through the flatlands along International Boulevard, past the prostitutes who gather on nearly every corner for at least a mile, and into “hot spots,” where someone is shot nearly every weekend, he said.“When I grew up, women and kids would get a pass. They wouldn’t get caught in the crossfire,” said Upshaw, 52, who was born and raised in Oakland. “But now women and kids get it, too.”Upshaw works as a violence interrupter for the city’s Department of Violence Prevention, which coordinates with the police department and community organizations in a program called Ceasefire.When there’s a shooting, the police department alerts Upshaw on his phone and he heads to the scene. He doesn’t wear a police uniform. He’s a civilian in street clothes: jeans and a black zip-up jacket. It makes him more approachable, he said, and he’s not there to place blame, but rather to offer help and services to survivors and bystanders.The goal, he said, is to stop a retaliatory shooting by a rival gang or grieving family member.Police also use crime data to approach people with gang affiliations or long criminal records who are likely to use a gun in a crime — or be shot. Community groups follow up with offers of job training, education, meals, and more.“We tell them they’re on our radar and try to get them to recognize there are alternatives to street violence,” said Oakland Police Department Capt. Trevelyon Jones, head of Ceasefire. “We give them a safe way of backing out of a conflict while maintaining their street honor.”Every Thursday at police headquarters, officers convene a “shooting review.” They team up with representatives from community groups to make house calls to victims and their relatives.After the program launched in 2012, Oakland’s homicides plummeted and were down 39% in 2019, according to a report commissioned by the Oakland Police Department.Then covid hit.“You had primary care that became an issue. You had housing that became an issue. You had employment that became an issue,” said Maury Nation, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University. “It created a surplus of the people who fit that highest risk group, and that overwhelms something like Ceasefire.”With ever-rising housing prices in Oakland and across California, homeless encampments have multiplied on sidewalks and under freeway bypasses. The city is also bracing for the loss of jobs and civic pride as the Oakland Athletics baseball team plans to relocate after 2024, following departures by the NBA’s Golden State Warriors in 2019 and the NFL’s Raiders in 2020.“Housing, food insecurity, not having jobs that pay wages for folks, all can lead to violence and mental health issues,” said Sabrina Valadez-Rios, who works at the Freedom Community Clinic in Oakland and teaches a high school class for students who have experienced gun violence. Her father was fatally shot outside their Oakland home when she was a child. “We need to teach kids how to deal with trauma. Violence is not going to stop in Oakland.”Homicides in Oakland climbed to 123 people in 2021, police reports show, dipping slightly to 120 last year. Police have tallied 108 homicides as of Nov. 12 this year. Neither the police department nor the city provided statistics on how many of those killings involved firearms, despite repeated requests from KFF Health News.Experts also blame the rise in killings in Oakland and other American cities on the prevalence of gun ownership in the U.S., which has more guns than people. For all the pandemic disruption worldwide, homicide rates didn’t go up in countries with strict gun laws, said Thomas Abt, director of the Center for the Study and Practice of Violence Reduction at the University of Maryland.“We saw gun violence, homicides, shootings spike up all around the country. And interestingly, it did not happen internationally,” Abt said. “The pandemic did not lead to more violence in other nations.”Oakland residents are angry. One by one, business owners, community organizers, church leaders, and teenagers have stood at town halls and City Council meetings this year with an alarming message: They no longer feel safe anywhere in their city — at any time.“It’s not just a small number of people in the evening or nighttime. This is all hours, day and night,” said Noha Aboelata, founder of the Roots Community Health Center in Oakland. “Someone’s over here pushing a stroller and someone’s getting shot right next to them.”One morning in early April, automatic gunfire erupted outside a Roots clinic. Patients and staff members dropped to the ground and took cover. After the shooting stopped, medical assistants and a doctor gave first aid to a man in his 20s who had been shot six times.Everyone is blaming someone or something else for the bloodshed.Business owners have had enough. In September, Target announced it would close nine stores in four states, including in Oakland because of organized retail theft; the famed Vietnamese restaurant Le Cheval shut its doors after 38 years, partly blaming car break-ins and other criminal activity for depressing its business; and more than 200 business owners staged an hours-long strike to protest the rise in crime.The leadership of the local NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, made headlines this summer when it said Oakland was seeing a “heyday” for criminals, and pointed to the area’s “failed leadership” and “movement to defund the police.”“It feels like there’s a dark cloud over Oakland,” said Cynthia Adams, head of the local chapter, which has called on the city to hire 250 more police officers.Price, a progressive elected last year, already faces a recall effort, in part because she rejects blanket enhanced sentences for gangs and weapons charges, and has declined to charge youths as adults.The new mayor, Sheng Thao, was criticized for firing the police chief for misconduct and breaking a campaign promise to double funding at the city’s Department of Violence Prevention. In her first State of the City address last month, Thao described the surge in crime as “totally and completely unacceptable,” and acknowledged that Oaklanders are hurting and scared. She said the city has expanded police foot patrols and funded six new police academies, as well as boosted funding for violence prevention and affordable housing.“Not a day goes by where I don’t wish I could just wave a magic wand and silence the gunfire,” Thao said.Many in the community, including Valadez-Rios, advocate for broader investment in Oakland’s poorest neighborhoods over more law enforcement.City councils, states, and the federal government are putting their faith in violence prevention programs, in some cases bankrolling them from nontraditional sources, such as the state-federal Medicaid health insurance program for low-income people.Last month, California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom approved an 11% state tax on guns and ammunition, and $75 million of the revenue annually is expected to go to violence prevention programs.Although these programs are growing in popularity, it is unclear how successful they are. In some cases, proven programs that involve law enforcement, such as Ceasefire, were cut back or shelved after George Floyd was murdered, said Abt, the Maryland researcher.“The intense opposition to law enforcement means that the city was unwilling to use a portion of the tools that have been proven,” Abt said. “It’s good to work on preventing youth violence, but the vast majority of serious violence is perpetrated by adults.”Kentrell Killens, interim chief at the Oakland Department of Violence Prevention, acknowledges that young adults drive Oakland’s gun violence, not high school kids. But, he said, shootings on the streets affect children. Of the 171 homicides in 2019 and 2020, 4% of victims were 17 or under, while 59% were ages 18 to 34, according to the Oakland Police Department.The number of children injured in nonfatal shootings is also worrisome, he said. Roughly 6% of victims and 14% of suspects in nonfatal shootings were 17 or younger in 2019 and 2020.“We’ve seen the impact of violence on young people and how they have to make decisions around what roles they want to play,” said Killens, who spent a decade as a case manager working with schoolkids.By being in the schools, “we can deal with the conflicts” that could spill into the community, he added.At Fremont High School, Principal Nidya Baez has welcomed a three-person team to her campus to confront gun violence. One caseworker focuses on gun violence and another on sexual assaults and healthy relationships. The third is a social worker who connects students and their families to services.They are part of a $2 million city pilot program created after the Oakland School Board eliminated school-based police in 2020 — about one month after George Floyd was killed and after a nine-year push by community activists to kick police out of schools.“We’ve been at a lot of funerals, unfortunately, for gang-related stuff or targeting of kids, wrong-place-wrong-time kind of thing,” said Baez, whose father was shot and injured on his ice cream truck when she was a child.When Francisco “Cisco” Cisneros, a violence interrupter from the nonprofit group Communities United for Restorative Youth Justice, arrived at Fremont in January, students were wary, he said. Many still are. Students are hard-wired not to share information — not to be a “snitch” — or open up about themselves or their home life, especially to an adult, Cisneros said. And they don’t want to talk to fellow students from another network, group, or gang. “If we catch them at an early age, right now, we can change that mindset,” said Cisneros, who was born and raised in Oakland.Cisneros pulls from his past to build a rapport with students. This summer, for example, when he overheard a student chatting on the phone to an uncle in jail, Cisneros asked about him. It turns out Cisneros and the boy’s uncle had grown up in the same neighborhood.That was enough to begin a relationship between Cisneros and the student, “J,” who declined to be identified by his full name for fear of retribution. The 16-year-old credits Cisneros, whom he describes as “like a dad,” with keeping him engaged in school and employed with summer jobs — away from trouble. Still, he regularly worries about making a wrong move.“You could do one thing and you could end up in a situation where your life is at risk,” J said in Cisneros’ office. “You go from being in school one day to being in a very bad, sticky situation.”The program is underway in seven high schools, and Cisneros believes he has helped prevent a handful of conflicts from escalating into gun violence.After his school counselor was shot at Rudsdale High School in September 2022, Velasquez Lopez heard that the man and other victims were treated at nearby Highland Hospital.“Seeing him get hurt, he obviously needed medical attention,” Velasquez Lopez said. “That made it obvious I could help my community if I were to be a nurse to help people that live around my area.”When a recruiter from the Alameda Health System came to campus to promote a six-week internship at Highland Hospital, Velasquez Lopez applied. It was, he said, a dramatic step for a student who had never cared about school or sought vocational training.Over the summer, he volunteered in the emergency room, learned how to take a patient’s vitals, watched blood transfusions, and translated for Spanish-speaking patients.Velasquez Lopez, who graduated this year, is now looking for ways to get a nursing degree. The cost of college is out of reach at the moment, but he knows he doesn’t want to stay in a city where you can easily buy a gun for $1,000 — or half that, if it’s been used in a crime.Velasquez Lopez said he has bigger goals for himself.Young people in East Oakland “always feel like we’re trapped in that community, and we can’t get out,” he said. “But I feel like we still have a chance to change our lives.”This article was produced by KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

Fox News,"When measuring heart attack risk, one important red flag is often overlooked, doctors say",2023-11-27 04:15:00,Melissa Rudy,"Heart disease kills more people in the U.S. than any other cause of death — yet many Americans aren’t aware of one major genetic risk factor.Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a protein that can greatly increase the chances of a heart attack when it’s present in high levels in the blood.Fox News Digital spoke with Dr. Seth Baum, a cardiologist and chief scientific officer at Flourish Research in Boca Raton, Florida, about the importance of this often overlooked red flag.COLORADO CARDIAC NURSE, AFTER THREE HEART ATTACKS, OFFERS SURVIVAL TIPS: ‘LISTEN TO YOUR GUT’Along with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), Lp(a) carries cholesterol through the blood.The higher your levels of Lp(a), the more likely that cholesterol will build up in your blood vessels, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke.Heart disease kills more people in the U.S. than any other cause of death — killing one person every 33 seconds. (iStock)""Lp(A) contains a particle that leads to cardiovascular disease when it's in higher concentrations,"" Baum said.There are three main elements of Lp(A) that put people at risk, the cardiologist said.REDUCING SALT INTAKE BY JUST 1 TEASPOON A DAY HAS SAME EFFECT AS BLOOD PRESSURE MEDS, STUDY FINDSThe first is that it causes atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of fats and cholesterol in the arteries.""Another is that it causes inflammation, which is a really important aspect of plaque progression and the risk of creating a heart attack,"" Baum said.The third component, which is also vital in the genesis of a heart attack or a stroke, is that Lp(a) increases the risk of clotting, the doctor said — which could block off the artery.""We call it a triple threat,"" Baum said.Along with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), Lipoprotein(a) carries cholesterol through the blood. (iStock)Brett Sealove, M.D., chief of cardiology at Jersey Shore University Medical Center, agreed that Lp(a) is an indicator of a serious threat.""These ‘bad cholesterols’ result in plaque build-up in the arteries and reduced blood flow to vital organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys and legs,"" he told Fox News Digital.""The evidence is irrefutable — Lp(a) is considered an independent risk factor in addition to classic heart disease risk factors.""Approximately 20% of the population is at risk because of Lp(a).""These are very, very big numbers,"" Baum said. ""And it’s even higher than that in certain genetic groups.""STANDING AND EVEN SLEEPING ARE BETTER FOR YOUR HEART THAN SITTING, NEW STUDY SUGGESTSBlack and South Asian Americans are at particularly high risk.Despite that high prevalence, only a negligible share of Americans know their Lp(a) levels, the doctor pointed out.""Probably fewer than 1% of the population has had their Lp(a) levels checked,"" he estimated.The higher your levels of Lp(a), the more likely that cholesterol will build up in your blood vessels, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. (iStock)Dr. Bradley Serwer, a cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, a Cincinnati, Ohio-based company that offers cardiovascular and anesthesiology services to hospitals nationwide, noted that the cost and limited access to Lp(a) testing can be a problem.""When trying to assess heart health risk, we often use risk screening tools that estimate an individual's 10-year risk for developing significant cardiovascular disease,"" he told Fox News Digital.DOES THE FLU INCREASE THE RISK OF HEART ATTACKS?""These calculators take into consideration age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and smoking history — but they do not include Lp(a),"" he went on.""Since these nationally accepted tools do not include the lipoprotein(a) in their score calculation, some insurance companies do not cover the cost of the testing.""While LDL is genetically driven in a small subset of the population, Baum said, that type of lipoprotein is heavily influenced by diet and exercise.Lp(A), however, cannot be controlled by lifestyle factors.""There's no therapeutic currently available that will reduce Lp(a),"" Baum said.Lp(A) levels can be tested through a simple blood sample. (iStock)So why check the levels if there’s nothing that can be done?""Even though we can’t directly reduce Lp(a), we can reduce other cardiovascular risk factors,"" Baum said. ""You’ll still have the Lp(a) risk, but you won't have all the other stuff floating around — so you can mitigate some of the overall risk.""In Europe and Canada, the doctor noted, there are guidelines in place that state everyone should have universal screening for Lp(a) levels.WANT TO LIVE LONGER? FOLLOW 8 HEART-HEALTHY HABITS, SAYS THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION""In America, we’re a little behind the times — we still only check Lp(a) in patients who are at a higher risk,"" he said.Some doctors, like Baum, recommend testing Lp(a) levels for everyone, with the idea that if patients know they are more susceptible to heart attacks, they will be much more likely to reduce other cardiovascular risks.Lp(A) levels can be tested through a simple blood sample.At a minimum, Baum recommends getting Lp(a) levels checked at least once, and then again in the event of certain health changes.

CNN,Even more free home Covid-19 tests are available for order from the US government,2023-11-20 12:09:00,Amanda Musa,"US households are now eligible to order an additional four at-home Covid-19 tests — free of cost — through the government.As of Monday, residential households in the US can submit an order through Covidtests.gov for four individual rapid antigen Covid-19 tests. Orders will start to ship on November 27, according to USPS. People without an internet connection can call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489) to request tests.The US government had suspended the rapid test distribution program earlier in May, then reopened it in September. Residents who haven’t placed an order since the program reopened can place two orders, which will provide eight tests in total, according to USPS.Covid-19 rapid tests can be taken at home and can be used regardless of whether someone has symptoms. The tests should work through the end of the year; some of the dates on the tests may show that they are expired, but the US Food and Drug Administration has extended those dates.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people test if they have any Covid-19-like symptoms including a sore throat, runny nose, loss of smell or taste, or a fever. People may also want to test before they are going to be a part of a large event, like a concert or a conference, particularly if people are not up-to-date on their vaccines. Antivirals are available to treat Covid-19 and flu, and testing can help determine which medication is needed.Covid-19 hospital admissions and emergency department visits are once again on the rise after a few weeks of downturn, according to the CDC. For the week ending November 11, the percentage of Covid-related emergency department visits was 1.4%, or just over 16,200 people — similar to rates seen throughout this month and last month.Overall, outpatient visits for flu-like illness are lower than they were at this time last year but higher than in the previous four seasons. CDC forecasting suggests that this respiratory virus season will result in about the same number of hospitalizations as last season.Seasonal flu activity is also increasing in most parts of the country with flu-like activity labeled as high in New Mexico, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina, according to the CDC. There have been at least 780,000 illnesses, 8,000 hospitalizations, and 490 deaths from flu so far this season, the agency estimates.More than a third of adults and nearly a third of children have gotten their flu shot this year, CDC data shows. About 14% of adults and 5% of children have gotten the new Covid-19 vaccine while 14% of older adults ages 60 and up have gotten the new RSV vaccine.CNN’s Jen Christensen and Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.",2713,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/20/health/free-covid-tests-ordering/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230925113940-home-covid-test-file-040523.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,christensen percentage administration number result work admission order hospitalization disease place residential eligible smell hospital similar mcphillips recommends earlier antigen include suggests deidre start rsv runny test cost south label high accord child alabama submit mississippi treat september call antiviral rapid november activity forecasting request resident contribute vaccine respiratory free virus symptom particularly increase downturn fever week government tty determine age month florida jen event taste emergency year cdc extend food adult shot illness prevention throat date suspend nose carolina control distribution available program agency internet low monday usps reopen georgia expire country center household time part provide individual season connection data concert conference show department outpatient medication mexico rise death additional rate home visit loss previous large report flu sore total ship,-0.89585,0.0,10.7213849287169,0.3696216450216451,0,2023-11-20
