CNN,Details emerge about UNLV gunman who killed 3 faculty members as investigators search for his motive. Here’s what we know,2023-12-08 03:06:00,Elizabeth Wolfe,"Investigators searching for the motive of Anthony Polito, the gunman who killed 3 faculty members at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on Wednesday, have uncovered a “target list” that included faculty at the university and elsewhere, according to Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill.Polito, who was shot and killed by police, injured a fourth person during the shooting inside a UNLV business school building, authorities said. The victim, a visiting male professor, is being treated for life-threatening injuries, McMahill said Thursday.The 67-year-old Polito had written a “target list” that included “people he was seeking on the university campus as well as faculty from the Eastern Carolina University,” McMahill said Thursday, though he noted none of the faculty members shot Wednesday were on the list.McMahill did not explain what led investigators to believe it was a list of targets or where the document was found.It is still unclear why Polito, who lived in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, targeted UNLV or if he had any connection to the school. He had worked at schools in Georgia and North Carolina, his now-removed LinkedIn page showed, including as a business professor at Eastern Carolina University. And in recent years he worked as an adjunct instructor at Roseman University in Henderson until 2022, the school confirmed.Polito had unsuccessfully applied to several higher education jobs in Nevada and appeared to be struggling financially, McMahill said Thursday, noting an eviction notice was found on the door of his Henderson apartment.In the hours leading up to the shooting, Polito had mailed 22 letters to university personnel across the country with no return address, the sheriff said. At least some of the envelopes had a white powder in them, but the substance was found to be harmless, Las Vegas police said Thursday evening. Further details about the letters’ contents weren’t immediately released.Detectives are working with the postal inspector and federal personnel to process the letters, but are asking people who work in academia who receive a letter with no return address to “proceed with caution,” McMahill said.UNLV president Keith Whitfield described the shooting, which happened just days before the start of final exams, as “the most difficult day in the history of our university.”The shooting began shortly before noon on Wednesday inside the university’s Beam Hall, where professors had been preparing students for the tests to come. Outside, a gathering of students was enjoying games, food and other activities.Two of the people killed were business school professors Patricia Navarro-Velez and Cha-Jan “Jerry” Chang, the president said Thursday in a letter to the school community. The name of the third slain faculty member will be released after that person’s relatives are notified, he said.“I won’t sugarcoat it. We are all hurting right now,” Whitfield said. “But it’s in these trying times that we need to lean on one another for support.”In his letter to the university community, Whitfield acknowledged the shock many on campus are grappling with following the loss of several beloved faculty members.“Words are still hard to come by as we’re only beginning to process the grief, loss, anger, and fear associated with Wednesday’s tragic campus shooting that took the lives of three of our cherished faculty members,” Whitfield wrote.Navarro-Velez, an assistant professor of accounting, had been teaching at the school for almost five years and had “devoted her career to educating the next generation of accountants,” the president said.The second slain professor, Chang, had been teaching UNLV’s business school students for more than 20 years as a “longtime educator of management information systems,” Whitfield said.Navarro-Velez, 39, worked on the fourth floor of Beam Hall and Chang, 64, worked on the third floor, according to the sheriff.CNN’s Cheri Mossburg, Jillian Sykes, Andy Rose and Evan Perez contributed to this report.",3999,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/08/us/university-of-nevada-las-vegas-shooting-friday/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207041554-exp-christian-heyne-intvw-fst-120703aseg2-00000222.png?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police country slain return relative patricia uncovered teach enjoy described contribute hall financially happen campus content devote unlv caution address shortly system difficult struggle vega receive start assistant day kevin write lean tragic release inspector game hurt school mail cherished wednesday faculty instructor explain begin accounting accord information career live eastern harmless history mcmahill floor injured jerry student university north prepare polito carolina anger page grief test envelope search life perez year immediately shoot hard loss acknowledge shock follow beam member report found exam inside victim visit person associate male whitfield kill educator suburb adjunct henderson sugarcoat proceed educate keith professor recent hour gathering fear jillian believe work education beloved president motive unsuccessfully job mossburg chang building grapple lead fourth notify gunman powder seek food injury high academia note word process federal include document linkedin connection noon personnel georgia sheriff evan nevada roseman notice management thursday time detail postal final generation authority accountant shot target cheri show apply letter unclear eviction list treat investigator andy white anthony sykes business rise substance community longtime,-0.98715,0.450112528132033,10.987506849315064,0.3216859716859716,0
CNN,Azerbaijan and Armenia agree to prisoner swap and to work towards peace deal,2023-12-08 02:44:00,Angela Dewan,"Azerbaijan and Armenia have agreed to a prisoner exchange, and to work towards normalizing ties and a peace deal to a decades-long conflict — a move the United States and European Union have welcomed.Azerbaijan will release 32 prisoners of war to Armenia in exchange for two, all members of the military, according to a joint statement published by Azerbaijan’s state news agency AZERTAC.“The Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan share the view that there is a historical chance to achieve a long-awaited peace in the region. Two countries reconfirm their intention to normalize relations and to reach the peace treaty on the basis of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the statement reads. The breakthrough comes after talks between the offices of the Azerbaijani president and the Armenian prime minister.“An agreement has been reached on taking tangible steps towards building confidence between two countries,” the statement reads.A US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the prisoner swap represented “an important confidence building measure” as the two countries work towards a peace agreement.“We commend Azerbaijani President (Ilham) Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister (Nikol) Pashinyan for their joint efforts to lay the groundwork for a more peaceful and prosperous future for the people of the South Caucasus,” Miller said in a statement. “The United States will continue to strongly support efforts to reach a durable and dignified peace.”“Establishing and deepening bilateral dialogue between sides has been a key objective of the EU-led Brussels process: today’s progress is a key step,” EU Council President Charles Michel said on X. “I now encourage the leaders to finalise the … peace deal ASAP.”The neighboring nations have been engaged in a decades long conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in the Caucasus Mountains.In September, Azerbaijan regained control of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic-Armenian enclave within its borders, after launching a lightning 24-hour assault.Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally considered part of Azerbaijan but for decades has been under the control of Armenian separatists. Armenia and Azerbaijan had already fought two wars over Nagorno-Karabakh since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and ceasefire agreements between them have proven brittle.Armenia earlier this year conceded that the region was part of Azerbaijan, but there are still divisions over the future of its government.The latest breakthrough on prisoner exchanges and normalizing ties came as delegates from both countries also attend the COP28 climate talks in Dubai.The statement also said that Armenia would pull out of the running to host the annual UN-backed climate summit next year and that it hoped other countries would support Azerbaijan’s candidacy.There is a vacuum for the summit host for COP29 in 2024, which should be held in eastern Europe, as UN rules dictate. The two nations had before Thursday been blocking each other’s candidacy in the voting process.The host country is decided by vote among nations within the region for the year. Russia has voted against several nations that are members of or allied to the European Union.Azerbaijan, which has been forging closer ties with Russia, is a major oil and gas producer.

CNN,Italy quits Belt and Road plan as Europe rethinks China relations,2023-12-08 02:38:00,Simone McCarthy,"Italy, the only G7 country to join China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative, will leave the global infrastructure program when its contract expires next year - the latest sign of hardening European attitudes to Beijing and its global ambitions.Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday confirmed the widely expected move, a campaign pledge during her run for office last year amid complaints the deal signed with China by a previous government in 2019 had brought few benefits to Italy’s economy.Meloni stressed however that Rome could maintain good ties with Beijing outside the program, which has expanded China’s global influence while raising concerns it has saddled some countries with unmanageable debt.“I think that we should … improve our cooperation with China on trade, the economy,” Meloni told reporters, according to Reuters, in her first public comments on the issue after reports Italy had told China of its decision not to extend the pact after it expires in March 2024.“The tool of the (BRI) … has not produced the results that were expected,” she added.Italy’s move comes as the European Union has embarked on a campaign to “de-risk” its supply chains from China’s and secure sensitive technologies after the bloc deemed Beijing a “systemic rival” in 2019.Those frictions were on show Thursday during a summit between EU heads and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, where the two sides grappled with points of contention from trade to Russia’s war in Ukraine - with little concrete progress made.China’s Foreign Ministry took a measured tone when asked about the Italian withdrawal during a regular press briefing Thursday, pointing to the “enormous appeal and global influence of Belt and Road cooperation.”“China firmly opposes attempts to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation or stoke bloc confrontation and division,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, without referring directly to Italy.China has inked agreements with what it says are more than 140 countries for partnership on the program, which has funneled hundreds of billions of dollars into roads, ports, airports and bridges, largely across the Global South over the past decade.Italy’s decision to join the scheme in 2019 was widely seen at the time as a diplomatic win for Beijing – and drew criticism from Washington and Brussels.In an interview with newspaper Corriere della Sera this summer, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto branded the 2019 decision as “wicked,” citing growing trade imbalances between the two countries.China imported $26.9 billion in Italian goods last year, compared with $21.4 billion in 2019. By contrast, Chinese exports to Italy rose to $50.5 billion from $33.5 billion over the same period, according to China’s customs data.Rome joined the scheme under former China-friendly Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who condemned the withdrawal in an interview posted to his Facebook page, saying it was made for “ideological reasons” and risked “scuppering” potential expansion of Italian exports.Chinese Ambassador to Italy Jia Guide earlier this year in an interview with Italian news outlet Fanpage suggested a “reckless” decision to withdraw from the pact would have a “negative” impact on cooperation.Italian leaders have appeared keen to navigate the withdrawal carefully, with Meloni repeatedly suggesting it was possible to have good relations with China outside the Belt and Road plan. She has also previously denied speculation that the United States pressured her to quit the scheme.The news of Rome’s withdrawal came as the delegation of top European Union officials arrived in Beijing for the first in-person EU-China summit in four years.The meeting was seen by Chinese leaders as a key opportunity to smooth contentious relations with Europe, which Beijing continues to see as a key potential counterweight in its competition with the United States.“We should not view each other as rivals just because our systems are different, reduce cooperation because competition exists, or engage in confrontation because there are disagreements,” Xi told the visiting leaders, according to China’s official readout.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel pressed Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the gaping trade deficit between their economies and “unfair competition,” while Li urged the EU to be “prudent” in its use of “restrictive” economic policies.Though the summit appeared to do little to resolve key issues, Von der Leyen said it saw both sides agree “that it is in our joint interest to have balanced trade relations.”The EU side would be looking for “concrete progress following these discussions,” the bloc said in a statement after the meeting.",4743,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/08/china/italy-belt-and-road-eu-china-summit-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220831104615-simone-mccarthy-byline-2022.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country european ursula raise reason refer top crosetto navigate win continue russia public resolve urge partnership side improve suggest bridge reckless competition economic port reduce newspaper appeal giorgia interview compare corriere concrete sensitive leave view china italy system maintain relation deal keen gap amid told key negative expand contentious qiang global repeatedly head reporter deny move accord prime friction benefit guido potential late past technology flagship extend smear saddle produce measure deficit meeting supply commission bloc guide sign reuters agree page custom confirm funnel facebook leyen period former press scheme wang year rome harden post inked follow complaint condemn wicked enormous result report spokesperson drew chain pledge belt official leader interest airport export withdraw expires prudent speculation firmly visit dollar program outlet defense charles unfair make xi europe giuseppe discussion imbalance possible unmanageable exists foreign expansion joint brand italian expect division withdrawal concern largely influence contract opportunity tie plan criticism road carefully united diplomatic secure attitude campaign previous pressure directly jinping president stoke economy summit hundred progress different restrictive minister comment stress smooth counterweight infrastructure grapple serum delegation rival wenbin state trade risk join opposes import union quit cooperation decision regular confrontation earlier fanpage grow jia systemic michel meloni sabotage scupper embark conte run engage disagreement council contrast tool point impact government previously arrive initiative ideological balance widely contention chinese time thursday statement brought issue washington office ministry news beijing show agreement tone summer bri ukraine march south pact attempt ambassador billion rise deem premier briefing,0.5226999999999999,0.06325110689437065,12.224009546539378,0.3595844296548523,0
CNN,How the impasse over Ukraine aid could have critical global ramifications,2023-12-08 00:01:00,Stephen Collinson,"America’s paralyzing political estrangement may soon change the world for the worse.Nearly two years into the war in Ukraine, a US lifeline of arms and ammunition is for the first time in real danger of collapsing, 12 months after President Volodymyr Zelensky was hailed as a hero during a Christmas visit to Washington. The assumption lying behind Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bid to wipe Ukraine off the map – that the US will lose interest in the war – is therefore close to being validated. This could set off serious consequences that would shake the foundation of US global leadership, alienate allies and embolden America’s sworn enemies.In the GOP-controlled House, hardline Republicans dedicated to ex-President Donald Trump’s “America First” philosophy want to cut Ukraine loose and leave it to its fate. A wider group of Republicans in both chambers of Congress, meanwhile, are using President Joe Biden’s new $60 billion aid request to try to force huge concessions on immigration policy.This is the latest occasion when conservative lawmakers, who lack mandates to enact their goals, are holding America’s national security priorities and global reputation hostage to their domestic political aims. The House recently passed an emergency aid package to bolster Israel’s war against Hamas – but included cuts to Internal Revenue Service funding that made it impossible for Senate Democrats and the White House to accept. That followed the refusal of scores of Republicans to vote to raise the government’s borrowing authority in May. Their stance forced then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy to use Democrats to pass a measure averting a global financial meltdown, fatally weakening his hold on the job.The rationale behind such political gambits? That the White House will eventually fold and capitulate to GOP demands because the consequences of doing nothing are so horrendous. But given the ever-narrowing Republican House majority, the inability of new Speaker Mike Johnson to govern and the nihilism of the pro-Trump wing of the conference, there’s no guarantee Ukraine aid would pass even then.The Ukrainian aid clash is so critical because American armaments have been essential to Kyiv’s success in repelling Putin’s brutal invasion. The country’s survival may depend on the flow of material continuing amid a bloody stalemate.But the situation has ramifications that go beyond a single nation’s existence.If the United States allows a country to be crushed in an illegal invasion, it will raise grave questions about the credibility of defense and strategic agreements that underpin the entire Western world. Such an outcome would increase the possibility that Putin would not stop at Ukraine and could eye other states once in the orbit of the former Soviet Union like Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia. Since this trio is in NATO, a Russian incursion would pitch the US into a direct war with nuclear-armed Russia and risk World War III.Furthermore, the abandonment of Ukraine would send a message to authoritarians like Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping that smaller adversaries can be crushed with impunity and that there are rewards for geopolitical gangsterism. It would confirm the belief of American adversaries, including Russia and China, that poisoned domestic politics will make it impossible for the US to wield superpower might and shield global democracy.But supporters of extending billions more dollars in aid to Ukraine also have an obligation to explain – in a more effective way than the administration has managed so far – why it is in the interests of every American to continue. This is especially the case as many voters struggle with high grocery prices and interest rates, feel their own country is heading in the wrong direction, and wonder why a war on the edge of Europe is their business.This is where the Republican position in the showdown has political potency. Even more moderate GOP figures are arguing that the Biden administration’s failure to control a surge of migrant crossings at the southern border means they have no choice but to use the Ukraine funding fight as leverage for tougher immigration policy. The argument is why, if Biden can’t control US borders, is he trying to save Ukraine’s?“I am very much in favor of getting support for Ukraine and support for Israel, but I also recognize the real politics of the United States House of Representatives will not give funding for Ukraine and Israel unless the border is secured,” GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said Wednesday. “That’s the reality.”The dispute over funding for Ukraine is a symptom of a deep philosophical clash over America’s role in the world that is already at the center of the possible 2024 rematch between Biden and Trump.The current commander in chief is squarely in the internationalist tradition of US presidents since World War II who saw the country as a bulwark for freedom, democracy and the rule of international law. Trump’s “America First” creed, however, springs from traditional US isolationism. It spurns democracy and alliances in favor of pursuing narrow national interests and transactional deal making with global tyrants and demagogues. This schism between these outlooks likely means that even if the current impasse over Ukraine funding is eventually resolved, it’s merely a taste of a long-running national feud to come.At the most fundamental level, the end of American support for Ukraine would mean the United States would be deserting people victimized by an unprovoked invasion, who have endured two years of carnage and atrocities all because they want the right to choose their nation’s destiny and leaders.If Washington turns its back, it would stain American leadership for decades, as Biden implicitly acknowledged in an impassioned speech at the White House on Wednesday.“I think it’s stunning that we’ve gotten to this point in the first place,” Biden said. “Russian forces are committing war crimes. It’s as simple as that. It’s stunning. Who is prepared to walk away from holding Putin accountable for this behavior? Who among us is really prepared to do that?”The imbroglio in Congress is already being felt on the Ukrainian frontlines. Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley, who co-chairs the Congressional Ukraine Caucus and visited the country earlier this fall, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto Wednesday that soldiers have had to “start rationing their munitions as any sensible army would” because they fear that the flow of US shells and bullets is about to dry up.One soldier, identified only as Sasha, told CNN’s Anna Coren on the frontlines, “I am afraid Ukraine will not be able to stand without our partners and allies. … It’s as simple as that.”In a broader strategic context, there are growing fears about what a loss of US aid to Ukraine would mean when its counter-offensive has stalled and when Putin is managing to reconstitute Russian forces battered by the war, partly through the help of other US adversaries like Iran and North Korea. One lesson of the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, which did not prompt the West to arm Ukraine, is that if Putin is not stopped he will keep going.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron made the case for continued US involvement on Thursday after meeting Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, pointing out that the cost of halting Putin’s aggression now paled in comparison to the price the US might have to pay down the road.“If there is a victory for Putin, it won’t be the end of this. I stood in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 2008, when he took the part of that country and warned this would happen,” Cameron, who previously served as prime minister, said. “And now it’s happened in Ukraine. And if we let it win in Ukraine, it will be somewhere else next, and it won’t just be American money. That’s a risk. It might be a NATO country, so it could be American lives,” Cameron said at the Aspen Security Forum conference in Washington.The loss of Ukraine would not just reverberate in Europe. In Asia, where the United States is confronting the implications of a rising China, a conclusion that the US deserts its friends could change Beijing’s calculations as it weighs whether to use military force to capture Taiwan. And a weakening of American resolve could prompt allies in the region and in the Middle East to doubt their security guarantees and consider whether to seek their own nuclear safety net.Republican Sen. Jim Risch of Idado made this point, also at the Aspen forum on Thursday, when he said: “If indeed the United States does not stand behind Ukraine, I worry about what our enemies would think, but I worry much more about what our allies would think.” Risch, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, added: “(If) they say, ‘We can’t count on the United States, we have got to have nuclear weapons,’ I really think a default in Ukraine would set off the largest nuclear race on the planet that we have ever seen.”Opposition to continuing to arm Ukraine is often not based on such deep thinking.Among some Republicans, it often appears to be motivated by politics. Trump appears to be still smarting over his first impeachment in the US House, which was set off by him trying to pressure Zelensky to open an investigation into Biden.The new House speaker, however, has raised some valid questions. Johnson wants a better accounting of where billions already spent have gone. And he wants to know the administration’s plan for ending the war. Still, the situation in Ukraine doesn’t lend itself to clear answers. Putin is seeking to outwait the United States. And the only endgame for Ukraine under such a vicious assault is survival, however long that takes.Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has spoken for many Ukraine skeptics in the GOP as he tries to harness isolationism in the party base. He likens US support for the country to “neoconservative” misadventures in Iraq and Afghanistan as he seeks to capitalize on voter fatigue with long wars abroad. This is the case even though no American troops are fighting in Ukraine.“We’re forking over more taxpayer money so some Ukrainian kleptocrat can buy a bigger house,” Ramaswamy said in a furious exchange on Fox News on Thursday, when he was asked why he would be comfortable “giving up” Eastern Europe to Russia.Ramaswamy’s arguments might work on a debate stage. But they ignore critical strategic considerations.And they also don’t answer a poignant question posed by Sasha, the Ukrainian frontline soldier. “If we let Ukraine go, if we let Putin win, who will feel themselves safe? No one.”",10601,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/08/politics/congress-ukraine-aid-global-ramifications/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150506104237-stephen-collinson-profile.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country philosophical raise spring anna increase depend afghanistan change confront investigation continue russia outcome resolve strategic caucus doubt reconstitute grave critical forum guarantee concession lose service adversary pursue large shake kleptocrat sasha korea argue happen western leave internationalist politics wrong relation law taiwan leverage told democratic cnn cost skeptic demand congressional america simple fox occasion stance creed financial global biden dedicate bloody head fork partner accounting ammunition comparison prime dry military late nation outlook lifeline meltdown region southern reverberate measure stand set involvement wipe sits north estrangement turn frontlines poignant taste map weaken former life wield vladimir utah stun supporter direct nuclear loss acknowledge impunity away single comfortable motivate clear middle interest afraid endure rationale rate gangsterism defense majority imbroglio partly munition shell foundation bullet surge xi europe ally internal hamas policy administration wing brutal lend bid showdown pal fatally orbit direction stood plan commit fear secure situation trio work recently support friend president jinping choose lawmaker enact gop part furious group revenue repel spoken hero presidential debate failure nihilism goal default conference feud consequence trump serve smart seek union identify democracy enemy save iraq carnage volodymyr entire position earlier soldier risch pay abroad include grow cameron lithuania kyiv give money georgia transactional alienate score time hold putin impasse collapse race house fold vicious tougher deep conservative invasion donald commander poison east halt endgame survival obligation freedom capitalize white reward ramaswamy edge prompt security lie committee funding zelensky leadership behavior army nato taxpayer send fall isolationism batter manage back hill valid narrow huge win harness argument russian request weighs worry weapon american stop long troop assumption dispute fundamental continued illegal close symptom warn fatigue underpin alliance hostage rule mike idado squarely armament china ukrainian aim inability hail christmas mandate vivek romney gambit assault govern open struggle start deal ration conclusion traditional amid borrowing kevin decade level fate sciutto senate tradition embolden reputation crime wonder capitulate spurns atrocity wednesday emergency possibility pose buy explain consider destiny package likens philosophy geopolitical eastern loose stall price role political small extend stage broader sworn current meeting answer planet avert secretary figure west authoritarian republican congress schism international candidate bulwark confirm border center speaker asia national fight safety flow opposition year crossing lack estonia spent impassioned follow felt leader prepared visit impeachment dollar speech validate case abandonment latvia paralyze iran crush moderate force party neoconservative make voter desert tbilisi chief misadventure tyrant aid possible annexation victory exchange foreign indeed eye context favor unprovoked lesson refusal potency united safe effective aspen success israel pressure pitch hardline month question add bolster minister johnson message horrendous superpower implicitly walk quigley david base chamber incursion state priority risk ignore place victimize outwait grocery demagogue control high feel representative big frontline vote belief rematch danger mccarthy material real point government previously soviet recognize accountable world impossible clash calculation shield crimea chinese cut thursday capitol joe washington especially domestic immigration authority credibility stain news beijing agreement essential count accept implication migrant aggression arm eventually wider ramification ukraine capture billion rise choice coren pass democrat,-0.9932,0.19809451938496367,9.764189325276938,0.3874609379817713,0
CNN,‘Laws need to change’: Stella McCartney calls for new tariffs on leather and polluting materials,2023-12-07 22:58:00,Christy Choi,"Stella McCartney has called on world leaders to introduce new tariffs on leather goods, as well as fashion items made from polluting or environmentally unsustainable materials.Speaking to CNN’s Becky Anderson at the UN’s Climate Change Conference (COP28) in the United Arab Emirates this week, the fashion designer said she can be taxed at a rate that’s “up to 30% more” for non-leather bags or shoes entering the US market.“If I put a sliver of animal leather onto that same product, the tax disappears. That is a law that needs to swap,” said McCartney, calling current tariff structures “crazy.”“You need to be penalized if you’re cutting down the rainforests and using cancerous toxins to tan leather and human welfare is at risk.”A longstanding advocate of sustainable and vegan fashion, McCartney said she felt alone in her drive to develop new alternative materials. “The reality is I’m still the only one working this way,” she said.The designer also used COP28 to announce a new collaboration with Mango Materials, a company using waste methane gas to feed bacteria that produce a biopolymer for use in items like sunglasses frames.“These bad ugly businesses are getting the tax breaks; they’re getting the incentives,” McCartney said, addressing Mango Materials CEO Molly Morse — who appeared alongside her during the CNN interview — after the civil engineer said her startup would consider using excess methane from oil and gas companies to produce its biomaterial.“Your business should be getting paid all of that benefit to be making them clean,” McCartney continued.In a wide-ranging interview, the designer called on COP28 delegates to “stop ignoring that the fashion industry is one of the most harmful industries to the world.”The fashion industry’s environmental impact is difficult to quantify, but the United Nations Environment Program said fast fashion contributes “around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions due to its long supply chains and energy intensive production.” Animal rights group PETA, which is now targeting the wool, leather and down trades, meanwhile claims that more than 1.4 billion animals, including cows, sheep and goats, are killed each year for leather.“We need policy change. We need laws to be looked at. We need limitations, then we can all work together as an industry,” said McCartney.While some animal rights advocates push for leather substitutes, many come with their own environmental costs.Materials marketed as vegan leather are often made from two plastic polymers — polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyurethane (PU), or a combination of the latter and some kind of natural material. While synthetic leather is animal-free and has a lower environmental impact than animal leather, according to a study in the journal Nature Sustainability, its manufacture often uses hazardous chemicals and fossil fuels. And like most plastics, the materials can take centuries to break down.There are new alternatives being produced, including biodegradable “leathers” made from fungi or bacterial cellulose from industrial fruit waste, but not all are widely available on the market.As part of a move away from fossil fuel-based synthetics, McCartney’s label has used Mylo, a material made from mycelium (the root-like structures of mushrooms), to produce a line of handbags called The Frayme Mylo. Earlier this year, however, the firm behind Mylo, Bolt Threads, announced that it had ceased operations, telling Vogue Business that the company had been unable to sufficiently scale up production.“I’ve been a fashion designer for my whole life, and I’m not as interested in what the next silhouette is, or what the next color is in 2024 and ‘25,” McCartney told CNN. “I’m like, ‘What’s the next material?

CNN,Utah officials temporarily delay ballot access filing deadline after RFK Jr. lawsuit,2023-12-07 20:54:00,,"Utah election officials have agreed to temporarily delay the enforcement of its January 8 ballot access filing deadline for independent candidates after Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign sued the officials to permanently move the deadline to August.Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said in a court filing on Wednesday that Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson and state Director of Elections Ryan Cowley have agreed to not enforce the deadline to apply for ballot access for independent candidates until March 5, allowing Kennedy’s campaign an additional two months to gather signatures.The Utah officials agreed to delay enforcement of the deadline to comply with federal Judge David Nuffer’s requested schedule to process the preliminary injunction filed by the Kennedy campaign. Nuffer said the state of Utah must reply to the preliminary injunction by January 8, and he will hold a hearing on the injunction, if necessary, the following week, the court filing said.For Kennedy – who ended his Democratic primary challenge to President Joe Biden in October in favor of an independent presidential bid – Utah provides the first test of his campaign’s ability to meet the logistical and financial hurdles of its stated goal of appearing on the ballot in all 50 states. Utah’s deadline is the earliest in the country for unaffiliated candidates, and missing the deadline could take Kennedy out of the running for Utah’s six electoral votes.Kennedy’s campaign touted the temporary delay as a “major concession” from the state. Paul Rossi, the attorney representing the campaign in the case, praised Henderson’s “courage” to move the deadline back.“I am pleased Lt. Governor Henderson had the courage to correct the wrong committed by the state legislature in their intentional assault on the constitutional right of Utah voters to cast their vote for Mr. Kennedy in 2024,” Rossi said in a statement released by the campaign.Kennedy criticized the state officials who he says are attempting to “prevent popular candidates from getting on the ballot.”“In a democracy, the people are supposed to decide with their votes who gets into office. Not state officials who prevent popular candidates from getting on the ballot,” Kennedy said in a statement.CNN has reached out to Henderson’s office for additional comment.",2312,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/rfk-utah-temporarily-delay-ballot-access-filing/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231110210019-rfk-jr-file-111023.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country hurdle meet case request enforce judge courage henderson schedule preliminary voter court major concession injunction independent suppose favor bid nuffer early pleased popular permanently access logistical temporary commit enforcement primary electoral campaign assault president month represent correct wrong attorney unaffiliated comment deidre governor david criticize presidential cowley democratic intentional release goal week gov state reach delay wednesday file praise ability cast ballot robert reply financial challenge democracy biden move decide rossi temporarily lt vote process federal kennedy director prevent deadline paul general run october hold miss joe statement additional agree candidate test office comply reyes provide apply legislature filing utah election constitutional hearing ryan march follow tout attempt gather january official,0.84355,0.0,11.593673965936738,0.44670868347338943,0
CNN,"Man accused of firing shotgun outside synagogue in upstate New York is taken into custody, police say",2023-12-08 00:24:00,Sabrina Shulman,"A man accused of firing a shotgun twice outside a synagogue in New York’s capital on Thursday afternoon was taken into custody, and police are investigating whether it was a hate crime, Albany’s police chief said.The 28-year-old man is accused of saying “Free Palestine” and firing the gun outside Temple Israel in Albany, city Police Chief Eric Hawkins told reporters, without releasing the person’s name. No injuries were reported after the gunfire, which came hours before the observance of Hanukkah would begin.The FBI’s Albany office, in a statement released to CNN affiliate WRGB Thursday night, said Mufid Fawaz Alkhader was arrested and charged after the incident, without saying whether Alkhader was the person accused of firing the shots. Alkhader was charged with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, the FBI statement reads.More information will be provided by the US attorney’s office after an initial court appearance scheduled for Friday morning in a federal district court in Albany, the statement from the FBI’s Albany office reads.The gunshots were fired into the air, a law enforcement source and a state official told CNN. Shotgun shells were found on a staircase leading to the front of the building, police said.After the shots were fired, a suspect fled a few hundred yards from the parking lot and was confronted by a person in a vehicle, according to Hawkins, the Albany police chief. The suspect told the man in the vehicle he felt victimized, Hawkins said.The suspect then dropped the shotgun and police took him into custody, Hawkins said. Based on the information police have, the man acted alone and there was no broader threat to the community, according to Hawkins.Further details about what led to the gunfire weren’t immediately available. Hawkins said investigators were checking whether the gunfire was a hate crime, but that he didn’t immediately know what charges the detainee would face.New York State Police and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were interviewing the suspect, and investigators were looking at the possibility of firearms charges, a law enforcement source told CNN before the FBI announced an arrest. They also were tracing the gun to see if the suspect possessed it legally or if it was stolen, the source said.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul directed state police and the National Guard to increase existing Hanukkah patrols following the incident.“Federal, state, and local law enforcement are investigating and I’ve spoken to the Rabbi, assuring her that the State will do everything in our power to restore the sense of security her community needs,” Hochul said in a post on X.Any act of antisemitism would be unacceptable, “and undermining the public safety at a synagogue on the first night of Hanukkah is even more deplorable,” Hochul said in a news conference Thursday. “As New Yorkers, this is not who we are. This must stop. We reject hate, antisemitism, Islamophobia all hate crimes must stop and all violence in every form must cease.”",3042,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/us/albany-synagogue-shots-fired-new-york/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230112171909-john-miller-profile.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police yard lot available steal islamophobia increase person gunfire confront firearm fbi morning staircase mufid public fire parking threat unacceptable shell gunshot alkhader appearance assure schedule charge stop chief trace court custody vehicle palestine city restore free air possess power guard patrol interview hate hour arrest enforcement shotgun eric israel hochul temple fawaz bureau front hundred attorney law rabbi spoken kathy told deplorable building cnn base release alcohol incident hawkins lead gov check conference state crime suspect wrgb tobacco victimize possibility legally albany injury reporter yorkers local accord york information federal capital drop antisemitism broader violence night hanukkah possession explosive prohibit announce thursday statement form cease detail initial office affiliate shot news provide national exist accuse safety friday undermine gun observance immediately detainee investigator direct post source follow act district report security found synagogue community felt reject flee investigate official afternoon,-0.99045,0.09861932938856016,10.063604240282686,0.4004545454545455,0
CNN,Hunter Biden faces nine criminal charges in federal tax case,2023-12-07 23:18:00,Evan Perez,"Hunter Biden has been charged in connection with a long-running Justice Department investigation into his taxes – the second criminal case that special counsel David Weiss has brought against President Joe Biden’s son.The charges span nine counts, including failure to file and pay taxes; evasion of assessment; and false or fraudulent tax return. CNN was first to report a new criminal case had been filed.According to the special counsel’s team, Hunter Biden “engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million” in taxes that he owed from 2016 through 2019. Though Hunter Biden did eventually pay his taxes from 2018, prosecutors allege that he included “false business deductions in order to evade assessment of taxes to reduce the substantial tax liabilities he faced.”Prosecutors also allege in the 56-page indictment that he “subverted the payroll and tax withholding process of his own company” by withdrawing millions of dollars outside of its payroll and tax withholding process.The president’s son “spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills,” according to the indictment, which states that “between 2016 and October 15, 2020, the Defendant spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes.”The indictment also referenced Hunter Biden’s 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things,” in which he detailed some of his personal struggles with addiction and substance abuse. He was paid more than $140,000 related to the book from January through October 15, 2020, according to the indictment.Hunter Biden’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that “based on the facts and the law, if Hunter’s last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought.”“First, U.S. Attorney Weiss bowed to Republican pressure to file unprecedented and unconstitutional gun charges to renege on a non-prosecution resolution. Now, after five years of investigating with no new evidence – and two years after Hunter paid his taxes in full – the U.S. Attorney has piled on nine new charges when he had agreed just months ago to resolve this matter with a pair of misdemeanors,” he continued.Lowell had sent a letter to Weiss on Tuesday asking to speak with prosecutors “before any additional charging decisions are made.” He said in his Thursday statement that the “customary meeting to discuss this investigation” did not occur.Asked for comment, the White House referred CNN to the Justice Department and Hunter Biden’s representatives.In a news release announcing the charges Thursday, the Justice Department said Hunter Biden could face a maximum of 17 years in prison if convicted of the charges.The case had been close to being resolved in July when a plea deal fell apart. The new tax case stems from Hunter Biden’s lucrative overseas business dealings – including his involvement with Ukrainian energy company Burisma and a Chinese private equity fund – which are at the center of House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden.Now, the president will be campaigning for a second White House term and fighting a Republican impeachment bid while his son fights to avoid prison in two criminal cases.According to court filings from the now-defunct plea deal, Hunter Biden repeatedly missed IRS deadlines to pay his federal taxes on time, and eventually owed about $2 million to the government. He paid the money back in 2021, with a loan from a friend.Federal prosecutors have been scrutinizing Hunter Biden’s finances since 2018, and Trump-appointed US attorney David Weiss was designated special counsel in August.The probe appeared to be winding down this summer when Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors, and prosecutors would recommend no jail time. They also agreed that a gun charge would be dropped in two years if he stayed out of legal trouble.But both proposed deals collapsed after scrutiny from a federal judge and disagreements over the fine print. Then Weiss indicted Hunter Biden in September on three charges related to his purchase of a gun from a shop in Delaware in 2018 at a time prosecutors say he was an illegal drug user. He has pleaded not guilty in the gun possession and false statements case.Hunter Biden’s attorneys previously accused Weiss of “bending to political pressure” from Republicans and said that his actions “present a grave threat to our system of justice.”One of the reasons Republicans have attacked Weiss is because of testimony from two IRS whistleblowers who were involved in the probe and said they witnessed political interference by the Justice Department. The whistleblowers said career IRS agents recommended felony tax charges against Hunter Biden in early 2022.Weiss and Attorney General Merrick Garland have refuted the whistleblowers’ claims.Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from private equity deals, corporate consulting and legal fees in Ukraine, China, Romania and other countries. Prosecutors previously said he had the money to buy luxury items like a Porsche and was warned about his looming tax bills by accountants and associates – but still missed the IRS deadlines.House Republicans have zeroed in on many of these overseas deals as part of their own probes.They’ve uncovered some evidence that Hunter Biden leveraged his father’s position to make money. But their impeachment inquiry is largely based on their unproven claims that Joe Biden was involved in “corrupt” business deals with his son.To date, federal prosecutors have never offered any evidence backing up GOP claims that Joe Biden was in business with his son or abused his powers to enrich his family.This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.",5871,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/hunter-biden-criminal-case/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220208113910-evan-perez-2022-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country user shop hunter reason owe refer rental short unproven investigation back stayed return recommend deduction resolve uncovered threat grave discus book charge illegal close agent reduce power warn defendant girlfriend detailed full beautiful abuse stem consult china ukrainian offer company system struggle matter evasion law deal allege burisma property cnn escort release scrutinize bill romania file inquiry exotic avoid story buy present repeatedly department biden customary dealing evidence extravagant equity accord career energy false california witness deadline political drop october meeting designate corporate leveraged private loom involvement possession indict million fell action republican agree unprecedented evade ago reference center fight filing accuse print backing scheme memoir fee enrich year gun spent claim span fraudulent delaware payroll related renege report headline january clothing prosecutor scrutiny team assessment withdraw september impeachment dollar associate merrick addiction criminal justice case bow liability garland pile guilty attack tax judge make special jail court subvert purchase july bid largely early paid substantial zeroed legal campaign pressure president tuesday month maximum convict date attorney porsche gop probe part comment interference plea withholding unconstitutional prison david irs loan failure overseas base term fact plead state personal misdemeanor finance lowell luxury update decision car speak position process pay federal felony include fund general connection engage disagreement refute government previously money father announce involve chinese order time thursday corrupt miss collapse joe statement brought additional item lucrative house accountant news testimony letter pair wei count development propose fine summer eventually ukraine indictment white investigate wind business resolution substance nature counsel lifestyle bending whistleblower,-0.99265,0.15329586101175266,11.66003831417624,0.39987068487068494,0
CNN,Liz Cheney says she was disgusted by school leaders’ testimony to Congress on antisemitism,2023-12-07 18:46:00,,"Former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney on Thursday weighed in on controversial comments from university leaders on antisemitism and genocide, calling their testimony on Capitol Hill this week “disgusting” and “stunning.”“To see the lack of willingness of these leaders of what are supposed to be the best educational institutions, not just in the United States, but around the world, unwilling to say very clearly, that calling for the genocide of Jews constitutes harassment,” Cheney told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead.” “It is really troubling what we’re seeing on campuses around this country.”Her comments come days after the presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology were pressed by House lawmakers about their responses to alleged incidents of antisemitism on their campuses in the days and weeks following the start of the Israel-Hamas war. During the hearing, the presidents struggled to answer questions about whether calling for the genocide of Jews violated their respective school’s code of conduct on bullying or harassment.The presidents of Penn and Harvard have since issued statements attempting to clarify their testimony.“There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,” Harvard President Claudine Gay said in the new statement posted on X. “Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”In a short video released Wednesday night, Penn President Liz Magill echoed Gay’s response and said the university would immediately review and clarify its policies on hate speech.“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”Cheney, who spoke with Tapper while promoting her new book “Oath and Honor: A Memoir and a Warning,” also called out Washington state Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who has faced recent criticism over not more forcefully condemning sexual assaults committed by Hamas during its October 7 terror attack.Jayapal, in comments to CNN’s Dana Bash on ”State of the Union” over the weekend, condemned the rape of Israeli women by Hamas as “horrific” but noted that over 15,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since the start of the war, saying: “I think we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians.”In a Tuesday statement, Jayapal said that her comment “about balance was not about rape, and not intended to minimize rape and sexual assault in any way.” She went on in the statement to “unequivocally condemn Hamas’ use of rape and sexual violence as an act of war.”Noting that Jayapal clarified her remarks, Cheney said that “there’s no clarification that can explain and justify anything except complete horror, and standing against the slaughter, the attacks that we saw on October 7.”“It tells you about a sense in our society today, of people unwilling to stand up against this growing antisemitism, it’s very dangerous,” she said. “It shouldn’t be a partisan issue.”",3511,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/liz-cheney-university-presidents-antisemitism-congress-cnntv/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207173651-liz-cheney-interview-120723-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bullying unequivocally harvard response short hill complete dangerous jewish threaten kill intend genocide code attack caucus massachusetts book rape unwilling promote willingness hamas outrage disgust policy vile suppose violate free bash jake warn hate criticism united recent claudine x campus expression commit weekend religious condone assault president institution chair tuesday lawmaker struggle question partisan start slaughter review comment allege day honor group forcefully constitutes told irrefutable evil cnn release congressional incident week ethnic fact state simple school place justify wednesday terrible pramila union minimize tapper explain progressive note penn focus magill educational grow jayapal gay video dana technology clarify gaza antisemitism october violence night oath world stand answer balance woman spoke horror society student conduct harassment university thursday republican respective idea capitol echoed statement issue washington house pennsylvania today israeli clarification plain testimony terror sexual former press remark confuse memoir bring lack immediately liz jew hearing horrific post palestinian controversial cheney follow trouble human held condemn act attempt weigh institute community clear call leader perpetrate,-0.9981,0.25633722586157787,9.800956651718984,0.4602501761804087,0
CNN,Images from Gaza show Israeli soldiers detaining dozens of men stripped to underwear,2023-12-07 21:28:00,Abeer Salman,"Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.The exact circumstances and dates of the detentions are unclear, but some of the detainees’ identities were confirmed by colleagues or family members.At least some of the men are civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a conversation CNN had with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor posted an image of one detainment and said in a statement on its website Thursday that “the Israeli army detained and severely abused dozens of Palestinian civilians.”“Euro-Med Monitor received reports that Israeli forces launched random and arbitrary arrest campaigns against displaced people, including doctors, academics, journalists, and elderly men,” it said.The Israel Defense Forces has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on the images. CNN has geo-located some of the images to Beit Lahia, north of Gaza City.The Israeli media, without indicating a source, has portrayed the images as the surrender of Hamas members. A journalist asked IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari about the images during a news conference on Thursday, saying, “We’ve seen images of many captives, Hamas terrorists, that the IDF arrested during the ground maneuvering.”Hagari said that, in fighting Hamas, “those left in the area gradually come out.”“We investigate and check who has ties to Hamas, and who does not,” he said. “We arrest them all and question them. We will continue dismantling each one of those strongholds until we are done.”In a statement Thursday, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed said that one of its correspondents and several members of his family were among those detained as part of the incident portrayed in the images.“Today, Thursday, the Israeli occupation army arrested the journalist and the director of ‘The New Arab’ office in Gaza, our colleague Diaa Al-Kahlot, from Market Street in Beit Lahia, along with a group of his brothers, relatives, and other civilians,” Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote.“The occupation deliberately forced Gazans to take off their clothes, searched them, and humiliated them when they were arrested before taking them to an unknown destination, according to what the people there told us. Pictures and video clips spread showing soldiers arresting dozens of Gazans using criminal and humiliating method.”Hussam Kanafani, the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed editor-in-chief, said in the statement that Al-Kahlot and his family were still missing.“We will make every effort possible, in cooperation with international institutions and organizations concerned with the rights and freedom of journalists in the world, to determine the whereabouts of our colleague Diaa and release him as soon as possible,” Kanafani said.CNN spoke with a relative of other detained men, Hani al-Madhoun, from his home in the United States.“Israeli forces arrived on the street and called out all the men to come out, and they complied,” al-Madhoun told CNN. “This house was their place of refuge after our two homes were destroyed.”Al-Madhoun said he was in contact with his sister, who is in Gaza.He said that he recognized his cousin Aboud in one of the photographs and saw his brother Mahmood in a video. He said that Mahmoud is a shopkeeper and Aboud “is not involved in any activities; he helps his father in construction.”This is a developing story and will be updated.",3621,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/middleeast/gaza-israeli-soldiers-detained-men-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/90b413dc-4d61-4822-acba-e047b404529f.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,army dozen respond social affiliation idf diaa academic criminal militant relative defense refuge cousin continue conversation request gradually mass force make develop employer mahmood monitor launch possible hamas correspondent severely random doctor kneel kanafani mahmoud detention tie elderly united family humiliate abuse arrest hani journalist terrorist effort israel occupation campaign brother stronghold institution wear determine cargo date question receive detainment admiral part comment group lahia arab gazans told cnn underwear release sister incident ground conference check strip displace place street clothes medium pack image update cooperation colleague story clip hagari destination rear contact accord photograph soldier include beit director military arbitrary video activity gaza blindfold recognize left captive deliberately world arrive father spoke indicate aboud home north involve circulate thursday detain spread statement international shopkeeper market house circumstance hussam office identity today israeli news concerned comply confirm dismantle show unclear website daniel fight search unknown picture exact detainee post palestinian source freedom bed surrender human portrayed member whereabouts report spokesperson call area organization investigate civilian,-0.97805,0.0,10.830015037593984,0.32884848484848483,0

CNN,An iconic collaboration between the worlds of high fashion and dance,2023-12-07 17:52:00,Ann Binlot,"Marc Happel used to turn the pages of glossy fashion books and magazines, wondering if he should have taken a different career path — into fashion instead of costume design.But as it happened, his path grew to span both those lanes.Happel was named director of costumes at the New York City Ballet (NYCB) in 2006. And following New York Fashion Week’s arrival at Lincoln Center — otherwise known as the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and also the home of the NYCB — in 2010, four year later, the ballet’s then master-in-chief Peter Martins and his friend, “Sex and the City” actor Sarah Jessica Parker, had a fateful idea: to invite fashion designers to create costumes for its star-studded annual fundraiser, the Fall Fashion Gala.“With so much creativity and experimentation right on our doorstep, we decided to harness it,” explained Parker, a long-time NYCB patron, in a foreword for Happel’s new book documenting the collaboration, “and the idea of regularly inviting designers of high fashion into City Ballet was born.”In 2012, Martins invited another old friend, Valentino Garavani, to design costumes for the inaugural Fall Fashion Gala. The iconic Italian designer, who had by then retired from his namesake label, agreed; Happel was asked to collaborate with him to create the looks for three performances, including “Bal de Couture” — a ballet Martins choreographed in tribute to Valentino.“He was amazing to work with,” said Happel of Garavani, who visited the ballet’s costume shop for two hours every day during the design process. “He took great interest in details… It really inspired him to open up again and, and use his designer skills.”Under Valentino’s direction, Happel and his team crafted costumes ranging from couture gowns to monochromatic tutus, using materials like tulle, lace, duchess satin, crystals, and feathers.Since then, the ballet company has made an annual tradition of partnering with fashion’s elite. Happel has worked with more than 30 famed designers — including Virgil Abloh, Carolina Herrera, Thom Browne, Prabal Gurung, Giles Deacon (twice), and Sarah Burton — for the Gala, and its specially curated performances. And to commemorate its 10th anniversary, as well as the 75th anniversary of the storied dance company, Happel authored his very own monograph celebrating the collaborations: “New York City Ballet: Choreography & Couture.”Happel honed his skills at Minneapolis’ Guthrie Theater for two years before setting off for New York in 1978 when he heard that the famed choreographer Bob Fosse was short-staffed and desperately hiring costume designers for “Dancin,’” a new Broadway musical. Happel drove from the Midwest on spec and was hired to work on the production. In the years that followed, he cut his teeth on numerous other Broadway shows as a freelance designer before landing at New York’s Metropolitan Opera House in 2001 to manage men’s costumes, a role he held until his move to the NYCB.For the most part, Happel and his 18-person team of seamstresses, patternmakers, and dyers update and restore costumes from the days of George Balanchine, the legendary choreographer who co-founded the New York City Ballet (with the impresario and philanthropist Lincoln Kirstein) in 1948 and served as its artistic director until his death some 35 years later.“It’s about recreating the same costumes if they’ve worn out, or trying to rebuild parts to keep them looking fresh — like they did when they originally premiered,” Happel said.The ballet’s costume department creates or refurbishes anywhere from 40 up to and 150 costumes a year. Lately, the team’s focus has been stitching together costumes for the holiday favorite “The Nutcracker,” which runs through December 31 this season.Happel knows just how to manipulate a silhouette to best align it with a dancer’s needs. “During a fitting, we will ask the dancers to move and try steps from the actual choreography to make sure the costume is moving the way it should, and not restricting the dancer in any way,” he explained. “We have many tricks and strategies.”When the NYCB collaborated with Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida of the London-based label Marques’Almeida in 2015, for example, the designers first envisaged garments that had ties and pieces of fabric attached — but in motion, the embellishments kept wrapping around dancers’ arms and legs, limiting their movement, so they had to be shortened or removed.“Marc really listens and collaborates with the dancers, to make sure we feel comfortable and confident in what we’re wearing,” said Indiana Woodward, a principal dancer with the Ballet. “He is extremely talented at creating beautiful costumes (and) — even more importantly — creating costumes you feel beautiful dancing in. If it’s a flowing skirt, you feel like you’re floating, or like you can jump higher.”In the Fall Fashion Gala’s early years, Sarah Jessica Parker (who is now a vice chair of the NYCB’s board of directors) took responsibility for creating a short list of potential collaborators. Happel has since taken over, and NYCB artistic director Jonathan Stafford paid tribute to his “uniquely critical eye.“In addition to maintaining and preserving the company’s existing costumes, he also creates beautiful designs of his own,” Stafford said. “He has worked with an amazing roster of designers over the years, always managing to bring their vision to life on our stage.”Every designer who’s partnered with the Ballet has had their own way of working, Happel explained. Thom Browne was, “very hands-on and very much wanted to be a part of what was going on here,” he recalled. “He loved challenging the shop in creating details.” Iris van Herpen, meanwhile, sent a handwritten letter with sketches of her designs, which consisted of intricate, cut-out shapes. Happel then enlisted the help of an architectural firm to design a custom computer program that sped up the construction process. “It printed out all of these shapes for us, which was incredible, because it saved us so much time,” said Happel.In 2016, when the ballet collaborated with Dries Van Noten, Happel traveled to Antwerp to meet the celebrated Belgian designer. “That was just for me heaven because to suddenly be immersed in (his) world was just incredible,” he said. Conversely, Happel never met, saw or talked to Raf Simons during their collaboration on costumes for the 2022 Gala, however, as the designer instead sent through finished designs. “The clothes came in and we had to do quite a bit of adjustments because although it was interesting, it masked the body too much,” he remembered.Although he’s not a fashion designer in the traditional sense, Happel has certainly worked with the best. “When you have 10 years of an event that’s involved 30 world-class fashion designers, it’s something that I felt like needed to be recorded,” said Happel of his work and the “Choreography & Couture” tome. “Through photography, and through the sketches, which I thought were very important for every designer, you give an audience a closer look at these costumes.”",7087,https://www.cnn.com/style/new-york-city-ballet-fashion-choreography-couture/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/05-ballet-choreography-couturev2.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,antwerp shop heard freelance metropolitan uniquely fall record short gurung manage iris gown harness choreographer conversely retire addition shape enlist celebrate critical guthrie book recreate storied choreographed talented experimentation firm annual bal herpen body audience tulle regularly fitting rebuild shorten happen roster beautiful marc restrict trick company open kirstein leg maintain opera day traditional theater patternmaker amaze dyer namesake tradition wonder travel dancer couture tribute inspire attach photography department explain designer tome valentino partner fashion move glossy woodward teeth production browne burton career dry event sarah thom foreword originally potential elite role nutcracker artistic construction board lincoln arrival anniversary heaven philanthropist set simon collaborator home george finish idea talk carolina bit agree design favorite page doorstep custom curated commemorate marta incredible immerse skirt center turn print exist confident flow life tutu performance broadway bring year lace span step sketch listens giles follow monochromatic held comfortable duchess parker impresario december felt fundraiser preserve collaboration handwritten choreography costume extremely team vice interest spec martin motion visit responsibility crystal belgian virgil meet embellishment program minneapolis collaborate almeida intricate range specially label author make bob city italian dance restore iconic fateful early perform instead hire fresh patron paid direction tie ballet limit paulo architectural hour skill marque worn inaugural masked work importantly path friend satin herrera garavani deacon movement chair wear actual land indiana different manipulate part death silhouette monograph refurbishes stafford seamstress abloh midwest love week consist vision creativity serve jessica jonathan clothes wrap update challenge save high feel decide focus piece york suddenly invite process drove include grow gala director material balanchine document important legendary run give world musical recall involve time cut holiday prabal house art envisage desperately float computer show letter principal nycb noten create craft dancin happel numerous closer list sex creates arm speed raf adjustment magazine garment align fabric great collaborates premier famed stitch actor jump,0.9973,0.21165514321998025,8.948612716763005,0.5584728714358344,0
CNN,New York Democrats nominate former congressman for special election to succeed George Santos,2023-12-07 18:49:00,Gloria Pazmino,"New York Democrats have nominated former Rep. Tom Suozzi for the special election to succeed expelled Republican Rep. George Santos.Suozzi represented a previous version of New York 3rd Congressional District, on the north shore of Long Island, for three terms before vacating the seat to launch an ultimately unsuccessful primary challenge to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul last year.“Tom Suozzi has a proven record of fighting for his constituents, fighting to safeguard our suburban way of life here on Long Island and Queens and always advocating for sensible solutions to the real challenges affecting every day average Americans,” Jay Jacobs and Rep. Gregory Meeks, the chairs of the Democratic Party in Nassau and Queens counties, said in a joint statement.Under New York’s special election rules, nominees are selected by the county party leaders in the district.Hochul has scheduled the special election to fill the seat for February 13.The race to succeed Santos will take on added significance next year, given Republicans’ razor-thin majority in the House – which will only get thinner, at least temporarily, with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy leaving the chamber at the end of this year. Already, the race is being discussed as a key bellwether ahead of the November 2024 general election.Last week, Santos became only the sixth lawmaker to be expelled from Congress after an Ethics Committee report concluded he had “sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.” Santos has also pleaded not guilty to 23 federal charges, including allegations of fraud related to Covid-19 unemployment benefits, misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on House disclosure reports.Suozzi is expected to officially announce his campaign on Saturday.“I delivered for this district before, and I will do it again by putting you ahead of partisanship. Let’s reject the nonsense and get back to work,” the former congressman said in a statement Thursday.Republican leaders in Queens and Nassau counties have yet to announce their nominee. A request for comment was not immediately returned.Suozzi entered the race to challenge Santos in October prior to the congressman’s expulsion. Support of the county organizations will be crucial in helping to marshal resources and kickstarting fundraising in what is expected to be a short and potentially low-turnout election.Covering parts of Queens and Nassau counties, the district and its earlier versions had long been represented by Democrats until Santos’ surprising victory in an open-seat race in 2022. Two years earlier, Santos had lost to Suozzi by double digits.Prior to his three terms in Congress, Suozzi spent eight years leading Nassau County as county executive and also served as the mayor of Glen Cove. Considered a moderate Democrat, Suozzi also lost two bids for his party’s nomination for governor – he finished third in the primary against Hochul last year and lost a 2006 bid to Eliot Spitzer. His primary challenge against Hochul was bitter, and the governor had considered blocking his bid to be the 3rd District nominee, before clearing the way for him in return for certain concessions.Suozzi will be hoping that the backlash to Santos’ many scandals will endanger Republican momentum in the district. But his mission to reclaim the seat may be harder than national observers expect, local Democrats told CNN’s Ronald Brownstein recently. While President Joe Biden would have carried the district under its current lines by 8 points in 2020, the GOP has made gains in elections on Long Island since then, largely around concerns about crime, immigration and inflation, including the high cost of housing.This story has been updated with additional information.",3805,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/tom-suozzi-democrats-santos-special-election/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1243257901.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,allegation enter november succeed record short back return line vacate seat request backlash sought gregory version american ahead charge long congressman lose crucial momentum nomination rule leave primary cove hochul constituent represent sixth put day kevin told democratic key cnn cost congressional executive gov thinner crime eliot conclude resource tom financial story biden carry expel consider deliver local fundraise temporarily information benefit meeks safeguard suburban october ronald current shore north george republican finish congress advocate exploit speaker national fight former life kickstarting year immediately spent nominee misuse disclosure related officially report fraud leader double nassau majority inflation average guilty party nonsense glen moderate make schedule special surprising launch victory joint expect bid largely concern marshal proven work county discuss recently support campaign previous ethic chair president jacob lawmaker bellwether partisanship add gop part comment governor kathy candidacy observer term chamber lead week plead significance personal serve jay finance select update clearing challenge high reclaim york affect prior earlier federal aspect include mayor mccarthy island fund general suozzi real point brownstein queen give solution february bitter fraudulently announce race joe statement endanger additional hop mission house immigration unsuccessful potentially expulsion ultimately election block harder nominate fill spitzer scandal santos district reject lie organization unemployment democrat committee,-0.6976,0.07884362680683311,12.415281582952815,0.39545028741750055,0
CNN,Defense policy bill includes short-term extension of controversial government surveillance program,2023-12-07 17:22:00,Clare Foran,"A critical annual defense policy bill that lawmakers are pushing to pass before the end of the year will include a short-term extension of a controversial law that permits warrantless surveillance of foreign nationals.The issue has set up a leadership test for House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, and has already generated intense pushback from some on the right.Lawmakers released a negotiated compromise version of the National Defense Authorization Act this week, which temporarily extends authority for the surveillance program through April 19.The law, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, enables the US government to obtain intelligence by collecting communications records of foreign persons based overseas who are using US-based communications services.Supporters argue Section 702 is a critical tool for safeguarding national security, but it has come under scrutiny from some lawmakers over alleged misuse.The searches are governed by a set of internal rules and procedures designed to protect Americans’ privacy and civil liberties, but critics say that loopholes allow the FBI to search the data it collects for Americans’ information﻿ – as opposed to from foreign adversaries – without proper justification.Tensions have flared on Capitol Hill over the extension in the defense policy bill.Johnson and GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida were seen having what appeared to be an extended, heated conversation on the House floor Thursday. Gaetz told CNN the conversation was over NDAA, particularly the bill’s extension of Section 702.“I’m concerned about the FISA extension,” said Gaetz, who does not support the FISA reauthorization in its current form.Gaetz said of the conversation, “I wouldn’t consider it heated,” and described it as a “policy discussion.”CNN observed Johnson and Gaetz pointing fingers at each other engaged in a prolonged back and forth that appeared to grow increasingly contentious.Despite the conversation, Gaetz said Johnson still has his support and added, “I want the speaker to be successful.”CNN has reached out to Johnson’s office to ask for comment.On Wednesday, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia expressed major frustration over leadership’s handling of the defense policy bill, citing a variety of issues. “They gave a clean authorization for FISA all the way into April, and they stuffed that in the bill too,” Greene told CNN’s Manu Raju. “That wasn’t something that we had talked about before.”Gaetz also told CNN on Wednesday that Johnson will likely face strong opposition within the House Republican Conference over the must-pass legislation, saying he expects the speaker will get “some” backlash. “I think a lot of people were very concerned about this FISA extension. I think that we don’t want to see it. I think that we’re expressing our concern to the speaker,” Gaetz said.Section 702 has become a cause celebre among conservative Republicans after revelations that a different section of the same law was inappropriately used to surveil Carter Page, an aide to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, and has intensified amid intense Republican distrust of the US intelligence community.US intelligence agencies reported earlier this year that the number of warrantless FBI searches of Americans’ electronic data under the controversial intelligence program dropped sharply from millions of searches in 2021 to over 100,000 last year. The report credited the drop to stronger safeguards that the FBI has put on analysts’ ability to search through the intelligence gathered through Section 702 authority.Johnson said in a dear colleague letter Thursday that he intends to bring bills to the floor next week from the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee so that the chamber can consider “reforms and extensions of authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, including the section 702 authorities.”The speaker said the bills will be brought to the floor under a special rule “that provides members a fair opportunity to vote in favor of their preferred measure.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell released a joint statement Thursday on FISA reform legislation.“Reforming FISA authorities to prevent abuse while ensuring our ability to defend our nation is a shared bipartisan, bicameral priority,” the statement said. “We commit to work in good faith with our Senate Chairs and Ranking Members and the House to negotiate a final bill that can be passed on a bipartisan basis by both the House and Senate early next year.”Johnson similarly noted in his letter that he has received commitments from Schumer and McConnell that the Senate “will work in good faith on a final reform bill that can be passed in both chambers.”Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said that leadership is trying to find a “fair process” for working out the differences on the House floor between the two different bills.“We don’t want to lose the reforms that came out of Judiciary and (Intelligence committees), but you obviously have got a difference between the two committees on a final piece, and that is on the warrants,” Scalise said. “That is going to have to get resolved on the House floor next week.”“Everybody has got different opinions on how to handle FISA,” Scalise said. “Each side is pushing very aggressively for their approach. These are Republican committees so that is something that our members are ultimately going to have to decide.”CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",5603,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/ndaa-fisa-extension/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180507170345-clare-foran-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,leadership minority lot record share opinion hill back conversation generate resolve intend backlash mcconnell critical side version american intensified major lose rank annual adversary ndaa described contribute agency strong raju argue rule abuse mike rabinowitz carter prolong procedure handle finger govern receive law put frustration allege sharply express amid told particularly cnn release critic senate push april reach bill wednesday defend colleague scalise clean reauthorization consider increasingly pushback temporarily aide prevent nation heat drop extend safeguard floor current louisiana legislation privacy set fisa hannah million variety republican talk observe commitment dear flare design celebre page candidate test concerned similarly speaker enables national obtain search credit opposition bring civil year stuffed controversial member act report intense warrantless difference leader mitch scrutiny person program fbi defense majority number florida negotiate fair section special revelation internal policy foreign joint expect favor concern early rimmer opportunity commit work inappropriately support liberty chair lawmaker extends analyst add different gop johnson data basis manu find overseas base chamber marjorie week prefer conference bicameral trump surveillance priority permit ability electronic note aggressively piece collect vote earlier judiciary process protect include grow loophole taylor engage gaetz tool point government give distrust ensure georgia thursday bipartisan capitol statement issue brought house office final authority extension conservative intelligence provide reform letter donald morgan ultimately steve matt greene oppose faith chuck warrant compromise proper approach communication gather security surveil schumer pass authorization committee,0.99135,0.21417097983223274,12.060547112462007,0.509143870314083,0
CNN,Desperate families of Israeli-American hostages plead with White House to get creative for loved ones’ release,2023-12-07 16:56:00,MJ Lee,"For some of the family members of the Israeli-Americans that Hamas is believed to have taken hostage, evenings can feel especially excruciating.Ruby Chen, whose 19-year-old reservist son Itay, has been missing since October 7, recently spoke with CNN just before midnight in Israel. “This is the most difficult part of the day,” Chen said, because that is when he finally lets himself pause long enough to wonder: “How productive have I been in moving the release of my son an inch?”For Iris Haggai Liniado, whose parents are believed to have been kidnapped by Hamas two months ago while they were on their morning walk, every meal can serve as a painful reminder of how little she knows about her mother and father’s whereabouts. “Today I sat and ate dinner with my sister,” Haggai Liniado told CNN one evening this week. “I’m having this huge plate of food – and my mom is not eating at all. Or maybe eating rice. Or maybe not even alive.”Not knowing whether her parents, Judih and Gadi Weinstein-Haggai, are even still alive – and if they are, how much suffering they may be enduring – has been torture, she said. “I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemies. I wouldn’t wish this on Hamas who did all these things.”Chen and Haggai Liniado are now among the families of the American hostages desperately calling on the Israeli government and the Biden White House, to do something – anything – to get their family members out of Hamas captivity.The release of multiple Israeli-Russian hostages as part of a separate deal that Russian President Vladimir Putin struck with Hamas has left an impression on the families of the American hostages. Even as they recognize the unique circumstances that appear to have made the release of Russian nationals possible – chiefly, Putin has been accused of supporting Hamas – the families are increasingly wondering whether any kind of arrangement that secures the release of just the American citizens might be possible.“President Putin kind of opened our eyes that there is the ability to do a separate deal on a specific nationality,” Chen said. “So that precedent is something that I think is logical to suggest or to consider.”Haggai Liniado echoed that sentiment, even as she, too, acknowledged the reality of Moscow’s ties to Hamas. “If the Russians had it done,” she said, “there just has to be a way. Somehow.”Chen was also among the families of hostages that met with Vice President Kamala Harris’ national security adviser Phil Gordon in Israel on Wednesday. Some of the families, according to Chen, pressed Gordon on the idea of the Biden administration crafting a hostages deal with Qatar – which has served as the main interlocutor in negotiations with Hamas – without the Israeli government’s initial involvement.“Sometimes you have kids arguing – and need adults to get involved,” Chen said. Gordon appeared receptive, he said.There are still seven American men and one woman missing since the war began, according to the White House. Four Americans – a four-year-old girl and three women – have been released so far.As the war enters its third month, the families of those missing Americans have become something of a support system for one another. They have an active WhatsApp group chat, where they share information about the war and the hostages – and discuss next possible steps.The families CNN spoke with said they are appreciative of the White House’s engagement with the families so far – but the reality that American citizens are still missing has been a tough pill to swallow.“As a US citizen, I ask myself – what is my US government doing?” Chen said.“I do expect the American government to definitely bring all the eight Americans back. I believe that’s their duty,” Haggai Liniado said.The families spoke with President Joe Biden via Zoom one week after the October 7 attack, and since then, there has been consistent outreach from the White House and the office of Biden’s hostage envoy, Roger Carstens, according to the families.That is a stark contrast, they said, to the minimal outreach and support they have received from the Israeli government, which has come under intense criticism from released hostages and their families. Leaked audio recordings of a meeting between freed Israeli hostages, the relatives of those still being held and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet this week captured their fierce anger and frustration.Last Thursday, the families of the unaccounted for Americans again spoke with Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. Sullivan himself described the conversation afterwards as “heart-wrenching.”Shortly after that meeting with Sullivan, things took a turn.For seven days, Hamas had been releasing a small group of Israeli women and children hostages each day, as part of an agreement with Israel to temporarily pause the fighting. But on day seven, after Hamas refused to release any more of the kidnapped women and Israel, in turn, rejected Hamas’ demands to move on to the next category of hostages – men – Israel’s military operation swiftly resumed.The halt of the daily release of hostages was a gut punch for the families, some of whom had begun to hope that their loved ones could soon be getting out.Jon Polin’s 23-year-old son, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, is believed to have been taken from the Nova music festival on October 7. Polin told CNN that the end of the truce prompted a “night and day difference in all of our thinking.”“We went from optimism to a level of despair,” he said.The formal hostage negotiations that had been taking place in Doha, Qatar, officially disbanded last week. Senior US officials said the administration continues to be in close contact with their Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian counterparts about ways to get more hostages out, but the seeming lack of progress on that front is fueling the families’ growing anxiety.“I wish that I were hearing more creativity coming out of everybody involved – the administration, the Israelis, Hamas, Qatar, Egypt,” said Polin, even as he emphasized that he doesn’t question the White House’s dedication to the mission and said he has received “tremendous support” from the administration. “I just feel like there’s not a lot I’m hearing that’s creative thinking.”Describing the past few days as an “inflection point,” Chen said the Biden administration must “reevaluate some of the working assumptions that the US has.”Many of the families have been unsparing in their criticism of the Red Cross. Despite the truce agreement stipulating that Red Cross officials would be allowed to visit hostages in Gaza by the end of Day Four of the pause in fighting, more than a week later, that has yet to happen. As a result, there has been barely any new information about the whereabouts or conditions of the missing Americans – including whether some of them are alive.“The question came up on the call: What could the US do to further pressure ICRC action?” Polin said about the families’ meeting with Sullivan last week. “It was a point of frustration for him.”Asked why the Red Cross has not been able to go into Gaza yet to check on the hostages, White House spokesman John Kirby told CNN Wednesday that “the blame has to be laid at Hamas’ feet.”“Hamas has not allowed Red Cross in to visit the hostages as they agreed to do. And it’s unacceptable,” Kirby said. “If we could get Red Cross access to them, not only would they have a measure of solace – which is the most important thing that somebody knows where they are and cares about their condition – but it would help give us some information.”For now, Chen, Polin and Haggai Liniado are holding on to the very last WhatsApp messages they received from their sons and parents before everything went dark.Chen’s son, Itay, texted at 6:45 a.m. that his military base was under missile attack.

And the investors who handed out billions of dollars to fund them aren’t very happy about it.During more flush years, venture capitalists, angel investors and billionaire evangelists poured their cash into tech startups – the easy money pipe was seemingly open to any Tom, Dick or Harry who had an idea and was willing to attach a buzzy phrase like ‘blockchain’ or ‘AI’ to it. Valuations soared and unicorn companies, those startups said to be worth $1 billion or more, proliferated.But now, with high interest rates, an uncertain economic environment and a banking crisis that hit Silicon Valley-adjacent banks hard, there’s been a shortage of funds for early-stage companies and a lack of opportunity for late-stage companies to cash out.For investors looking to maximize their money, better opportunities exist elsewhere.In this environment, money sitting in less risky money markets tends to pay better than high-risk startups. The Bloomberg US Aggregate bond index, a widely-tracked benchmark for the performance of US investment-grade bonds, logged a 4.5% return in November. That’s the index’s best monthly performance since 1985.The risks are high with a startup. Sure, tech titans like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are doing just fine – but their younger siblings are struggling to stay afloat.So, why would a potential investor stick their neck out for a tech startup when they can get paid to sit on cash instead?Venture capital funding for startups across the globe has fallen by more than half since last year, according to new Pitchbook data – the annual fundraising figure for 2023 is pacing towards its lowest level since 2015.With a lack of both funds and exit opportunities (that’s when shareholders are able to cash out by selling a bunch of stock through an acquisition, IPO, buyout or merger), early stage companies are unable to get started and late stage companies are falling into distress. When a company is private, opportunities to sell shares tend to be fewer and farther between.So far this year, nearly 20% of all startups have raised money at a lower valuation than they had previously, according to equity management company Carta. That’s up from 5% in 2021.More startups have shut down in the third quarter of 2023 since Carta began tracking the data almost five years ago. So far this year, 543 startups on Carta’s platform have shuttered.The carnage is so bad that some insiders are calling this an extinction-level event for startups.Some of these firms had previously raised a lot of money. Big names like WeWork, which raised $11 billion in funding, and freight startup Convoy which brought in $900 million, have both filed for bankruptcy in the past two months.Other companies are still holding out, but they’re at a standstill while shareholders hope they can ride out the storm and cash out at a later time. Through the first half of the year 2023, people received about $12 billion from 588 separate corporate exits. The full-year figure is now on track to come in as the lowest of the decade, according to the report.“An immense amount of capital remains trapped in late-stage and venture-growth-stage startups hesitant to gamble on whether their financial performance can withstand the intense scrutiny of the public markets,” found a PitchBook report.What comes next: Venture capitalists are sitting on a record amount of “dry powder” (that’s capital that’s been committed but still waiting to be invested) according to PitchBook.And while startup funding and exit strategies may remain tight for the next year, analysts say that there are some promising signs ahead.AI and biotech funding still remain relatively strong, wrote Allan Parks, manager at private equity platform Allvue, in a recent note. Initial public offerings are slowly picking back up and the venture scene in Europe is “witnessing some promising fundraising activity,” he added.Still, he said, “for venture capital managers and investors, 2023 was a wild ride – and not necessarily in a good way,”",4058,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/investing/2023-was-an-extinction-level-year-for-tech-startups-where-did-all-the-money-go/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1368649213.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,farther funding biotech raise lot fall november quarter share index record hesitant cash return back maximize public angel distress remains amount track half firm silicon annual economic flush benchmark strong slowly ride withstand startup shortage valuation gamble company phrase banking open struggle start receive allan storm write decade level unable shareholder happy remain wework wait dick file risky tom attach neck financial allvue stock begin accord equity fundraise globe platform alphabet event dry witness potential capital ipo acquisition late past bond stage corporate private figure million pace sign scene idea young market bank unicorn ago immense soar exist pick performance uncertain year hard lack blockchain tech found intense billionaire sibling buyout relatively scrutiny amazon interest carta bunch rate dollar bankruptcy titan bloomberg stay europe shut hand merger sell monthly insider crisis early instead opportunity paid recent pitchbook commit tight analyst investor environment data park easy microsoft standstill promising pipe risk convoy powder low worth freight evangelist manager high buzzy big carnage note pay aggregate wild fund activity stick previously money venture management hold time capitalist brought hit invest initial tend seemingly harry exit apple fine offering hope strategy necessarily separate billion call trap,0.031950000000000034,0.22178413011335632,10.193165562913904,0.4010270505508601,0
CNN,Meta’s Oversight Board to weigh in on company’s handling of Israel-Hamas war content,2023-12-07 16:16:00,Clare Duffy,"Meta’s Oversight Board on Thursday initiated a review of two content moderation decisions by the social media giant related to Israel-Hamas war content.The move marks the first time the board has conducted an “expedited” review process, a nod to the intense scrutiny Facebook-parent Meta and other social media companies have faced over content related to the conflict. The board decided to take up a faster review in this case because content decisions related to the war could have “urgent real-world consequences,” it said in a statement.In the weeks following Hamas’ attack on Israel, major social media platforms faced questions about whether they were hosting misleading and hateful content related to the conflict. European Union officials sent warnings to TikTok, Meta, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter), raising concerns about war-related content on their platforms and reminding the social media companies they could face billions of dollars in fines if an investigation later determines they violated EU content moderation laws. US and UK lawmakers also called on the platforms to ensure they were enforcing their rules against hateful and illegal content.Meta told CNN in October that it had established “a special operations center staffed with experts, including fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers, to closely monitor and respond to this rapidly evolving situation,” and that it was coordinating with third-party fact checkers in the region.In the weeks after the Israel-Hamas conflict broke out, Meta’s Oversight Board said it saw a nearly three-fold increase in daily average user appeals of decisions on content “related to the Middle East and North Africa region.”Meta’s Oversight Board is an entity made up of experts in areas such as freedom of expression and human rights. It is often described as a kind of Supreme Court for Meta, as it allows users to appeal content decisions on the company’s platforms. The board makes recommendations to the company about how to handle certain content moderation decisions, as well as broader policy suggestions.The Oversight Board plans to review one video that appears to show the aftermath of a strike outside the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City posted to Instagram in early November, which “shows people, including children, injured or dead, lying on the ground and/or crying.” A caption under the video in Arabic and English referenced the Israeli army, stating that the hospital had been “targeted by the ‘usurping occupation.’”Meta initially removed the post for violating its rules on graphic and violent content. A user appealed the decision, asking for the video to be restored, after the board decided to take up the case, Meta made the video viewable with a warning that the content is disturbing.The board will also review a video that shows two hostages being kidnapped by Hamas militants — a woman on a motorbike and a man being marched away — in which the caption urges people to watch to gain a “deeper understanding” of the October 7 attack on Israel.Meta initially removed the post for violating two policies: its rules against violence and incitement, which were temporarily revised to include content that clearly identified hostages, and its dangerous organizations and individuals policy that prohibits imagery of terror attacks on visible victims. (Meta designates Hamas as a dangerous organization under its policy and labeled the October 7 attack as a terrorist attack.) The company later reinstated the video with a warning screen “in response to trends in how hostage kidnapping videos were being shared and reported on.”The board expects to render a decision on the cases within the next 30 days.Meta said in a blog post Thursday that the board’s “guidance in these cases, along with feedback from other experts, will help us to continue to evolve our policies and response to the ongoing Israel-Hamas War.” It added that it plans to implement the board’s decision in each case.",3963,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/tech/meta-oversight-board-israel-hamas-content/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230120140132-clare-duffy.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,european user initially raise army respond increase response november share investigation ongoing militant continue broke coordinate urge mislead imagery motorbike revise kind expert feedback monitor major arabic prohibits illegal described tiktok appeal warn hostage moderation rule content africa youtube handle company incitement law review told cnn formerly evolve child faster aftermath medium trend strike move warning temporarily meta platform establish entity video gaza october broader board violence closely injured operation blog conduct usurp north twitter kidnap israeli center reference speaker expedite understand post dead follow away related report intense official recommendation determines scrutiny middle victim social dollar case dangerous average attack label enforce make special court instagram hamas city policy violate caption restore graphic expect guidance concern early supreme uk remind plan x expression situation viewable terrorist israel mark giant implement fluent staffed lawmaker question reinstate add hateful ground week fact state consequence visible remove host union decision identify decide process deeper include nod oversight hospital screen rapidly ensure woman individual english render thursday time checker urgent violent target kidnapping show terror watch fine east daily hebrew designates freedom conflict march human billion call lie area organization initiate,-0.98655,0.3785011355034065,11.573597733711047,0.3392316017316018,0
CNN,"CDC urges doctors, health departments to bolster surveillance of more severe mpox strain",2023-12-07 16:01:00,Amanda Musa,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged doctors and health departments Thursday to be on the lookout for a more infectious strain of the virus that causes mpox, which is spreading in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The agency has also issued a Travel Health Notice urging people who go to DRC to minimize contact with others who are ill, to steer clear of wild animals and to refrain from eating or preparing wild game.The clade I monkeypox virus is more contagious and causes infections that are more severe than the clade II strain that was associated with the 2022-23 global outbreak, which has predominantly affected gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men, according to the CDC.A clade is a broad grouping of viruses that has evolved over decades and is a genetic and clinically distinct group. Mpox is characterized by two distinct genetic clades.No cases of clade I have been reported in the United States, the CDC stressed, but that strain is being spread through sexually associated human-to-human contact in DRC.“Clinicians should continue to consider mpox when evaluating the cause of rashes,” the CDC said, noting that infection can look different from person to person.“Mpox lesions may be small, firm and rubbery, deep-seated, and well-circumscribed, or they may be large, with diffuse, centrifugal lesion distribution,” the agency says.Doctors should further investigate for mpox if a patient has swollen lymph nodes or has traveled to DRC within 21 days of illness. Public health officials are also being advised to enhance surveillance through testing should the strain be detected in the United States.“Specimens collected from patients who traveled to DRC should be sent to CDC as expeditiously as possible,” the agency said in a news release. Laboratories should alert their state health department and the CDC if someone tests positive for clade I mpox.Since January, DRC has reported more than 12,500 clinically diagnosed but not laboratory-confirmed mpox cases and nearly 600 suspected deaths from the virus, according to the agency.“This is a substantial increase from the median 3,767 suspected mpox cases reported annually in DRC during the years 2016-2021,” the CDC said.More than 31,000 Americans were diagnosed with mpox in the 2022-23 outbreak, including 55 who died, according to CDC data.There is a vaccine for mpox called Jynneos, but the CDC notes that vaccination coverage in the US is low because only 1 in 4 people who are eligible to get it have received both doses required for full protection.According to the CDC, people at high risk for mpox include gay and bisexual men, other men who have sex with men, and transgender and nonbinary people who in the past six months have had at least one of the following: a new diagnosis of at least one sexually transmitted disease, more than one sex partner, sex at a commercial sex venue or in conjunction with a large public event in an area where mpox is spreading, sexual partners of people who have those risks and people who plan to participate in any of the previous activities.",3100,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/health/cdc-mpox-advisory/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207111343-cdc-headquarters-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,lymph mpox increase person associate case rash continue public specimen urge expeditiously strain broad patient diagnose american advise clinically possible firm large commercial doctor agency centrifugal illness vaccine plan substantial united full disease transmit venue previous month virus cdc receive different alert drc stress day group diffuse death monkeypox vaccination eligible decade swollen democratic release evolve conjunction clade refrain state participate suspect surveillance risk travel steer nonbinary low minimize sexually control global prevention positive animal department high partner consider infectious note contact accord collect enhance outbreak include event annually lesion gay wild past republic lookout small activity eat contagious laboratory rubbery affected characterize coverage severe distinct health notice transgender bisexual prepare thursday spread issue distribution test news node center predominantly median require jynneos sexual year sex detect genetic follow investigate infection report diagnosis clear call january clinician evaluate official area,-0.84885,0.1935483870967742,11.377697841726615,0.452610544217687,0
CNN,CPSC issues several warnings for tiny magnetic balls after seven deaths,2023-12-07 15:29:00,Ramishah Maruf,"The US Consumer Product Safety Commission issued several warnings for high-powered magnetic balls in toy sets, after the agency said it was aware of seven deaths linked to swallowing small magnets.The CPSC did not list the total units affected because most of the companies did not agree to recall their products. However, if the companies do not agree to a voluntary recall, the CPSC could sue or begin a mandatory recall process.These magnets are small enough to fit into the CPSC’s small parts cylinder (which simulates the width of a child’s throat), and are also magnetically stronger than permitted. And when people swallow these high-powered magnets, they can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.”The agency estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021. Of the seven deaths, two were outside of the United States.However, the agency issued one recall on Thursday from XpressGoods’ colorful metal magnetic balls, which affected about 728 units. The CPSC said consumers should immediately stop using those magnets, which are 5mm in diameter (.04 of an inch), and contact XpressGoods for a prepaid label to return for a full refund or store credit.There are six other warnings for high-powered magnets. Four of the warnings are for magnet sets sold exclusively on Temu, a wide-ranging marketplace. These sets include Allvre’s 216-Piece 5mm Magnetic Ball Sets, Sunny House’s 125-Piece 5mm Mixed Color Magnetic Ball Sets, Ming Tai Trade’s 216-Piece 5mm Magnetic Ball Sets and Magic QQ’s 216-Piece Mixed Color Magnetic Ball Sets.The CPSC said it reached out to all of these manufacturers, but most of the firms have not agreed to recall or offer a remedy to customers. All of these magnets were sold online this year.A magnetic ball set sold at South Korean site myKmarket.com was also issued a warning.Most of these magnetics are colorful, and sold in a clear plastic case.

As part of the 3-year deal, Rahm will have an ownership stake in a new LIV Golf team, according to ESPN, citing unnamed sources.“It’s not an easy decision because I’ve had a really successful career and I’ve been really happy,” Rahm said in an interview with Fox News.“But there’s a lot of things that LIV Golf has to offer that were very, very enticing, starting with team golf. Being part of a team is something that’s been really big for me throughout my career. I was part of the Spanish national team from the age of 14 until I graduated college. I was part of the Arizona State golf team. As a pro, you don’t have that chance very often. … It’s something that is very fun to play for something more than just yourself.“And simply, the growth that LIV Golf has brought to the game of golf. It’s something fresh. It’s something new. It’s something with a ton of potential and opportunity.

The money is great. Obviously, it’s wonderful,” Rahm said on the financial aspect of the deal. “But what I said before is true: I do not play golf for the money. I play golf for the love of the game and for the love of golf. But as a husband, as a father and as a family man, I have a duty to my family to give them the best opportunities and the most amount of resources possible.”Rahm’s move to the Saudi-backed professional golf tour comes during a pivotal month for both the PGA Tour and LIV.

CNN,Biden open to policy changes on the border as his push for Ukraine funding stalls,2023-12-07 15:19:00,Michael Williams,"President Joe Biden is sending a clear message to Democratic negotiators on Capitol Hill that he is open to striking a compromise with Republicans on border security in order to get talks on funding for Ukraine back on track.During his impassioned speech in the White House’s Roosevelt Room on Wednesday, Biden said he felt Republicans haven’t been willing to make a deal, though some have since expressed optimism about the direction of negotiations.“I am willing to make significant compromises on the border. We need to fix the broken border system, it is broken. And thus far, I’ve gotten no response,” he said as he made a fresh appeal to lawmakers, adding that failure to reach a compromise would serve as a “gift” for Russian President Vladimir Putin.But, he added, “This has to be a negotiation.”“Republicans think they can get everything they want without any bipartisan compromise,” the president said. “That’s not the answer. … And now they’re willing to literally kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield and damage our national security in the process.”If struck, a deal could end a stalemate that the president said imperils the future of Ukraine’s sovereignty and democracy around the world, while also upheaving US immigration policy, which has served as an intractable issue in Congress for decades.Acknowledging the country’s immigration system is “broken,” Biden made direct overtures toward Republicans who want policy changes along the border, saying he is willing to do “significantly more” than he has already proposed. He also signaled an openness to changing policy – but was vague on what exact policy changes he would consider.Some of the changes that the White House has expressed openness to are reminiscent of the Trump-era that previously received fierce pushback from advocate, according to three sources familiar with the discussions.Sources tell CNN the changes the White House telegraphed to the Hill included, for example, raising the credible fear standard for migrants seeking asylum, which could have the effect of making fewer migrants eligible for asylum. They also were open to casting a wider net of undocumented immigrants subject to the fast-track deportation procedure known as “expedited removal,” which the Trump administration tried to do and would give greater latitude in quickly deporting undocumented immigrants.One of Biden’s close Democratic allies said it could be time for the president to become personally involved in negotiations if current talks fail, with Sen. Chris Coons saying president should bring negotiators together.“I think we need one more weekend of passing paper back and forth between those core group of engaged senators,” the Delaware Democrat told CNN. “President Biden was a senator himself for 36 years. I think he respects and understands the importance of letting the Senate work if it can, and if it really can’t, then pulling everyone.”But, he warned, “we are running out of time.”“No one has shown they are more able at crafting and passing a bipartisan compromise than Senator Biden. So, frankly, he would contribute well to this,” Coons added.Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has a history of working across the aisle, said she thinks it’s time the White House gets more involved in negotiations.“I think we’re at a point where if we’re going to get something done those that ultimately give that final say so need to be engaged in it,” she told CNN.Other Republicans, including leading negotiator Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, had accused Biden and Democrats of “throwing more money at this problem” instead of seeking a real solution. In addition to about $60 billion in economic and military aid to Ukraine, Biden’s $106 billion supplemental request already allocates $14 billion for border security. Billions more would go toward Israel and Taiwan.It appears that some progress has been made among lawmakers, even after Senate Republicans scuttled the supplemental funding bill for Ukraine on Wednesday night.“I think we’re pretty close to it,” said Rep. Tony Gonzales, whose Texas district includes 823 miles of the US-Mexico border.Gonzales told CNN he wants to see more concessions from Democrats in border policy negotiations, but expressed optimism over the direction of talks.“There needs to be more,” Gonzales said when asked about the proposals the White House has floated. He said he wanted the Biden administration to carry out more deportation flights instead of focusing funds on soft-sided facilities that have been used for processing the influx of migrants.Still, Gonzales described talks as “close.” He’s been in touch with Lankford, as well as other leading negotiators.“We just have to have the administration realize that they have a problem,” Gonzales said.“That problem is growing. That problem is expanding. And the problem is also solvable.”But the situation on the Hill has led the White House to back off its confidence that Ukraine funding can get done in time.Pressed by CNN’s MJ Lee during Thursday’s White House press briefing on whether or not the White House could offer Ukraine any assurances that additional funding is headed their way, White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby said, “We are not in a position to make that promise to Ukraine, given where things are on the Hill.”The comments marked a stark departure from the confidence the administration has previously signaled about Congress’ ability to pass additional aid to Ukraine as it fights Russia’s invasion – during a briefing just last month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters he “continue[s] to remain confident that, while this has been a winding road since we began the effort to secure additional funding for Ukraine, that there is a strong bipartisan majority in both houses to do it and we will ultimately get it done.”",5882,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/biden-compromise-border-security/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230627140919-priscilla-alvarez-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country funding significantly raise negotiator vague send broken response change respect hill back kirby frankly importance continue russia pull intractable immigrant russian request strategic promise addition overture touch facility core concession close economic described contribute scuttle warn appeal gonzales strong personally murkowski effort procedure asylum deportation offer system open effect receive deal damage express adviser senator told democratic cnn remain senate tony lisa reach expand room bill wednesday cast fix reminiscent pretty biden realize carry strike head credible reporter begin pushback processing accord john texas paper lankford departure military influx history net current significant answer telegraph james imperils republican talk congress advocate border national fight accuse confident deport undocumented press vladimir bring year expedite stalemate assurance direct delaware impassioned passing negotiation clear felt coon quickly struck speech majority removal lee make flight optimism ally fail aid policy administration sullivan oklahoma jake instead fresh direction road understands supplemental roosevelt weekend fear secure situation work israel chris president month lawmaker add progress allocates comment group message eligible signal sovereignty failure lead stark proposal trump mj serve seek ability democracy aisle confidence focus position future latitude include marked grow fund throw run engage council real point previously give money world solution fierce involve order time bipartisan thursday capitol familiar joe subject issue additional upheave gift house final immigration openness coordinator float standard problem show invasion ultimately propose craft exact migrant compromise wider source mile ukraine white literally kneecap wind communication battlefield billion district security great briefing democrat,0.9865999999999999,0.05100306018361102,10.428618481244282,0.40469483568075126,0
CNN,"Who is Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader Israel has called a ‘dead man walking’",2023-12-07 14:38:00,Ivana Kottasová,"The Israeli prime minister said Wednesday that Israeli forces had surrounded the house of Yahya Sinwar, potentially closing in on the top Hamas official in Gaza – and the man most wanted by Israeli authorities.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sinwar was not in the house and was believed to be hiding underground in Gaza, but a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that it was “only a matter of time before we get him.”Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ terror attack against Israel on October 7 – though experts say he is likely one of several – making him one of the key targets of its war in Gaza.A longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas’ military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group’s civilian and political leader.He was elected to Hamas’ main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza branch. However, he has since become the Politburo’s de facto leader, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).He has been designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State since 2015, and has been recently sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France.Harel Chorev, senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that while Sinwar is a key player within Hamas, he shouldn’t be seen as its sole leader.“He is perceived as the most senior one because he has a very high public profile, but Hamas doesn’t work this way,” he said. “Hamas is a decentralized organization with several separate power centers and he is one of them.”Chorev said that while Sinwar is a prominent figure, he is one of a “triumvirate” of Hamas officials responsible for the October 7 attack, along with Mohammed al-Masri, popularly known as Mohammed Deif, the commander of the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of Hamas, and Deif’s deputy, Marwan Issa.Sinwar, with his silver head of hair and dark eyes set deep under prominent eyebrows, is by far the best known and most recognizable of the three, but it was Deif who announced the October 7 attacks.But while Sinwar has spent the past few years giving speeches and being photographed, Deif is an extremely secretive, shadowy figure who hasn’t been seen in public in decades.Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. His family was displaced from Al-Majdal, a Palestinian village in modern day Askhelon, during the Arab-Israeli war.He joined Hamas in the late 1980s and became one of the founders of its feared internal intelligence apparatus, known as the Majd.He was convicted in 1988 of playing a role in the murder of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians suspected of collaboration with Israel, and spent more than two decades in Israeli prison.Sinwar later said he had spent those years studying his enemy, including learning to speak Hebrew.He was released in 2011 as part of the deal that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Gilad Shalit, an IDF soldier who had been captured and taken to Gaza, where he was held for more than five years.At that time, Sinwar called the exchange “one of the big strategic monuments in the history of our cause.”Chorev said his release was helped by the fact that his brother was one of Shalit’s kidnappers and insisted on him being included in the deal.Back in Gaza, Sinwar has risen through the ranks and quickly became a key player within Hamas. Chorev said he became known for his brutality and the violence he inflicts on anyone he suspects of betrayal or collaboration.“It is well known that while in prison, he tortured people, mostly members of Hamas, using (a) hot plate to cause them burns… his role in the Majd really tells you a lot about his character, his cruelty. But at the same time, Israelis who met him said that he can also be very practical, openly discussing options,” Chorev said.As the political leader of Hamas, Sinwar focused on the group’s foreign relationships. According to the ECFR, he was responsible for restoring Hamas’ relationship with Egyptian leaders who were wary of the group’s support for political Islam, and for pulling in continued military funding from Iran.Sinwar was considered a vital decisionmaker and likely the main point of contact within Gaza during the intense negotiations over the return of the more than 240 hostages taken into the enclave by Hamas in the October 7 attacks. The talks involved senior figures from Israel, Hamas, the United States, Qatar and Egypt.“At the end of the day there are two people” atop the negotiations, said Gershon Baskin, a well-known Israeli peace activist involved in the 2011 release of Shalit, the Israeli soldier. “One is Yahya Sinwar on the Hamas side, and the other is Benjamin Netanyahu on the Israeli side.”More than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages were released by Hamas and 240 Palestinian prisoners and detainees released by Israel as part of a truce won in those talks, before the temporary ceasefire collapsed on December 1, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for the failure.Sinwar has been called many things over the past two months: Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht called Sinwar the “face of evil” and declared him a “dead man walking.” Israeli media compared him to Osama bin Laden, while a profile published by the IDF nicknamed him “the Butcher from Khan Younis.”But Chorev said that despite his position in the spotlight, Sinwar is just one of many commanders Israel needs to remove before it can say it has “destroyed Hamas.”“To put it simply, if Israel will kill Sinwar, it doesn’t mean necessarily that it will topple down Hamas. However, Hamas can still be toppled down even if Sinwar stays alive … because it’s not (a hierarchical orgnization). In order for Israel to destroy Hamas, it needs to destroy a critical mass of power centers, not just him,” he said.",6036,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-profile-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230814170035-ivana-kottasova-profile-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,european player funding khan born enclave spotlight lot top aviv islamist insist return shadowy public pull askhelon strategic mass netanyahu critical relationship side expert refugee continued rank islam deif truce popularly power body branch ceasefire temporary senior compare hostage mohammed prisoner deputy monument brother matter relation put deal ecfr day adviser responsible study decade key brigade release learn yahya african displace suspect wednesday medium decisionmaker global risen dark department head consider contact accord prime wary military late eastern past role political history gaza southern october violence designate facto modern set plate figure university spokesman tel underground hair talk play dayan simply israeli peace gershon center accuse closing year publish shalit spent detainee declare dead palestinian regional hierarchical member held recognizable marwan intense negotiation december collaboration extremely official leader middle despite triumvirate quickly perceive village speech idf character qatar defense kill attack atop force make camp stay founder forge sole internal hamas exchange foreign alive eye chorev restore wing hot tie egyptian united family fear believe butcher work brutality terrorist israel recently option discuss support destroyed destroy hecht month apparatus convict younis profile minister part publicly group osama prison benjamin arab research evil building surround inflicts hiding fact state mastermind topple remove join elect enemy high richard civilian big betrayal decentralize cruelty speak focus photograph position soldier researcher include torture important council kidnapper point vital give laden kingdom blame murder announce involve time order collapse house moshe deep baskin target intelligence secretive potentially sanction prominent terror politburo gilad commander practical arm orgnization necessarily capture separate nickname openly longtime silver call sinwar organization eyebrow activist,-0.9952000000000001,0.2485089463220676,9.46126188418323,0.41325141229928475,0
CNN,Candidate for George Santos’ old seat convicted for his actions in January 6 Capitol attack,2023-12-07 14:32:00,,"A New York man who filed to run for ousted Rep. George Santos’ seat in the House of Representatives was found guilty of several charges stemming from the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.A federal grand jury found Philip Sean Grillo guilty earlier this week of a total five charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding, a felony.Grillo entered the Capitol building on January 6 through a broken window carrying a megaphone and said once inside that he was there to “stop the steal,” according to the Justice Department.“It’s our f- house!” he exclaimed before making his way further into the building, where he filmed himself smoking marijuana and saying, “We f- did it, you understand? We stormed the Capitol,” according to the Justice Department.YouTube footage from that day showed Grillo in a crowd that chanted “Fight for Trump!” while physically confronting law enforcement officers, according to court filings. He entered and exited the Capitol building several times, the Justice Department said.The FBI identified Grillo using footage of the Capitol attack that showed him in a jacket embroidered with the seal of the Knights of Columbus chapter to which Grillo belonged, according to court documents.The Justice Department noted that during the trial, the 49-year-old testified he had “no idea” Congress met inside the Capitol building – yet he also said he was running for congressional office in New York’s 3rd Congressional District, previously represented by Santos.Earlier this month, Santos became the sixth lawmaker ever to be expelled from Congress after a scathing House Ethics Committee report concluded he “sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.”Grillo filed to run for the seat in May, according to the Federal Election Commission. His statement of candidacy is still listed by the FEC.On Tuesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a special election to fill Santos’ seat will be held on February 13.A date has yet to be set for Grillo’s sentencing.",2062,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/candidate-for-george-santos-old-seat-convicted-for-his-actions-in-january-6-capitol-attack/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-philip-sean-grillo-7.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,inside belong oust scathing knight steal enter embroider jury columbus broken chant grillo confront justice fbi obstruction seat guilty attack sought make seal special trial charge stop proceed court officer sentence jacket stem enforcement hochul ethic tuesday month lawmaker represent date sixth megaphone law day philip kathy storm candidacy building congressional week gov personal trump conclude file total identify financial film department representative carry expel window note accord york earlier federal include aspect run crowd previously commission exclaim footage set february fraudulently announce george time idea capitol congress marijuana statement smoking house exploit office show testify exit fight filing election list understand fill committee physically held santos district report found chapter january grand official,-0.67345,0.0,10.994453333333333,0.4847294372294373,0
CNN,"Russian propagandists exploited celebrity Cameo videos to spread disinformation, Microsoft says",2023-12-07 14:31:00,Catherine Thorbecke,"Russian propagandists exploited celebrity videos from the popular platform Cameo to support their misinformation campaigns, cybersecurity researchers at Microsoft said.Starting in July, pro-Russia social media channels began circulating videos of American celebrities that were “deceptively edited to push anti-Ukraine propaganda,” according to a report published Thursday by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center. The report said an unknown Russia-aligned influence actor leveraged Cameo, the popular website where people can pay public figures for personalized video messages, to obtain these videos of celebrities, including actor Elijah Wood and boxer Mike Tyson.The celebrities were apparently unaware that these videos were then edited in ways that appeared to attack Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.“The short video messages, which often feature celebrities pleading with ‘Vladimir’ to seek help for substance abuse, are edited by the unknown actor to include emojis and links,” according to the report. The videos were shared widely by pro-Russian social media accounts, and then were further amplified by state-backed Russian media outlets, the report said, where they were inaccurately portrayed as messages appealing directly to President Zelensky.Russia’s US embassy did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.The Microsoft researchers said they observed at least seven of these type of manipulated celebrity video messages being used since late July 2023. In addition to Wood and Tyson, videos featured other US celebrities such as Priscilla Presley, and actors Dean Norris, Kate Flannery and John McGinley. The celebrities named in the report did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.The videos were edited in some cases to make it look like they were interviews with news outlets or from a celebrity’s own social media account – and part of broader pleas to Zelensky to get help for a supposed substance abuse issue.“Kremlin officials and Russian state-sponsored propaganda have long promoted the false claim that President Zelensky struggles with substance abuse; however, this campaign marks a novel approach by pro-Russia actors seeking to further the narrative in the online information space,” the Microsoft researchers stated in the report.A Cameo spokesperson told CNN in a statement that the company does not publicly comment “on the details of its Trust & Safety investigations.” The spokesperson added, however, that these sort of videos “would violate Cameo’s Community Guidelines, and in cases where such violations are substantiated Cameo will typically take steps to remove the problematic content and suspend the purchaser’s account to help prevent further issues.”",2718,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/tech/cameo-celebrity-russia-propaganda-video/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230111170931-catherine-thorbecke.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,misinformation substantiate zelensky wood respond mcginley social share short case outlet elijah boxer public channel russian threat request attack addition make deceptively american long promote analysis july tyson suppose violate kremlin sort type feature influence popular appeal interview online content abuse mike flannery ukrainian mark support campaign embassy company directly president violation struggle add manipulate part comment publicly plea message microsoft told cnn emojis trust edit plead push state remove medium seek dean celebrity narrative begin suspend volodymyr kate accord researcher john pay information platform cameo include false prevent late video unaware space apparently personalize priscilla broader guideline leveraged account widely figure norris circulate thursday observe statement issue detail propagandist exploit propaganda news presley center safety website obtain link purchaser unknown vladimir immediately publish problematic claim inaccurately amplify step cybersecurity portrayed approach report spokesperson substance community typically actor official,-0.9319,0.0,14.145365853658536,0.36691919191919187,0
CNN,Meta rolls out encrypted messaging by default for Facebook and Messenger,2023-12-07 14:29:00,Brian Fung,"Users of Meta’s Facebook and Messenger apps will now automatically gain the protections of end-to-end encryption, a major boost to security and privacy, the company said Wednesday.The long-anticipated rollout will keep user messages from prying eyes by scrambling their contents to everyone but the intended senders and recipients. But the move could trigger renewed opposition by government officials who have warned that making messages harder for third parties to read might facilitate criminal activity.For years, Meta had been public about its plans to make encrypted messages the default mode for its messaging platforms. The company’s other messaging service, WhatsApp, defaulted to encrypted communications in 2016. That same year also saw Messenger enabling encrypted messaging on an opt-in basis.Meta doubled down on security and privacy technologies in 2019 as CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out a privacy-focused vision for Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram in response to rising scrutiny of platform manipulation issues and the company’s data practices. And in 2021, Instagram began testing opt-in end-to-end encrypted messaging.But it took a large-scale reworking of Messenger to support end-to-end encryption by default, Meta said Wednesday, explaining why the company took so long to follow through on extending default encryption to users of that platform.“This is the biggest set of improvements to Messenger since it was first launched in 2011,” wrote Loredana Crisan, head of Messenger, in a blog post, saying the company has “worked tirelessly to rebuild Messenger features from the ground up.”Under the new default settings, not even Meta will be able to see what users are sending to one another, Crisan said. The update not only brings Facebook and Messenger into line with WhatsApp but also with rival, non-Meta apps that offer similar levels of protection, including Signal and Apple’s iMessage.While messages will be “protected from the moment they leave your device to the moment they reach the receiver’s device,” Crisan added, there is one way in which encrypted messages could potentially be read by others: If a participant in a conversation reports a message to Meta.The expansion of end-to-end encryption could help protect political dissidents, human rights workers, journalists, minorities and others whom security experts say depend on encryption for their safety from authoritarian governments.Law enforcement officials, however, have long complained that Meta’s shift toward more privacy-protecting technologies could make it harder to investigate crimes.Meta clashed publicly with the Justice Department over encryption in 2019, when then-Attorney General William Barr called for the company to delay its companywide efforts to advance the technology.“By enabling dangerous criminals to cloak their communications and activities behind an essentially impenetrable digital shield, the deployment of warrant-proof encryption is already imposing huge costs on society,” Barr argued in a speech at Fordham University’s International Conference on Cyber Security that July.At the time, Meta responded that Barr’s call to clamp down on encryption would be a “gift to criminals, hackers and repressive regimes” who would exploit weak message security to prey on victims.Officials in the United Kingdom have been similarly critical of Meta’s plan. On Thursday, as news of Meta’s encryption defaults spread, UK Home Secretary James Cleverly told Politico that the decision “would empower child sex abusers and hamper the ability of the police and National Crime Agency to bring offenders to justice.”Law enforcement agencies have long called for tech companies to design ways that allow only authorized officials to access encrypted messaging. But technologists and security experts have said there is no technically feasible way to give “good guys” a tool that “bad guys” will not discover and use for themselves.",3938,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/tech/meta-rolls-out-encrypted-messaging-by-default-for-facebook-and-messenger/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1418603-0556-r-ps2560x1440.jpeg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police user clashed minority respond send depend response huge line conversation public intend participant critical setting expert major long feasible service ceo sender agency warn similar encrypt moment rebuild argue content leave enforcement loredana effort offer company companywide practice law zuckerberg write told level cost cloak child clamp crime reach renew offender wednesday digital explain department head automatically begin cleverly move impose meta platform brings worker political technology extend advance hamper privacy set james society secretary blog home university apps authoritarian receiver spread rollout international design politico exploit test trigger similarly facebook safety national opposition bring hacker year boost post fordham follow tech report encryption dissident official scrutiny deployment repressive pry messenger speech double crisan criminal justice dangerous party make essentially technically launch instagram expansion eye enable feature uk laid access plan united abuser journalist work mark support william add data publicly message signal improvement prey ground rival default conference vision delay shift ability update barr facilitate decision protection scramble big recipient tirelessly protect include empower rework general activity impenetrable tool government give kingdom device shield time thursday issue gift guy manipulation regime news technologist potentially cyber weak apple harder sex discover whatsapp human communication rise security read call authorize complain investigate,0.1958,0.228542407313357,13.447507507507506,0.4236576289207869,0

CNN,Trump wants election subversion case paused while he appeals judge’s ruling on presidential immunity,2023-12-07 17:33:00,Hannah Rabinowitz,"Donald Trump will appeal the decision by a federal judge in Washington, DC, to reject his attempts to dismiss the election subversion case against him.Trump’s attorneys also asked for the judge to pause all proceedings in the case until the appeal is resolved. They notified the court Thursday of his intent to appeal.Once they filed the notice, Trump’s attorneys wrote that the move “deprived this Court of jurisdiction over this case in its entirety pending resolution of the appeal.” They argued that a stay on further proceedings is “mandatory and automatic.”Various arguments that the case should be tossed failed at the trial court level. For instance, Trump’s attorneys have argued that, as president, Trump was immune from the criminal prosecution brought by special counsel Jack Smith. They say Trump’s alleged actions over the 2020 election results were part of his official duties at the time.His lawyers also argued that a president can only be indicted if he was convicted by the Senate during impeachment proceedings, which Trump was not.The question about presidential protections that Trump hopes to use as part of his defense will need to be settled before Trump goes to trial, which is currently scheduled for March 2024. It is also likely that any ruling by the appeals judges will be brought before the Supreme Court.“The Constitution protects Presidents in their work to make sure laws are followed, especially as it relates to elections,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement Thursday.“Consistent with binding Supreme Court case law, the unconstitutional prosecution must be stayed while President Trump appeals this vital issue.”Judge Tanya Chutkan, who will preside over Trump’s election interference trial in DC, refused to throw out the charges against the former president. In a ruling last week, Chutkan said that Trump does not enjoy absolute immunity for what he said and did after the 2020 election.“Whatever immunities a sitting President may enjoy, the United States has only one Chief Executive at a time, and that position does not confer a lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass,” Chutkan wrote in her ruling.She added that Trump’s “four-year service as Commander in Chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens.”This story has been updated with additional information.",2404,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/trump-wants-federal-election-case-put-on-hold-while-he-appeals-ruling-that-hes-not-immune/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220209160634-hannah-rabinowitz-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,impeachment bestow criminal case stayed defense pause dc argument ruling resolve settle jurisdiction immune judge make stay schedule special trial charge chief court fail enjoy intent service supreme appeal smith lawyer absolute refuse governs united argue work proceeding fellow campaign lifelong president steven convict question add attorney law jack part allege interference unconstitutional write prosecution presidential level immunity senate executive week subversion notify state trump file update decision protection story binding mandatory move position information federal king entirety pending throw vital chutkan confer constitution indict toss notice protects spokesman cheung relates thursday time action statement brought washington additional especially instance consistent evade accountability donald preside commander former election duty hope march follow divine attempt resolution result counsel reject currently dismiss deprive official,-0.050350000000000006,0.0,11.239815668202763,0.5505772005772006,0

Generative AI helps to imitate Stewart’s distinctive tone, replicated with the approval of the actor’s family and estate, managed by CMG Worldwide.Titled “It’s a Wonderful Sleep Story,” the bedtime tale kicks off on Christmas Eve, giving listeners a festive story as part of Calm’s Sleep Stories. The collection is meant to guide users to bed with calming voices and very few plot points, with Stewart’s story now available to premium Calm subscribers.“We are excited for our Dad to be the voice of Calm’s latest Sleep Story,” said Kelly Stewart Harcourt via a Calm statement to CNN. “It’s amazing what technology can do and wonderful to see Dad’s legacy live on this holiday season in new ways, like helping people find restful sleep and sweet dreams.”While the story itself was written and produced by Calm, the app worked with voice cloning company Respeecher to create a sound similar to Stewart. Respeecher, a Ukrainian-based AI voice company, says it relied on “a few dozen minutes” of existing recordings of the actor’s voice to train its system, blending that together with a voice actor reading the story out loud to create the finished version seemingly read by Stewart himself. Respeecher has also done projects recreating other iconic voices including Vince Lombardi, Luke Skywalker, and Darth Vader and announced a $1 million “pre-series A” fundraising round Wednesday.“Well, hello.

CNN,Former Twitter head of information security claims he was fired after raising concerns about cost cuts at Elon Musk’s company,2023-12-07 13:11:00,Clare Duffy,"The former head of information security at Twitter, now called X, is accusing the company of firing him after he objected to demands by owner Elon Musk and his associates to make cuts to safety systems.Shortly after Musk’s takeover of Twitter late last year, the billionaire’s leadership team demanded cuts to physical and digital security that threatened to put the company out of compliance with multiple regulatory requirements and posed a “danger to public safety,” according to the complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in New Jersey, on behalf of former Twitter Global Head of Information Security and Technology Alan Rosa.After Rosa raised concerns about the risks of such cuts, he alleges he was removed from one of his regular duties and then abruptly restricted from company systems and terminated “without notice” and having been given “no reason” for his firing.Rosa is accusing X of contract violations and unlawful termination. He initially attempted to handle the issue via private arbitration after having signed an arbitration clause, but X refused to engage, according to the complaint.A spokesperson for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Months before Musk took over Twitter, the company agreed to pay a $150 million penalty after the US government accused it of misleading consumers about how it protects their personal data, in violation of a 2011 privacy settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. Twitter also faced claims last year from a former executive-turned-whistleblower about alleged cybersecurity deficiencies and ongoing non-compliance with the 2011 FTC consent decree.Within days after Musk’s takeover in late October 2022, legal experts raised concerns that the company may have again violated its consent agreement with the FTC if it had failed to submit a required compliance notice to the regulator within 14 days of the ownership change. (The FTC declined to comment at the time.)The complaint Tuesday from Rosa — who had led information security at the company since January 2022 — offers new insight into the extent of the cuts made by Musk and the new leadership team he brought in following his acquisition.Shortly after the takeover, Musk laid off 50% of Twitter’s staff. Musk also hired Steve Davis, head of Musk’s Boring Company, to work as a “high-level advisor” at Twitter and take over leadership of some departments, according to the complaint. (The Boring Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Davis.)“Davis, like Musk, was dismissive of the Twitter FTC Consent Decree and began cutting Twitter’s products and services that supported and complied with the Twitter FTC Consent Decree,” the complaint states.For example, Davis allegedly “did not want to pay” for the company’s vulnerability management software or its ethical hacking program, both of which were “necessary” to comply with the FTC agreement. Davis also directed Rosa to shut down the software systems through which Twitter shared time-sensitive, important information with law enforcement entities, a potential violation of the European Union’s Digital Services Act, the complaint states.Days later, Davis allegedly directed Rosa to cut Twitter’s physical security budget by 50% within hours.“Plaintiff immediately objected to participating in such activity, as he had a reasonable belief that such an immediate budget cut, after already cutting the budget by 50%, would put the physical building at risk of violating a Court Order … and it posed a substantial danger to public safety,” the complaint states.After Rosa objected, Davis allegedly removed his oversight of the physical security team; five days later, Rosa learned he’d been terminated when his access to company systems was removed without notice.With the lawsuit, Rosa is seeking to be paid his severance, as well as a $200,000 bonus, more than $300,000 in vested equity compensation and other benefits — money he claims he was denied after the company began what the complaint calls a “sham investigation” regarding his conduct while he was employed.",4086,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/tech/elon-musk-x-information-security-lawsuit/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230120140132-clare-duffy.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,european leadership initially raise reason respond change penalty share investigation ongoing ftc sham public fire request owner mislead arbitration requirement expert bonus submit service dismissive compensation unlawful enforcement restrict handle offer company system regard clause put law allege day demand multiple learn extent file digital pose consent global department head begin deny accord equity information benefit entity potential late technology october commission private privacy conduct termination million protects sign twitter agree vulnerability require safety behalf accuse former boring year takeover duty immediately claim alleges direct object cybersecurity follow complaint act spokesperson billionaire january team musk ownership associate program deficiency threaten decree make shut court fail violate concern jersey hire contract laid paid access refuse substantial x rosa abruptly alan regulator work software allegedly support legal regulatory tuesday violation data comment building compliance severance advisor lead participate employ personal risk trade remove terminate ethical seek union decline staff regular consumer belief pay federal oversight danger activity important engage vested budget elon government give money notice management cut time order issue brought hack comply insight agreement reasonable immediate steve plaintiff settlement physical attempt davis product security call lawsuit,-0.8368,0.14684287812041114,11.495825375170533,0.31385667063633155,0
CNN,Adele just may be the coolest class mom ever,2023-12-07 13:09:00,Lisa Respers France,"The desire to care and give is strong with Adele.From advising up-and-coming singers to being a “class mom” for her 11-year-old son’s school, the superstar, who has far from a normal life, seems pretty normal when it comes to wanting to be of service to others.That is on display in her latest interview with The Hollywood Reporter.As the recipient of the Sherry Lansing Leadership Award from The Hollywood Reporter’s annual Women in Entertainment, Adele would have been forgiven for showing off her power.But, instead, she sounded humble when reminded that past honorees include Oprah Winfrey, Barbra Streisand and Viola Davis.“I’ve always been in wonderful company, and all the music stuff and everything like that, but this is a little bit out of me depth,” she said.“But no, it’s the most insane list of previous winners,” Adele continued. “And also, I genuinely knew who Sherry Lansing is. For her to even consider me in any fashion is kind of funny.”Now settled into life in Los Angeles among other people who are also famous, she told the publication she’s managed to find a friend group that happens to include other moms.That’s important to the woman who took the time to make 60 chicken kebabs for her kid’s class. Being involved with her son’s school led Adele to say, “I’m thriving a bit.”“Now there are so many things his school does the most, with community vibes, which is fantastic. The kids don’t care,” she said. “The kids don’t give a flying f**k who I am. And I get, not insecure, but I get nervous around loads of adults and strangers that I don’t know. And so making food for school events, it’s my dream.”Adele extends that same kind of care, she said, to rising artists.“I’m not going to say who they are — I see a lot of the girls, up-and-coming singers, I get in touch with them because no one ever did that to me, gave me any advice or any secret nuggets of truth or tricks of how to survive it in any way,” she said. “So I have them ’round and we have some wine and I talk to them.”“Wine Down with Adele” is a show we would love to watch.

CNN,First on CNN: Klobuchar questions drug company behind 10-fold spike in price of lead poisoning antidote,2023-12-07 14:36:00,Meg Tirrell,"The $32,000 cost of a crucial drug to treat severe lead poisoning drew ire from Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who wrote a letter to the chief executive of the drug’s maker on Thursday, seeking answers on how the company reached its price.The letter followed CNN’s reporting Wednesday that the drug, made by Rising Pharmaceuticals, costs almost 10 times more than an imported version of the medicine from France, which the US Food and Drug Administration had allowed to be used in the US while the drug was in shortage.Toxicologists told CNN that the price can make it difficult for hospitals to stock the medicine, called calcium disodium EDTA, potentially leading to delays of days when patients need urgent treatment. EDTA is used for the most severe cases of lead poisoning, when blood lead levels get high enough – including in children – that it can cause seizure, coma and brain swelling.“Rising’s decision to price this generic injectable at ten times the price of the imported version from France is leading to avoidable and dangerous delays in patient treatment and compromising patient care,” Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, wrote in the letter to Rising CEO Vimal Kavuru. “Please explain the reasoning behind Rising Pharmaceuticals’ decision to adopt a price for its generic that well exceeds the price of many expensive brand products on the U.S. market.”The senator asked Kavuru to list the factors that went into the pricing decision and whether the company was seeking to capitalize on the shortage of the drug in the US. She also sought answers about the effects on patient care and why a US version must be priced so much higher than a French one.Klobuchar, who’s chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, also recently sent a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf urging the agency to address levels of toxic heavy metals in food for babies and young children in the wake of reports of lead exposures from contaminated pouches of cinnamon applesauce.The FDA’s investigation of that matter continues, with more than 60 cases reported among children under the age of 6 as of Tuesday. The lead is suspected to have been from tainted cinnamon from a distributor in Ecuador.“Lead is toxic to people of all ages, but can be especially harmful to infants and young children,” Klobuchar wrote to the FDA, along with several colleagues from Congress.Children can also be exposed to lead from paint in older homes, and exposure can build up over time until, in rare cases, a drug like EDTA becomes urgently required.If a hospital doesn’t have the medicine in stock, it can take a few days to find it, Dr. Diane Calello, medical and executive director of the New Jersey Poison Control Center, told CNN.“Two or three days when you have a child who’s in a coma or having seizures or is really critically ill is intolerably long,” she said.Rising didn’t respond to CNN’s requests for comment.",2952,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/health/klobuchar-letter-lead-poisoning-antidote-price-hike/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207115017-amy-klobuchar-file-2023.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,contaminate reason respond seizure cinnamon generic treatment investigation pouch case blood dangerous continue request urge expose patient sought make rare version factor chief long ten policy brand klobuchar crucial administration competition heavy ceo agency jersey medical califf exceeds recently shortage exposure address brain company chair effect tuesday difficult diane matter comment day metal adopt write senator find told cost democratic cnn level expensive pricing senate lead executive child reporting suspect reach delay wednesday seek import decision robert colleague control food amy high stock vimal explain intolerably disodium kavuru toxic injectable consumer baby judiciary include french hospital director price medicine pharmaceutical build severe commissioner answer calello home maker france thursday time wake urgently young taint ire urgent especially critically subcommittee potentially center letter avoidable poison treat list compromise distributor capitalize age infant follow rise product coma report harmful edta drew call antitrust paint fda calcium,-0.911,0.4065040650406504,9.91396768402154,0.43170231729055264,0
CNN,‘Yellowstone’ creator and actor battle over coffee company’s logo,2023-12-07 12:33:00,Jordan Valinsky,"A very real legal drama over coffee is brewing on the set of a fictional TV show.The ranch of Tyler Sheridan, who is the showrunner and creator of the hit TV show “Yellowstone,” is suing the coffee brand created by Cole Hauser, one of the show’s actors, for “trademark infringement, unfair competition and false advertising” over the logo used for Hauser’s new coffee company.In the lawsuit filed last month, Sheridan’s ranch argues that the logo for its Bosque Ranch Craft Coffee, named after his ranch in Texas, is similar to that of Hauser’s coffee brand, Free Rein, because they both have “two overlapping letters.”Bosque Ranch has been using the overlapping “BR” logo since 2004 and launched a coffee lineup in June 2023. In October, Free Rein coffee was created and started using a logo with the “FR” letters overlapping for one of its logos.Sheridan’s ranch claims that Hauser and his coffee company had not “asked or received permission or authorization” from Sheridan “to use a mark confusingly similar to the ‘BR’ brand for virtually identical goods.” It added that the logo is “likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association” with Bosque Ranch.Bosque Ranch, which Sheridan has owned for nearly 20 years, is seeking an injunction against Hauser’s brand along with damages and profits from Free Rein. It’s also demanding the company “destroy all products, marketing, and promotional materials displaying” the logo.Free Rein didn’t immediately return CNN’s request for comment.Attorney Josh Gerben told CNN that trademark infringement cases are “typically very close calls and depend heavily on the evidence the parties are able to bring forth in trial.”A judge or jury will have to make a determination if the “average consumer might be confused into purchasing the Free Reign Coffee product when it was seeking to buy a Bosque Ranch Craft Coffee product,” he said.For example, if other coffee brands have similar logos with overlapping letters, Gerben said the case would be weak for Bosque Ranch because there would be a “crowded marketplace of similar trademarks” that would show shoppers aren’t looking at just the logo or a two-letter acronym when picking a coffee brand.“I do not consider this to be a slam-dunk case and think a decision would be a close call for any judge or jury,” Gerben said, who is not involved in the case.As for a lawsuit between two co-workers, Gerben said it’s a “little surprising to see” since he thinks there was “clearly an opportunity for settlement discussions to take place.” Sheridan filing a federal lawsuit suggests the ranch felt that settlement discussions “were not obtaining the result it desired,” Gerben added.",2730,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/food/yellowstone-coffee-lawsuit/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180928162227-jordan-valinsky-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,advertising tv purchasing jury lineup depend shopper fr affiliation argues june case return unfair profit request average identical party judge suggests make surprising discussion launch cole injunction brand close competition desire free overlap opportunity similar josh showrunner confusingly acronym confusion reign drama marketplace mark yellowstone legal company destroy month start receive add virtually br creator damage told cnn demand trademark actor display marketing file seek decision buy deceive tyler consider evidence logo consumer heavily federal texas false material connection real crowd october bosque sheridan association set gerben involve hauser fictional hit determination ranch permission promotional brewing mistake show letter weak obtain pick filing confuse coffee create craft bring rein year immediately settlement claim product result typically infringement call felt lawsuit authorization,-0.71875,0.0,9.28834586466165,0.5103535353535353,0

CNN,US indicts Russians over hacking campaign against US intelligence officials and effort to interfere in UK election,2023-12-07 15:27:00,Sean Lyngaas,"The US Justice Department on Thursday announced charges against one Russian intelligence officer and one Russian IT worker for conducting a years-long cyber-espionage campaign against current and former US government officials, and interfering in a national election in the United Kingdom.In the UK, the two Russian operatives were part of “sustained unsuccessful attempts to interfere in UK political processes” over several years that hacked politicians, civil servants and journalists, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in a statement. British diplomats have summoned the Russian ambassador to the UK and condemned the alleged interference activity, Leo Docherty, a UK Foreign Office minister, said in a statement to parliament.The two Russian men — Ruslan Aleksandrovich Peretyatko, an officer with the FSB intelligence service, and IT worker Andrey Stanislavovich Korinets — also tried to hack numerous current and former US intelligence and Defense Department employees, as well as those at the State and Energy Department, from 2016 to 2022, according to the US indictment unsealed in federal court in San Francisco.In some cases, the hackers successfully breached victims’ email accounts and stole “valuable intelligence” related to US defense and security policies, foreign affairs, as well as information on nuclear energy technology, the US indictment alleges. That stolen intelligence “would be particularly valuable to the Russian government’s efforts to engage in malign foreign influence” in the US, the indictment says.The Russian embassy in Washington, DC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The US Treasury Department announced sanctions against Peretyatko and Korinets, and the State Department offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the identification and location of the men. The men live in Russia, US officials said, meaning the prospect of them appearing in a US court room is slim.It’s the latest attempt by the US and its allies to expose alleged Russian hacking and influence operations in an effort to make them less impactful. It comes as US officials brace for sustained foreign interference efforts in the 2024 US presidential election.A successor to the Soviet-era KGB, the FSB has multiple elite hacking teams at its disposal that it uses to surveil Russian citizens, interfere in foreign politics and burrow into US critical infrastructure, according to US officials and private sectors.In this case, Peretyatko and Korinets are accused of being part of an FSB plot to cause havoc ahead of the 2019 UK general election in part by leaking hacked documents on US-UK trade negotiations.Ciaran Martin, the former head of UK government’s National Cyber Security Centre, told CNN that the hack-and-leak operation did not create the divisions in UK society around the election that the Russians apparently were hoping for.“The most heartening aspect of this story is the way different parts of the British system pulled together,” said Martin, who is now managing director at investment firm Paladin Capital Group. “The adversaries targeted people from across the political spectrum,” including a leading Scottish nationalist member of parliament, Martin said.“Crucially, rather than seek to exploit this for political gain, the Conservative Government, through Security Minister Tom Tugendhat, treated the operation as a serious threat to our democratic system,” he added.Whether a sharply divided US political system will react in a similar way to potential Russian hack-and-leak operations in 2024 remains to be seen. Hackers backed by Russian military intelligence leaked troves of Democratic National Committee emails during the 2016 election, according to US officials and private experts, causing a stir in the US media for many weeks.Don Smith, vice president of threat research at cybersecurity firm Secureworks, who has tracked the indicted FSB hacking group for years, called them a “persistent irritant” that conduct “Russian information operations straight out of the textbook.”From straightforward hack-and-leak operations to standing up their own websites to launder information aimed at UK readers, the Russian group’s “attempts to weaponize stolen information have evolved over that time,” Smith, who regularly confers with UK officials on cyber threats, told CNN.This story has been updated with additional developments.",4423,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/us-indicts-russians-hacking-campaign/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230627142321-sean-lyngaas-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,disposal steal respond confers servant manage back russia pull russian request threat remains critical breach crucially expert charge ahead prospect brace firm service adversary nationalist similar smith regularly weaponize burrow commonwealth leo effort korinets react aim embassy offer system politics reader identification email tugendhat allege ruslan sharply tracked particularly told democratic cnn multiple successfully launder evolve san room stole medium tom story department head paladin accord information live energy capital worker elite late potential military political technology apparently andrey current stand private society operation indict conduct million fsb exploit meaning hearten national website accuse former kgb civil hacker year affair immediately leak nuclear alleges cybersecurity related member condemn official team vice victim martin scottish case justice politician defense dc treasury impactful expose make operative ally court foreign policy division centre uk interfere influence united aleksandrovich valuable diplomat journalist straight parliament campaign unsealed president investment different minister part interference group presidential research infrastructure successor trove lead persistent state malign trade citizen seek update stanislavovich havoc sustain process irritant federal aspect include director document general activity engage summon government stir docherty account employee plot announce thursday time statement washington additional hop office hack unsuccessful target intelligence conservative sanction secureworks cyber development create spectrum election numerous peretyatko treat location divide indictment reward straightforward attempt ambassador security surveil call british officer committee,0.8725,0.0,13.582359249329755,0.2683375367801597,0

No one was injured during Sunday’s incident, but at least one of the tourists lost a cellphone in the mishap, which occurred while the gondolier was trying to maneuver under a low bridge, police said.There was no damage to the gondola but its upholstered chairs and blankets were thrown into the canal, a spokesman for the city’s gondola association told CNN Thursday.He confirmed that the gondolier had instructed the tourists not to move around or stand up to take selfies during the maneuver, but due to a language barrier, the tourists did not comply.The association recently limited the number of riders on gondolas from six to five, with the maximum weight per rider capped at 230 pounds.There are currently 430 licensed gondoliers in Venice who work in shifts to accommodate tourists. The trade is often passed down from fathers to sons.

CNN,CNN to host two GOP presidential primary debates in 2024,2023-12-07 21:26:00,,"CNN will host two Republican presidential primary debates next month in Iowa and New Hampshire – states that hold the first contests in the race for the 2024 GOP nomination, the network announced Thursday.The events will provide Republican voters an opportunity to hear the governing philosophies of the leading candidates seeking to challenge the likely Democratic presidential nominee, President Joe Biden, in November.The first debate will take place on January 10 at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, less than a week before Iowa caucusgoers weigh in on the Republican presidential race. The second debate will be January 21 at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire.To qualify for participation in the Iowa debate, candidates must receive at least 10% in three separate national and/or Iowa polls of Republican caucusgoers or primary voters that meet CNN’s standards for reporting, according to the network. One of the three polls must be an approved CNN poll of likely Iowa Republican caucusgoers.Candidates will be invited to participate in the New Hampshire debate if they receive at least 10% in three separate national and/or New Hampshire polls of Republican primary voters that meet CNN’s standards for reporting. One of the three polls must be an approved CNN poll of likely New Hampshire Republican primary voters. Candidates who finish in one of the top three positions in the Iowa caucuses will receive an invitation to participate in the New Hampshire debate.Former President Donald Trump, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have hit 10% in at least three qualifying polls, including one of likely caucusgoers in Iowa. DeSantis said Thursday in a post on X that he is “looking forward to debating in Iowa!”The qualifying window for the Iowa debate closes on January 2 and the New Hampshire debate qualifying period ends on January 16.According to the network, in each debate, candidates must also meet the definition of a “natural-born citizen,” as well as age and residential requirements as defined by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, file a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission and agree to accept the rules and format of the debate.To determine polling eligibility in Iowa, only polling data collected from surveys that began no earlier than October 15, and released no later than 12:05 p.m. ET on January 2, will be considered.In New Hampshire, only polling data collected from surveys that began no earlier than November 1, and released no later than 12:05 p.m. ET on January 16, will be considered.Poll results reported with a decimal place will not be rounded up or down in either case.National and state polling shows that former President Donald Trump holds a commanding lead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.

CNN,A Texas judge ruled a pregnant woman who sued the state seeking an abortion can legally terminate her pregnancy,2023-12-07 23:39:00,Ashley Killough,"A Texas judge ruled Thursday that a pregnant woman who sued the state seeking a court-ordered abortion can legally terminate her pregnancy.The decision marks a significant development in the ongoing debate over the state’s medical exception to its controversial ban on abortions after six weeks – one of the strictest in the nation.Kate Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, filed a lawsuit this week asking a state district court in Austin court to temporarily block the state’s abortion ban, because she has been unable to get the procedure due to concerns of violating the law. Cox’s baby was diagnosed with trisomy 18 and is not expected to live more than a few days outside the womb, according to the suit.After the ruling, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton warned Cox’s physician she could still face civil and criminal penalties at some point should she perform the court-ordered procedure.Cox’s lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by an individual seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, according to the New York Times.Cox, 31, has been to three different emergency rooms in the last month due to severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks, according to her suit. She has had two prior cesarean surgeries – C-sections – and, the suit said, “continuing the pregnancy puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”In an emergency hearing Thursday, a judge granted a temporary restraining order against the state that would allow Cox to immediately have an abortion.“The idea that Mrs. Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said. “So I will be signing the order and it will be processed and sent out today.”Cox and her husband were present for the hearing – which took place over Zoom – and grew emotional at the judge’s decision and could be seen wiping away tears.Molly Duane, Cox’s attorney, said they are working to figure out “the fastest way to get her abortion care” but will not disclose when for the safety of her client, her family and physician.Duane said the fight is far from over, as the ruling only applies to Cox and does not “restore access” to abortion to thousands of other women. She called the state’s argument “callous in the extreme,” and said “they don’t care whether people live or die as long as they’re forced to give birth.”Marc Hearron, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, added: “This can’t be the new normal. I don’t think you can expect to see now hundreds of cases being filed on behalf of patients. It’s not realistic.”Paxton, in the letter threatening future legal action, wrote that Cox has failed to demonstrate she has a “life-threatening” medical condition related to her pregnancy or that her symptoms place her “at risk of death” or major bodily harm.The letter was sent to three hospitals in Houston where, according to the Texas Medical Board, Cox’s physician has privileges. It was released to the media by Paxton’s office. CNN has reached out to the hospitals for a response.The state attorney general warned the hospitals that Thursday’s ruling “will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability,” including first-degree felony prosecutions and civil penalties of at least $100,000 for each violation.And the ruling, Paxton wrote, does not prevent civil action by private citizens – a reference to Senate Bill 8, the controversial Texas law that allows people to sue those who perform or facilitate an abortion.A lawyer representing Texas argued Thursday that Cox’s pregnancy symptoms did not meet the standard set out by the state for a medical emergency that would allow for an abortion.Johnathan Stone, special counsel with the state attorney general’s office, said Cox’s doctor made a “subjective” belief that Cox qualified for an abortion, rather than basing her medical opinion on “objective” standards outlined in the law.The argument over subjective versus objective medical reasons for an abortion is central to the ongoing debate and legal fights regarding the state’s exception rule. Critics argue the rule is vague and unclear – causing doctors, who face a felony for performing an illegal abortion, to refrain from taking action. The state maintains the language in the law is adequate and clear.Duane argued the state was second-guessing her client’s physicians and saying Cox was not sick enough. Duane works for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has been involved in a separate court battle against the state to seek clarity on the state’s medical emergency exception.“They have moved the goalposts once again. Now a patient must be about to die before a doctor can rely on the exception,” she said of the state, calling the position “cruel and dangerous.”CNN has reached out to the state’s attorney general office for comment.Trisomy 18, sometimes called Edwards syndrome, is a chromosomal condition that can cause heart defects and other organ abnormalities. In about half of the cases, the fetus dies before birth. Many children who are born with it die within a few days, and more than 90% die within a year.Attorneys for the state argued Cox’s condition – as laid out in the court filings – was not severe enough to meet the state’s medical exception standard and that the judge would be essentially changing the law if she granted the temporary restraining order.Cox’s gynecologist, Dr. Damla Karsan, has previously said she had a “good faith belief” that Cox falls under the legal exception to the abortion ban, but couldn’t provide the abortion without a court order because she “cannot risk loss of her medical license, life in prison, and massive civil fines” if her belief is not accepted by the courts.The state allows for abortions after six weeks if a woman experiences a “medical emergency,” which is defined in the law as “a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that, as certified by a physician, places the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.”A group of 20 women and two physicians have been fighting the state in a separate lawsuit over the medical exception this year, arguing the language in the law is unclear and causes doctors to refrain from performing abortions in serious cases due to a lack of clarity in the law.Before the Texas Supreme Court last week, an attorney with the state’s attorney general office argued the law was clear and that if women with life-threatening medical issues were not receiving abortions, then it should be considered negligence on the doctor’s part.Cox said that although she has gone to the emergency room three times with severe cramping, the law is too vague to make clear whether an abortion under those circumstances would be legal.“I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy. I do not want to put my body through the risks of continuing this pregnancy,” Cox said in a statement released by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit in Travis County.Cox wrote in an op-ed for the Dallas Morning News that her unborn baby girl was diagnosed with full Trisomy 18.“I’m trying to do what is best for my baby daughter and myself and my family, but we are suffering because of the laws in Texas,” Cox wrote. “I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.”“I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health, for parenting my children, and for a future pregnancy,” she added.",7809,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/us/texas-abortion-ruling/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/141231151425-ashley-killough.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country guerra born reason vague fall aggravate condition change penalty opinion ongoing reproductive impairment continue argument fluid daughter patient paxton major long organ half arise callous ban lose illegal doctor symptom husband body warn define qualify ken temporary argue full function rule marc cox genuine wade defect procedure gamble regard strictest represent subjective receive law put rely day travis austin write prosecution unable cnn privilege release critic senate outline child plague exception refrain reach clarity room bill file medium pregnant emergency present negligence consider move baby trisomy due temporarily accord texas live hearron prevent signing experience chromosomal board girl fast significant private set suffer wipe figure certify action idea zoom birth applies stone center reference complication safety surgery filing behalf fight life duane civil year leak immediately lack loss damla client shock controversial away related abnormality dy miscarriage syndrome clear gynecologist central abortion meet criminal justice case liability morning threaten ruling chance judge force essentially make diagnose special court fail edward fetus houston violate restore objective demonstrate expect concern uterine goalpost roe supreme perform normal laid karsan lawyer medical unidentifiable access substantial family maya pregnancy maintains believe work sick license fertility disclose mark grant legal cruel month hundred add attorney different physician cesarean bodily death group prison accepted extreme debate base unborn overturn rupture week state risk heart place restrain seek citizen terminate ability decision facilitate legally high parent york position prior future cramp belief process include grow felony danger hospital general point suit previously give arrive world severe woman individual health involve order time thursday statement issue pain circumstance office versus womb desperately news insulate standard provide letter unclear development watch emotional fine thousand faith block adequate physical hearing language battle dallas separate massive attempt district counsel call lawsuit,-0.9976,0.42258932001536686,9.25114797611148,0.3635117635987201,0
CNN,Opinion: The life-and-death history lesson that doctors aren’t learning,2023-12-07 11:11:00,Kirsi Goldynia,"The Hippocratic oath serves as a mission statement for physicians, articulating principles that guide their work. Its tenets include beneficence, nonmaleficence and confidentiality, but they are often summed up by one simple phrase: “Do no harm.”It may seem unthinkable, then, for a doctor, guided by this oath, to knowingly put a person’s life at risk. But history has proven that it can happen — and on a grand scale.In Nazi Germany, many physicians who supported the Nazi ideology carried out dangerous and torturous medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners. Drugs and medical treatments were tested on them before being used on military personnel. Sterilization experiments were conducted to identify the most efficient way to control the population of Jews, Roma and other groups. And, most famously, Dr. Josef Mengele carried out cruel experiments on twins.Dr. Robert Klitzman, the co-founder of the Columbia University Center for Bioethics, says that to make sense of the cognitive dissonance required for a doctor to act with such malice, we must recognize that people have a tendency to rationalize their behaviors. He spoke with CNN Opinion recently about a growing call among physicians and medical institutions around the world to learn from history so we don’t repeat it.Indeed, as retired physician Raul Artal, who was born in a concentration camp, wrote in a 2016 article published by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC): “Nazi physicians claimed the moral high ground by transforming the Hippocratic Oath from a doctor-patient relationship to a state-Völkskorper—or nation’s body—relationship. They justified the sterilization or elimination of ‘lives not worth living’ as a merciful preventive measure, simultaneously ending the suffering of the genetically inferior and preventing transmission of their presumably hereditary harmful traits.”After World War II, nearly two dozen physicians, scientists and public health officials were among the Nazi leaders who were tried for their role in the holocaust at the Nuremberg Trials. This represented a moment of reckoning for the global medical community. How could medical crimes against humanity be prevented from ever happening again? The answer, the court decided, was to create 10 directives for human subjects research: the Nuremberg Code.We still rely on this code today, and have created additional regulations and ethics bodies to review the conditions of medical research. Nonetheless, experts have warned that we mustn’t be complacent.“The history of medicine during Nazism and the Holocaust can support such critical reflection at all stages of the professional life cycle. It can help us recognize patterns to avoid or aspire to, and thus support us in the development of our own stories of ethically responsible health care,” wrote doctors Hedy Wald and Sabine Hildebrandt in an editorial published by AAMC in 2022.The Lancet Commission on Medicine, Nazism, and the Holocaust argued in a lengthy report, “The core values and ethics of health care are fragile and need to be protected.” The commission has called for health care education to include a history-informed framework “to emphasise the unique opportunities and responsibilities of health professionals in the elimination of antisemitism and racism and the protection of vulnerable populations against stigmatisation and discrimination.”For Klitzman, these are much-needed calls to action. “[The Holocaust] reminds us how fragile our ethical and moral standards can be,” he says, noting that one important way for us to keep our values in check is to examine history — study the Holocaust and other instances of moral failing in medicine — and for medical professionals to be vigilant about checking their own biases.Learning from the past is not a radical idea. But, as so many experts are reminding us, if done earnestly, it could have a radical effect on the future.The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.Robert Klitzman: Examining these issues is important for several reasons. Paraphrasing from the philosopher George Santayana: Those who do not learn from history are destined to repeat it.A major problem is that physicians in the Nazi era, who were trained to follow the Hippocratic Oath and to abide by high moral standards, abandoned those principals under political and social pressures. The reason that’s important is that it reminds us how fragile our ethical and moral standards can be. And, unfortunately, there have been times — and there are still times — when physicians have not followed the ethical and moral standards they should.For instance, there is still racism in healthcare. If you look at outcomes during the Covid-19 pandemic, people of color were at higher risk of dying from Covid. The evidence suggests that it’s not due to something biological, but rather access to care and, in some cases, the treatment they received.So, we know that biases, racism, antisemitism, etc., can creep into health care. We’ve seen repeated examples of it since the Holocaust. Physicians need to be aware of that history so they can avoid repeating it.Klitzman: What the Nazis did made us more aware of the importance of bioethical principles and led to the development of better guidelines to try to ensure that doctors follow the ethical guidelines they should.The Hippocratic Oath that doctors take doesn’t cover research ethics. It does not touch on risk-benefit ratios for research participants – the assessment of the potential risks and the potential benefits for the participant. It doesn’t touch on informed consent – the idea that participants consent to being part of the study, with full information of what it means for them. It doesn’t touch on equity – the idea that you do not want to disproportionately burden or benefit any particular groups through the research.After the horrific Nazi experiments, it was overwhelmingly clear that the medical experimentation performed by the Nazis needed a response and so, during the Nuremberg Tribunals a set of guidelines was developed for medical research. So, the events of the Holocaust have already informed our bioethics, but it’s important to continue examining this history as the world evolves and our medical ethical principles need to evolve along with it.Klitzman: I think that the curriculum in many medical schools would benefit from providing more information on the Holocaust and Nazi experiments, and other violations of research ethics that have occurred. This heightened awareness could change the ways medical students appreciate medical ethics because bioethical principles can seem very straightforward, uncontroversial and easy to follow, and, therefore, easy to dismiss as not requiring particular attention.However, the Nazis and the Holocaust vividly and dramatically illustrate how physicians can come to deviate from ethical standards and justify to themselves egregious ethical failures – how “blind” doctors can become when they face conflicting pressures and goals.Klitzman: The Hippocratic Oath is a statement that emphasizes the fact that practicing medicine is a moral enterprise.Medicine involves people putting their bodies and private information in your hands as a doctor. If someone says, “‘I’ve had four miscarriages,” or “I am an addict,” or “I’m gay,” they’re trusting you that their body and their privacy are safe. There is an implicit social contract. And because of this, society has decided not to overly regulate doctors with laws. Instead, doctors have a great deal of discretion. And in return, doctors are committed to following a very high moral standard. In the West, parts of that standard are articulated in the Hippocratic Oath.Klitzman: Eugenics is the notion that you can improve the genes of individuals or society. It’s very much aligned with racism and prejudice.Hitler’s idea was to “improve” the genes of the German people, which meant that if someone was disabled, gay, Jewish, etc., he wanted to get rid of them. I should make very clear that eugenics is completely warped and not based on anything scientific; in the case of the Nazis, it was used as a weapon against anyone Hitler’s regime deemed “inferior.”Eugenics is not to be confused with public health; it’s one thing to want to improve the health of a country. But that’s extremely different than saying, “Let’s improve the genes of the country by getting rid of certain people.”Klitzman: There are several ways gene editing could lead to eugenics, with parents who can afford it paying to create children with the most socially desirable traits. But there are also more complicated scenarios that could arise.Let’s take the example of using gene editing technology to remove from an embryo genes associated with various diseases – whether cancer or Alzheimer’s. This may, on the surface, seem like a good thing. But, in fact, this raises a number of concerns because wealthy people could pay to remove these genes, while poor people likely could not. This could lead to more disparities in society; certain diseases, which now unfortunately affect many people, whether rich or poor, could increasingly become diseases of the poor. And, of course, that’s a problem because then there would likely be fewer resources for people with these conditions, less money devoted to research, etc.One of the bioethical principles, as I said, is to avoid unfairly burdening or benefiting one group or another. Eugenics threatens that bioethical principle of social justice. So, we need to be very careful.Klitzman: The Tuskegee study was one of the most egregious examples of medical experimentation, with grossly inadequate informed consent. Starting before World War II, The Tuskegee Institute and the US Public Health Service, wanted to understand the natural course of a syphilis infection. So researchers decided to follow a group of poor, Black sharecroppers in the South, many of whom were semi-literate, and decided to see how untreated syphilis affected their bodies over time.One of the problems with the study was that, after World War II, when penicillin was discovered to be the definitive cure for syphilis, the researchers decided not to offer penicillin to the study subjects because that would have inevitably ended the experiment. They decided that the value of the experiment was worth the suffering of and risk to the subjects.The Tuskegee study went on for decades until the 1970s, when a story about it came out in the press and led to an advisory panel reviewing the study. This shows us that, even after the Holocaust, here in the US there were still instances of unethical medical research.As a result of the Tuskegee study, the National Research Act was passed in 1974, which was key in establishing modern research ethics as we know them today. Since then, we’ve also developed research ethics committees or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), to help ensure that research is carried out ethically.But even with these formalized research ethical standards, it is often a fight to make sure that guidelines are followed.Klitzman: When it comes to combating distrust in the public health system we have to ask: What is the message? Who’s giving it to whom? And how is it being given?If we have White doctors telling everyone, “You need to do this, you need to do that,” and people who don’t have trust in the system aren’t given much choice in the matter, that’s problematic.Trust is easily broken and once broken, hard to reestablish, but having the message come from people who understand that distrust, and who are willing to listen to what people’s concerns are, is important. And, of course, the first step is acknowledging the fact that bad things have been done in the past that have understandably led to distrust.",11815,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/opinions/holocaust-medical-ethics-education-klitzman-goldynia/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206134348-nazi-doctors-scientists-arraignment-file.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country raise discretion condition response change cognitive opinion reminds continue outcome public retire cover suggests critical trial touch core major natural experimentation service disabled philosopher scientific body moment happen argue covid deviate pattern desirable developed phrase biological hereditary color institution system matter put paraphrase rely law panel course key cnn edit child simple school unfairly avoid robert story consent global klitzman train carry nonmaleficence evidence framework increasingly equity mengele military prevent potential nation listen history antisemitism unthinkable earnestly living affected measure nazi private privacy suffer set guide george action abide untreated ideology humanity famously require reckon life blind presumably publish unfortunately understand step acknowledge eugenics inadequate warp harmful miscarriage result burdening clear wealthy syphilis lengthy social beneficence alzheimer justice dangerous penicillin embryo cycle fail hand abandon college healthcare concern tenet opportunity contract creep access understandably grossly commit proven gene uncontroversial work bioethical recently rotl principle support ethic socially implicit cruel article tuskegee part efficient lancet group pandemic research failure ground cure check remove holocaust ethical transform worth combat identify parent note decide tribunal pay include grow tendency aspire disparity examine dramatically important give money personnel association time vividly trait additional ratio instance standard problem emphasise burden provide egregious show development addict destine confuse create rom horrific conflict white human wald hitler institute great community dismiss curriculum committee vulnerable born reason behavior length dozen definitive advisory broken treatment return german threatens importance jewish josef regulate participant inferior weapon aamc relationship american expert improve heighten unethical doctor bias warn simultaneously appreciate directive interview professional population full prisoner devote sterilization inevitably disease rationalize unique poor offer effect practice represent cancer start deal review raul responsible write meant ethically study decade learn evolve overwhelmingly trust irbs crime resource confidentiality nonetheless reestablish due information benefit event establish sum particular nazism past role political technology scientist racism medicine stage board guideline commission answer modern spoke society student conduct university hildebrandt west bioethics idea test institutional center experiment national fight merciful press radical rich hard santayana follow articulate act preventive report inform evolves extremely official leader assessment responsibility person surface associate repeat case number notion code aware illustrate make camp genetically court knowingly involves perform instead remind medical transmission safe formalize education sabine pressure concentration violation germany different physician serf easy message awareness complicate black easily base regulation fragile torturous lead fact value benefiting risk justify protection control high editorial occur rid claimed justified dissonance nuremberg researcher hedy scenario affect gay malice afford columbia recognize oath emphasizes world distrust reflection ensure individual health overly disproportionately subject statement issue completely mission elimination today regime principal vigilant discover jew hippocratic straightforward sharecropper south infection align deem stigmatisation choice call pass grand,-0.040200000000000014,0.0761743546339399,10.544988431281809,0.4403924836601308,0
CNN,"Major donor calls on UPenn president to resign for disastrous testimony on antisemitism, threatening $100 million gift",2023-12-07 22:21:00,Matt Egan,"The walls appear to be caving in on the University of Pennsylvania’s president, Liz Magill, who faces scathing criticism over her performance at a House hearing earlier this week.Prominent donor Ross Stevens threatened to claw back a $100 million donation. The university’s board of trustees held an emergency meeting Thursday. And the powerful Wharton Board of Advisors that leads the university’s prominent business school called for a leadership change at the university.Magill remained president after the hastily arranged board gathering concluded Thursday, a source familiar with the proceedings told CNN. But Magill faced a rebellion from Wharton’s Board of Advisors, and a growing coalition of donors, politicians and business leaders who denounced her testimony.During Tuesday’s House hearing, Magill, along with the presidents of Harvard and MIT, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.Magill had already been under fire from prominent donors, faculty, students and alumni prior to Tuesday’s hearing after multiple incidents of antisemitism on campus in recent months – and what critics have said was a tepid response to those incidents.A major donor called on Magill to resign and threatened to rescind stock, costing the university $100 million if she doesn’t.Wall Street CEO Ross Stevens sent a letter on Thursday to Penn threatening to take steps that would cost the Ivy League school approximately $100 million if Magill stays on as president, CNN has learned.Stevens, a Penn alum and CEO of Stone Ridge Holdings, argues he has clear grounds to rescind $100 million worth of shares in his company that are currently held by Penn. He specifically cites Magill’s disastrous testimony before Congress earlier this week.“Absent a change in leadership and values at Penn in the very near future, I plan to rescind Penn’s Stone Ridge shares to help prevent any further reputational and other damage to Stone Ridge as a result of our relationship with Penn and Liz Magill,” Stevens said in a note to his employees on Thursday obtained by CNN.Lawyers at Davis Polk, representing Stone Ridge, wrote a letter to Penn that cites an agreement between the school and the firm. That agreement, according to Stone Ridge, gives the firm the ability to retire the shares for cause, including potential damage to Stone Ridge’s “reputation, character, or standing.”The Wharton Board of Advisors, comprised of a who’s who group of business leaders, has joined the growing chorus of voices calling for Magill’s immediate ouster.“As a result of the University leadership’s stated beliefs and collective failure to act, our Board respectfully suggests to you and the Board of Trustees that the University requires new leadership with immediate effect,” the Wharton Board of Advisors wrote in a letter sent directly to Magill.The letter, which appears to have been sent Wednesday, specifically cites Magill’s disastrous testimony.“In light of your testimony yesterday before Congress, we demand the University clarify its position regarding any call for harm to any group of people immediately, change any policies that allow such conduct with immediate effect, and discipline any offenders expeditiously,” the letter reads.The strong criticism comes from an influential group of Penn alumni. Its members include billionaire NFL owner Josh Harris, former Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau, Blackstone exec David Blitzer and BET CEO Scott Mills, according to the Wharton Board of Advisors website.“Our board has been, and remains, deeply concerned about the dangerous and toxic culture on our campus that has been led by a select group of students and faculty and has been permitted by University leadership,” the Wharton board letter said.The University of Pennsylvania’s board of trustees held an emergency meeting Thursday.One source familiar with the board’s proceedings told CNN Scott Bok, the chair of Penn’s Board of Trustees, was expected Thursday or Friday to talk to Magill about possibly stepping down. But another source with close knowledge of the board’s activity denied that meeting was taking place and said the board was not close to holding discussions with Magill about a leadership change.A spokesperson for Penn said there is no immediate plan for the board to replace Magill.“There is no board plan for imminent leadership change,” the spokesperson said.Penn currently does not have an interim president lined up if Magill were to step down, a source said.After the fallout from Tuesday’s hearing, Magill attempted to clarify her message on Wednesday, posting a video on X where the Penn leader said she should have focused on the “irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate.”Magill said that Penn’s policies “need to be clarified and evaluated,” adding that in her view: “It would be harassment or intimidation.”Harvard President Claudine Gay similarly issued a statement Wednesday clarifying her comments.“There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,” Gay said in the new statement posted on X. “Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”In a Thursday statement to CNN, MIT’s deputy director of media relations, Sarah McDonnell, said the university “rejects antisemitism in all its forms.” Harvard on Wednesday clarified its president’s testimony, echoing Magill and MIT.However, the executive committee of MIT said in a statement it is standing by its president, Sally Kornbluth.“The MIT Corporation chose Sally to be our president for her outstanding academic leadership, her judgment, her integrity, her moral compass, and her ability to unite our community around MIT’s core values. She has done excellent work in leading our community, including in addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate, which we reject utterly at MIT. She has our full and unreserved support,” the statement said.Still, the hearing on Tuesday drew strong and widespread criticism.Magill’s future hangs in the balance as a House committee is investigating Penn’s actions.Following the board’s virtual meeting, the House Education and Workforce Committee launched an investigation with full subpoena power into Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik announced Thursday afternoon.“We will use our full Congressional authority to hold these schools accountable for their failure on the global stage,” Stefanik said in a statement. “After this week’s pathetic and morally bankrupt testimony by university presidents when answering my questions, the Education and Workforce Committee is launching an official Congressional investigation.”Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, chairwoman of the committee, called the testimony “absolutely unacceptable.”“Committee members have deep concerns with their leadership and their failure to take steps to provide Jewish students the safe learning environment they are due under law,” Foxx said in a statement.A growing number of politicians and business leaders are also calling on Magill to step aide.A university spokesperson told CNN the board of trustees organized Thursday’s virtual gathering at approximately 2 pm ET Wednesday. That came just hours after Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro condemned Magill’s testimony as “shameful” and urged the board of trustees to meet and decide whether that testimony lives up to the school’s values. Despite its name, Penn is a private school and is not run by the state.Former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman Thursday night called on the board of trustees to remove Magill.“Let’s make this great institution shine once again,” Huntsman said in a statement shared exclusively with CNN on Thursday evening. “We are anchored to the past until the trustees step up and completely cut ties with current leadership. Full stop.”Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, was a 1987 graduate and former UPenn trustee. In October, he blasted Penn’s response to antisemitism on campus and promised to halt his family’s donations to the university. Now, Huntsman is going further, calling for a complete leadership change.“At this point it’s not even debatable,” Huntsman said. “Just a simple IQ test.”Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the testimony “catastrophic and clarifying” and said Magill’s attempt to clean-up her testimony “looked like a hostage video, like she was speaking under duress.”“I understand why the governor of Pennsylvania and so many of the trustees don’t have confidence in her. I don’t have confidence anymore that Penn is capable, under this leadership, of getting it right,” Greenblatt told CNN’s Kate Bolduan, adding that he has spoken with Magill.The ADL CEO said his organization did not have a position on whether or not the university presidents should step down – until Tuesday’s hearing.“But when I watched these presidents flail and feebly, with legal-ish answers respond to a simple line of questioning, we have lost confidence with them,” he said.Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNBC on Thursday that “advocating for genocide is fundamentally wrong, full-stop. We just can’t have this.”The Massachusetts Democrat said she’s worried that Americans can’t disagree with each other. “We have unleashed hate in this country – and that is wrong,” Warren said.Asked if the college presidents should step down, Warren said: “If you can’t lead, if you can’t stand up and say what’s right and wrong – very much in the extreme cases, and these are the extreme cases – then you’ve got a problem.”Billionaire Elon Musk, who graduated from Penn, added to the criticism.“I am a Penn alum and this is indeed shameful,” Musk said on X on Wednesday.Of course, Musk himself faced condemnation last month after agreeing with an antisemitic post. Musk later apologized for what he called his “dumbest” ever social media post.Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Thursday said she agrees with calls for the presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania to resign, arguing they are “failing in the worst way.”“Their statements were abhorrent,” Gillibrand told Fox News, referring to Tuesday’s hearing in the House. “Trying to contextualize what constitutes harassment? Jewish students are terrified on these campuses.”The New York Democrat said that in some cases, students have been told to stay in their dorm rooms because their safety couldn’t be guaranteed.“That is the definition of harassment: To instill fear and to not have a climate where kids can thrive and go to school and feel protected. They are failing in the worst way as college presidents,” Gillibrand said. “You cannot call for the genocide of Jews, the genocide of any group of people, and not say that that’s harassment.”This story has been updated with additional developments.",11290,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/business/penn-emergency-meeting-liz-magill/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220428153356-matt-egan-profile.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country bullying harvard islamophobia depend response change argues cave cnbc investigation line retire unite urge elizabeth suggests remains core major huntsman lose catastrophic ceo power trustee strong argue alum view shameful deputy address company condone institution relation wrong blau law shine told irrefutable course cost cnn multiple critic yesterday demand congressional harm simple school conclude fox room offender terrible faculty story global tepid kate toxic harris prevent potential video antisemitism donation october violence upenn stand private harassment possibly advocate agree wall stone concerned polk similarly require former life performance workforce utah absent disastrous liz understand step condemn graduate explicitly result billionaire clear pm despite musk social meet dangerous greenblatt threaten abhorrent alumnus excellent fail policy college expect concern organize dorm wharton tie plan criticism josh morally discipline x exclusively family gathering expression fear flail holding work influential support bankrupt president tuesday respectfully governor group spoken kirsten failure jeff advisor ground week scott remove permit select unleashed worth knowledge virtual gillibrand update arrange confidence note penn decide speak magill earlier position prior unreserved york include grow alex activity denounce elon give night nfl balance employee compass announce coalition hold familiar additional house circumstance deep provide testimony prominent letter sally watch contextualize development confuse halt hearing source human necessarily terrify ambassador davis great community kid reject organization committee warren climate rebellion leadership respond refer share back academic complete ridge corporation jewish hang feebly fire owner promise interim resign relationship american chairwoman vile close firm culture free stefanik exec utterly full hostage campus subpoena proceeding religious effect regard represent powerful condemnation damage bolduan write constitutes pathetic anymore remain learn executive reputation bet wednesday medium emergency worried explain stock imminent fundamentally deny accord due capable sarah chose past hastily widespread stage board meeting current answer student conduct million university iq republican congress talk idea form adl foxx light safety obtain absolutely friday blackstone immediately post specifically related member held act deeply spokesperson drew mill official leader echo scathing jon character case politician agrees number gorsky genocide code expeditiously debatable make stay massachusetts ivy discussion mcdonnell launch bok indeed violate antisemitic donor instead hate recent claudine safe hour shapiro definition collective education thrive directly chair month claw question add fallout johnson environment message david extreme judgment incident lead ethnic fact state value approximately place join reputational jonathan street ability blitzer elise feel replace comprise focus blast future chorus belief protect league gay director virginia clarify run point outstanding accountable ross anchor instill disagree thursday cut dumbest completely statement issue voice pennsylvania stevens authority news agreement integrity immediate jew rescind business attempt apologize call currently evaluate investigate democrat,-0.99635,0.10628875110717449,10.525510009532884,0.4936775747792693,0
CNN,The dirty truth about taking your shoes off at the door,2023-12-07 11:58:00,Sandee LaMotte,"At-home holiday parties are on many people’s calendars right now, and germ-conscious hosts are faced with a dilemma: Should I require my guests to take off their shoes at the door, especially if the gathering is cocktail or formal attire — or the guest is a stylish shoeaholic like Carrie Bradshaw?In a 2003 “Sex and the City” episode, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is asked to leave her $485 Manolo Blahnik shoes at the door during a New York City baby shower hosted by her friend Kyra (Tatum O’Neal) and soon finds they have been stolen.“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends. The iconic TV character had been forced to walk home in her party dress and old gray sneakers lent by her host.“Why in the h*ll did you take off your shoes to begin with?” asked Carrie’s friend Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).“We had to!” Carrie explained. “For their kids — apparently we drag things in on our heels that make children sick.”While the episode, “A Woman’s Right to Shoes,” was designed to discuss dilemmas facing single people in a world focused on families with children, the underlying question — and debate — around footwear and health remains: Is there significant evidence going shoeless stops the spread of germs in a home?“Absolutely,” said Gabriel Filippelli, chancellor’s professor for the department of Earth sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute.“We can track in all sorts of bacteria, but certainly some of the ones we’re most concerned about are E. coli that cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting,” he said. “There’s been studies that swab the bottom of shoes and something like 99% of the shoes test positive for fecal material.”However, bacteria are not the only danger that rides along with the dust and dirt surrounding rural and urban homes, gardens and parks, said Jill Litt, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado in Boulder who is currently working as a senior researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, or ISGlobal, in Spain.“Studies have shown that in urban areas where there are older homes, lead in dust can be tracked into the home on the surface of shoes,” she said. “Other studies have shown that you can bring in pesticide residues from gardens via shoes.”Heavy metals like lead and copper and zinc permeate the soils of urban parks and streets from decades of pollutants, while pesticide levels can be high in rural agricultural areas, Litt added.Homes built before 1978 are very likely to contain lead-based paint, which can chip, peel and disintegrate into dangerous dust, experts say. There is no safe level of lead at any age, but children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of heavy metals and pesticides due to their small size and proximity to contaminants as they crawl, roll and play on the floors of the home.“For little ones, hand to mouth is one of the primary ways children get exposed to toxic substances and infectious disease agents,” said Litt, who is also a leader of Reimagining Environments for Connection and Engagement: Testing Actions for Social Prescribing in Natural Spaces. Funded by the European Union, the project aims to fight loneliness with natural spaces.Before you ask folks to take off their shoes, be sure the home is as dust-free as possible, experts say. Never vacuum or sweep with a broom first, as that will only stir up all the toxins, sending them airborne. Instead, reach for the wet or spray mop. As counterintuitive as it may be to add water to dirt, it’s actually the best way to remove toxins, Litt said.The same goes for any horizontal surface, Filippelli said, but stay away from feather dusters. “Do more regular cleaning of horizontal surfaces with a damp cloth — that’s windowsills, tables, coffee tables, chair bottoms, chair seats and other furniture in addition to the floor.”Use the “three-bucket” method if you live in an older home with lead paint or an area with high levels of lead outside. Have one bucket ready with an all-purpose cleaning solution, another to rinse and an empty bucket.“Some folks also use a very weak vinegar solution in their wash water, which works really well,” Filippelli said. “There are some super sterilizers on the market, but when cleaners are really good at killing bacteria, they’re usually not very good for us as human beings. Whenever you can smell a superstrong smell from something, you got to at least think twice about it.”Dip your mop into the cleaning solution, squeeze the excess water into the empty bucket, and begin to mop, starting from the farthest point from the door. Work toward the door, using the clean water as a rinse as you go. Flush water into the toilet when it looks dirty or with each new room — don’t throw it outside.“The highest concentration of germs is in the interior entry way and levels go down as you move greater distances from this area,” Litt said. “Carpeting retains a lot of dust so that would be one thing I would remove if you had concerns about dusts and potential health concerns.”Carpeted areas should be vacuumed with a device that has a high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filter, not bagless vacuums, and throw the bag or filter away in an outside trash can when done.Taking off shoes at the door may be the best way to limit germs and potentially toxic dust from coming inside, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think of your guests’ comfort, Filippelli said. Providing washable slippers or nonslip socks can be a thoughtful gesture.“I do not like to walk around with bare feet inside, so here’s my hack. I have some warm slippers right inside my front door — a lot of other cultures do that as well,” he said.“Go to any Asian household, or even a Middle Eastern one and there’s often a little cubby right inside the door with washable slippers. You’re supposed to take your shoes off there and take the slippers and put those on.”Would that have solved Carrie’s shoe-removal problems? No, those were taken care of when she asked Kyra to buy new Manolo’s as a gift for Carrie’s impending marriage — to herself.“That’s all she registered for?” Kyra asked the salesperson, as her kids ran around the swanky Manolo Blahnik store on Madison Avenue.",6359,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/health/remove-shoes-germs-wellness/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210415170254-life-but-better-relationships-logo-large-169.png?q=h_155,w_650,x_0,y_0/w_1280/h_80",Health | Science | Technology,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,loneliness european cocktail vulnerable litt tv smell lot send ready sock pesticide vomit interior seat addition remains shoeless horizontal track discus expert disintegrate stop fecal hepa filippelli samantha natural wash flush culture washable sort agent warm cloth impend project senior full earth ride superstrong cleaner leave particulate disease built primary thoughtful aim rural airborne effect damp front start put soil metal tracked jones study decade level swanky dip mouth executive child vacuum dress contaminant bradshaw reach room attire buy global positive underlie department explain bloody clean entry squeeze begin boulder evidence toxic move chip lent baby due live abdominal foot sarah potential eastern small apparently shower bag cubby permeate engagement floor madison significant vacuumed heel home university zinc action spread play gabriel design filter market test concerned guest dirty require fight register absolutely bring ran duster stylish away single agricultural copper footwear parker tatum water shoe leader middle inside sweep resilience broom marriage reimagining windowsill cattrall barcelona pollutant social vinegar surface proximity folk character dangerous kyra carrie kill slipper expose residue party force gray sneaker make stay solve hand possible isglobal city table suppose formal professor heavy colorado store iconic distance concern air instead comfort limit counterintuitive chancellor household family gathering retains safe wet bagless bottom work indianapolis friend toxin chair mop concentration science indiana question add roll environment empty park coli dilemma walk diarrhea salesperson find debate avenue super trash feather surround lead garden remove jessica rinse bucket street host union spray high crawl method regular infectious focus dust york researcher cramp shoeaholic lunch danger director dirt fund space sterilizer drag swab episode excess bacteria connection throw lament point cleaning carpeting blahnik stir world prescribe severe device woman solution health furniture holiday gift germ contain peel especially hack asian farthest potentially provide problem show weak nonslip coffee urban calendar environmental carpet sex manolo neal age human jill toilet institute substance great kid size currently area paint,0.9157,0.2830633747444567,7.8445652173913025,0.44376247570396493,0

CNN,"Foreign governments may be spying on your smartphone notifications, senator says",2023-12-07 12:25:00,Brian Fung,"Foreign governments have reportedly attempted to spy on iPhone and Android users through the mobile app notifications they receive on their smartphones — and the US government has forced Apple and Google to keep quiet about it, according to a top US senator.Through legal demands sent to the tech giants, governments have allegedly tried to force Apple and Google to turn over sensitive information that could include the contents of a notification — such as previews of a text message displayed on a lock screen, or an update about app activity, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said in a new report.Wyden’s report reflects the latest example of long-running tensions between tech companies and governments over law enforcement demands, which have stretched on for more than a decade. Governments around the world have particularly battled with tech companies over encryption, which provides critical protections to users and businesses while in some cases preventing law enforcement from pursuing investigations into messages sent over the internet.But mobile notifications, which sometimes display messages on lock screens even when the communications themselves may be encrypted, can present a workaround by giving governments access to more information about a device and its user’s activities.The demands for mobile notification data, if fulfilled, could potentially jeopardize the safety of political dissidents, human rights workers, journalists and minorities worldwide, in the same way that legal demands for other types of mobile device information can. It is unclear how many times Apple and Google may have complied with these requests, when they first began receiving them, or from whom.The revelation follows a year-long investigation by Wyden’s office and highlights the creative and expansive tactics governments use to monitor their people; the power of large tech platforms and the range of useful information they hold on their users; and the US government’s own role in limiting transparency surrounding the practice.The inquiry showed that governments have access to a wide range of revealing insights through mobile notifications, which are also known as “push” notifications.“Apple and Google are in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps,” Wyden wrote in a letter Wednesday to the Justice Department outlining his findings. “The data these two companies receive includes metadata, detailing which app received a notification and when, as well as the phone and associated Apple or Google account to which that notification was intended to be delivered.”Wyden added that in some circumstances, the companies “might also receive unencrypted content, which could range from backend directives for the app to the actual text displayed to a user in an app notification.”During the investigation, Wyden’s team learned from Apple and Google that the US government had prohibited the companies from disclosing information about government attempts to collect mobile notification data. Wyden’s investigation began after his office received a tip about the practice last spring, he wrote.“Apple and Google should be permitted to be transparent about the legal demands they receive, particularly from foreign governments, just as the companies regularly notify users about other types of government demands for data,” Wyden wrote. “I would ask that the DOJ repeal or modify any policies that impede this transparency.”The Justice Department declined to comment on Wyden’s letter and did not respond to questions about whether the US government has ever filed its own legal demands to the tech giants for mobile notification data.After Wyden’s findings became public on Wednesday, Apple said it was now free to say more about the practice.“Apple is committed to transparency, and we have long been a supporter of efforts to ensure that providers are able to disclose as much information as possible to their users,” the company said in a statement. “In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information and now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.”Apple’s publicly posted law enforcement guidelines covering the United States now includes language addressing the company’s Push Notification Service, the in-house system that delivers mobile notifications to Apple devices. According to the guidelines, Apple will supply agencies with a user’s Apple ID that’s tied to notifications if it receives at least a subpoena.Google said in a statement that it was the first company “to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden. We share the Senator’s commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.”Google said its transparency reports have historically included requests for mobile notification records as part of aggregate figures it displays. It added that in the United States, the company requires a court order to comply with demands for mobile notification records and that a subpoena is insufficient.The tech industry has increasingly pushed back on the US government’s use of gag orders to prevent the disclosure of law enforcement data requests.In 2021, Microsoft sharply criticized what it described as the overuse and abuse of nondisclosure orders that prevent tech companies from notifying users when the US government comes knocking for their account information. During a congressional hearing that year, Microsoft said it receives as many as 10 secrecy orders per day and 3,500 per year, a figure that accounts for up to a third of all law enforcement requests the company receives, according to an internal review stretching back to 2016.That hearing had come in response to separate revelations that a Trump-era Justice Department subpoena had targeted congressional staffers.",5993,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/tech/apple-google-notifications-ron-wyden/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/1418603-0556-r-ps2560x1440.jpeg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,user minority spring respond refer response top share record investigation impede id back smartphones public intend mobile request cover tension critical kind wide monitor long app highlight finding large pursue service described free jeopardize agency type power directive encrypt regularly backend subpoena content abuse sensitive enforcement effort unique address company system practice receive law review sharply day lock senator write decade particularly democratic demand congressional learn outline push notification overuse wednesday file inquiry workaround tip fulfil present department begin increasingly accord information platform particular prevent worker late role political historically ron reveal reportedly guideline supply prohibit figure apps displayed commitment expansive staffer turn require safety unencrypted year publish supporter post disclosure follow transparency tech report inform dissident encryption team quiet reflect worldwide tactic receives delivers associate case justice doj number range force provider revelation court possible internal policy foreign repeal preview wyden tie access limit united industry text commit secrecy journalist disclose allegedly giant nondisclosure legal metadata actual question add part data comment publicly message criticize phone microsoft surround reporting notify state surveillance display modify permit update facilitate protection decline method collect position federal aggregate include screen transparent activity government give android oregon world ensure device account creative iphone time hold order statement detail gag circumstance office comply target insight potentially provide show letter unclear apple google hearing language battle human stretch knock separate communication business attempt spy,0.9605,0.0,13.228172888015713,0.3642944625995473,0
CNN,‘Oppenheimer’ to be released in Japan after delay following ‘Barbenheimer’ controversy,2023-12-07 10:23:00,Jack Guy,"Cinemagoers in Japan will soon be able to see box office hit “Oppenheimer,” months after much of the rest of the world.The blockbuster’s release was postponed amid controversy over an unofficial marketing campaign that critics said trivialized the 1945 nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Film distributor Bitters End said in a statement posted to social media Thursday that the movie, directed by Christopher Nolan, would be released in Japan in 2024.“It is being referred to as ‘Nolan’s ultimate masterpiece’ and gaining attention as a prime contender in all film awards categories,” read the statement posted on Instagram. A specific release date wasn’t announced.The three-hour biopic has broken several records since its global release earlier this year, becoming the highest-grossing movie set during World War II, according to Universal.However, “Oppenheimer” was also at the center of some controversy. The movie, which tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, considered the father of the atomic bomb, was released on the same July weekend as “Barbie,” a film about the iconic Mattel doll, in many parts of the world.As a result, many people went to see both movies as a kind of double-header, and social media was awash with unofficial fan-made “Barbenheimer” memes.The posts﻿ triggered outrage in Japan, and the Warner Bros. Film Group apologized after the X account, formerly Twitter, for its “Barbie” film sparked backlash over its embrace of memes that appeared to depict the character immersed in atomic blast imagery from “Oppenheimer.”The posts from the official “Barbie” account responding to the unofficial memes were later deleted. But screengrabs posted on X showed the “Barbie” account responding positively to a meme of a mushroom cloud superimposed on the head of Margot Robbie, the film’s star, and to another post depicting “Oppenheimer” actor Cillian Murphy carrying a cheerful Barbie on his shoulder against a burning backdrop.Critics said the posts trivialized the nuclear attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US Air Force in 1945, which killed at least 110,000 people instantly and tens of thousands more from its aftereffects.Warner Bros. Film Group said in a statement to CNN at the time: “Warner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement.

CNN,House votes to censure Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman over fire alarm incident,2023-12-07 22:48:00,Clare Foran,"The House voted on Thursday to censure Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York for triggering a fire alarm in a House office building when there was not an emergency.Censure amounts to a significant rebuke of a member of Congress, though it does not carry an explicit penalty beyond a public admonition of a lawmaker and is not as severe as expulsion.Censure is typically a rare move by lawmakers, but Republicans have led efforts to censure two other Democrats since June. Bowman is the third censured since the GOP took control of the chamber. The GOP-led censure resolution passed by a vote of 214 to 191.Following passage of the resolution, Speaker Mike Johnson called for Bowman to present himself in the well of the House chamber and publicly announced the censure. A crowd of Democratic lawmakers gathered around Bowman as that happened.The New York Democrat told CNN Thursday evening that the censure is “another example of how the Republican Party is not serious about governing.”“They have no ideas, they have no policies, they can’t inspire the American people, so they focused on censuring me even though after the fire alarm incident I took full responsibility right away,” Bowman told CNN’s Abby Phillip on “NewsNight.” The congressman also denied that he pulled the fire alarm to delay a House vote, which many Republicans have accused him of doing.Bowman was caught on tape pulling a fire alarm in the Cannon House Office Building in late September, shortly before the House was scheduled to vote on a government funding bill. The building was subsequently evacuated. The congressman said following the incident that it had been an accident.“I was trying to get to a door. I thought the alarm would open the door, and I pulled the fire alarm to open the door by accident,” Bowman said at the time, adding: “I was just trying to get to my vote and the door that’s usually open wasn’t open, it was closed.”In October, Bowman was charged by the DC attorney general over the incident and subsequently pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for falsely triggering a fire alarm in a House office building.Republican Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan put forward the resolution to censure Bowman, saying on X, “Nobody is above the law, Congressmen included.”The resolution stated that if the House voted to censure Bowman, he must present himself in the well of the House where they would read out the censure notice.“Representative Jamaal Bowman will forth with present himself in the well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure,” the resolution states.Bowman and other Democrats have spoken out against the censure effort.“It’s painfully obvious to myself, my colleagues, and the American people that the Republican Party is deeply unserious and unable to legislate. Their censure resolution against me today continues to demonstrate their inability to govern and serve the American people,” Bowman said on the House floor Wednesday.“The legal process on this matter has played out. In no way did I obstruct official proceedings … Unfortunately, Republicans are here trying to rehash an already litigated matter,” the congressman said, saying that he “took responsibility and accountability for my actions and plead guilty.”On Wednesday, the House voted down a Democratic motion to table – or block – the resolution by a tally of 201 to 216, setting up a final vote over the censure on Thursday.The censure resolution will come to the floor less than a week after the House voted to expel indicted GOP Rep. George Santos of New York – the most severe form of punishment for a member. That vote brought an end to a scandal-plagued and tumultuous tenure on Capitol Hill for the freshman congressman. Expulsion is exceedingly rare and requires a two-thirds majority vote to succeed – a high bar to clear.The Republican-controlled House has brought censure resolutions against other Democratic lawmakers as well.In November, the House passed a GOP-led resolution to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan over comments critical of Israel and in support of Palestinians amid Israel’s war against Hamas.Tlaib defended herself, arguing that the censure was an effort to silence her and saying that her “colleagues have resorted to distorting my positions in resolutions filled with obvious lies.”In June, the House voted to censure California Rep. Adam Schiff, a key lawmaker in Democrats’ congressional investigations into former President Donald Trump during his presidency.Ahead of the vote, Schiff called the move “a badge of honor” and said, “They wouldn’t be going after me if they didn’t think I was effective.”This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.",4717,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/jamaal-bowman-censure-house-vote/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180507170345-clare-foran-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,abby funding november alarm penalty succeed investigation exceedingly hill rashida admonition continue public pull fire pronouncement amount critical rare american charge congressman caught michigan tenure subsequently tlaib argue full mike explicit effort inability proceeding shortly open govern matter put law amid told democratic cnn unable key congressional lisa rebuke distort passage bill falsely wednesday inspire defend colleague story present silence carry expel deny move california painfully rehash late crowd october floor significant set indict adam george republican action congress idea form bar trigger accountability speaker obstruct require accuse resort former unfortunately cannon palestinian away follow member deeply typically schiff headline official motion september responsibility litigate june majority dc guilty party schedule unserious punishment forward policy table demonstrate tally censure mcclain x israel legal obvious support tape president lawmaker add attorney gop johnson comment publicly honor spoken building freshman chamber incident lead week plead state trump misdemeanor serve delay update control high representative legislate focus vote york position process jamaal general government played severe phillip announce thursday time capitol evacuate brought additional house office final today badge expulsion donald development bowman block accident fill santos resolution gather read call pass tumultuous democrat,-0.9837,0.0,10.756245654692933,0.4249056704612259,0
CNN,Trump attends New York civil fraud trial as accounting expert testifies for defense,2023-12-07 18:06:00,Kara Scannell,"Former President Donald Trump was in court for his New York civil fraud trial on Thursday where an accounting expert sought to bolster the defense argument that company valuations are a highly subjective process.Trump cast the trial as “corrupt” in brief comments to reporters before entering the courtroom, criticizing the judge presiding over the trial, Arthur Engoron, and New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought the case against him.“We did absolutely nothing wrong,” the former president said.Trump also praised defense accounting expert Eli Bartov, who testified Thursday. A professor of accounting at New York University’s Stern School of Business, Bartov said that accounting standards offer wide latitude for valuation calculation methods used on personal financial statements.The former president’s appearance in court comes one day after the fourth GOP presidential debate, which Trump skipped. The former president, who is leading the Republican primary, declined to answer questions about the GOP race Thursday morning as he criticized the attorney general’s civil case against him. He later told reporters he attended court Thursday to make sure the public “gets the true story.”The high-stakes civil case strikes at the heart of Trump’s brand – his real estate empire. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state.Judge Engoron has already ruled that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for fraud.The thrust of the Trump defense is that the financial statements were not misleading and that different people can come up with different values for the same property.The defense has argued that there was no intent to defraud banks or insurers, in part because the Trump family relied on accountants, and that any differences in values on the properties were not meaningful.“My main finding is that there is no evidence whatsoever for any accounting fraud,” Bartov testified Thursday. “On another end, my analysis shows that the statements of financial condition were not materially mistaken.”“So in your expert opinion, the AG’s claims have no merit?” Engoron asked.“That is absolutely my opinion. Absolutely.” Bartov said.While he acknowledged there were errors in Trump’s financial statements, noting that the price of Trump’s triplex apartment at Trump Tower was inflated, Bartov maintained, “Errors like that are not unusual.”Bartov, who argued Trump’s brand is worth $3 billion, said he’d searched for clues that there was something wrong in the statements or reports but he “couldn’t find a single provision that was violated. I couldn’t find one.”Trump attorney Jesus Suarez also walked Bartov through a Deutsche Bank credit report showing Trump and Deutsche Bank used different cap rates – the amount of return a real estate asset is expected to generate in a year – to determine the value on Trump Tower in 2013.“The AG interpreted this as fraud. This is not fraud. This is obvious. This is an expected difference,” Bartov said.In one tense moment, Bartov took issue with an objection from a lawyer for the attorney general, Louis Solomon.When Solomon objected, saying part of Bartov’s testimony was now outside the scope of his expertise because he’s not a banker, Bartov shouted at him, “Shame on yourself, talking to me like that!”“You make up allegations. I’m here to tell the truth,” Bartov said. “You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”In September, before the trial began, Engoron ruled that the Trumps engaged in “persistent and repeated fraud” by inflating the value of assets on the financial statements.The state is attempting to prove six other claims, including conspiracy, falsifying business records, issuing false financial statements, and insurance fraud.“Donald Trump engaged in years of financial fraud and enriched himself and his family,” James, who was not in court Thursday, posted on X. “We have already proven the massive scale of his fraud. No matter how much he lies, the facts don’t.”The attorney general’s office had objected to Bartov’s testimony, arguing his extensive testimony about the complaint was not relevant because he was not addressing evidence admitted at trial.Also on Thursday, a New York appeals court agreed to stop the cancellation of Trump’s business certificates until after the civil fraud trial and any appeals are completed – a continuation of an earlier ruling by a single appeals court judge at the start of the trial.Trump, outside the courtroom, hailed the decision as a “very good ruling” moments after it was released. His attorney, Chris Kise, similarly told CNN the ruling “helps pave the way for a much needed, and deliberative, review of the trial court’s many errors.”The attorney general’s office had told the appeals court it did not object to pausing the cancellation of the business certificates.Trump is expected to testify again in the trial on Monday. Alina Habba, an attorney for the former president, told reporters outside the courthouse Thursday that Trump will do so despite her advice not to because he’s under a gag order in the case.“He still wants to take the stand even though my advice is at this point you should never take the stand with a gag order. But he is so firmly against what is happening in this court,” Habba said Thursday.The former president is barred from discussing court staff after a New York appellate court reinstated his gag order late last month.Engoron originally issued the order barring Trump from making public statements about his court’s staff after Trump made numerous comments about a clerk, who Trump says is biased against him.This story has been updated with additional information.CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.",5786,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/trump/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180501155607-kara-scannell-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,allegation enter condition insurance record opinion kristina complete return inflate argument generate public mislead banker sought amount cancellation expert relevant trial stop wide intent shame contribute bias appeal courtroom moment tower argue happen rule continuation primary habba hail valuation address offer company louis subjective maintain matter wrong start rely thrust review day property told insurer cnn release deliberative school extensive praise cast eli financial holmes story conspiracy alina stern ashamed strike reporter accounting expertise cap begin evidence appellate sgueglia empire originally false late clerk price stand answer interpret james arthur million university republican talk triplex bar agree bank similarly clue defraud preside former search absolutely credit enrich civil skip year claim provision acknowledge post object single complaint shout attend report kristen jesus ag difference fraud despite liable firmly september rate error repeat case defense pause engoron morning ruling objection advice scope judge appearance make estate court analysis brand violate professor expect apartment whatsoever lawyer certificate falsify family x admit proven bartov deutsche discuss obvious chris president determine question reinstate attorney different gop bolster part comment tense walk criticize find presidential debate highly lead scale fourth persistent fact materially state value personal trump heart seek worth update decision letitia decline staff method note monday york earlier latitude include general pave engage real point prove calculation suarez order thursday corrupt race statement brought asset additional issue gag office accountant truth standard testimony testify show donald solomon numerous courthouse business massive attempt billion merit lie,-0.9723999999999999,0.1555478741790529,10.112036866359443,0.3841325067250993,0
CNN,Susie Wolff rejects conflict of interest allegations after FIA announces investigation,2023-12-07 10:01:00,,"F1 Academy managing director Susie Wolff has rejected conflict of interest allegations between her and husband, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff, after the FIA announced an investigation on Tuesday.This comes after the FIA, motorsport’s governing body, issued a statement saying: “The FIA is aware of media speculation centred on the allegation of information of a confidential nature being passed to an F1 team principal from a member of FOM [Formula One Management] personnel. The FIA Compliance Department is looking into the matter.”While the FIA statement did not name the individuals it was investigating, and noted that it was not making the allegations, media reports identified them as the Wolffs.According to Business F1 magazine, some unnamed F1 team principals believe that the Mercedes boss “now has access to confidential information that they do not, via his wife, which is not being shared with them and Wolff is using to his own benefit.”“I am deeply insulted but sadly unsurprised by the public allegations that have been made this evening,” Susie wrote on X, formerly Twitter.“It is disheartening that my integrity is being called into question in such a manner, especially when it seems to be rooted in intimidatory and misogynistic behaviour, and focused on my marital status rather than my abilities.“In the strongest possible terms, I reject these allegations,” the Scottish former professional racing driver added.Mercedes also issued out a statement on Tuesday denying the allegations, claiming to have learned about the investigation through a media statement.“The Team has received no communication from the FIA Compliance Department on this topic and it was highly surprising to learn of the investigation through a media statement,” Mercedes said.“We wholly reject the allegation in the statement and associated media coverage, which wrongly impinges on the integrity and compliance of our Team Principal,” the F1 team added.All nine other F1 teams released an identically-worded statement on Wednesday denying that they had made a complaint.“We can confirm that we have not made any complaint to the FIA regarding the allegation of information of a confidential nature being passed between an F1 team principal and a member of FOM [F1] staff.“We are pleased and proud to support F1 Academy and its managing director through our commitment to sponsor an entrant in our liveries from next season.”Liberty Media, which owns F1, told CNN via email that the FIA statement had not been shared with them in advance.“We note the public statement made by the FIA this evening that was not shared with us in advance.

CNN,Opinion: The finest speech ever given in a presidential debate,2023-12-07 11:11:00,,"I’ve watched more than 8,000 debates. Admittedly, my life is not terribly exciting. But after Wednesday night’s fourth Republican presidential debate at the University of Alabama, I was rollin’ like the tide.If you were lucky enough to watch, you were treated to the finest speech ever given in a presidential debate. Let’s get right to it — here’s how the four candidates scored:Since all great speeches should have a title, I’m naming it “Chris Christie’s Retribution Speech.”To make a memorable argument in a debate, you need at least three things. First, the issue being debated has to be salient. Second, you need to lock down your position with good examples and evidence. Finally, your delivery is crucial. But even that’s not enough. For an argument to stand out in a debate, it must contain all three of those elements — and it must be a position not yet heard by the debating audience.The “Chris Christie Retribution Speech” met all the criteria.First: was the topic salient? Indeed it was, and the former governor of New Jersey knew it. Here’s part of his answer when asked what he thought of former President Donald Trump’s comments this week, that if elected again he would be a dictator only on “day one.”“Completely predictable,” said Christie. “This is an angry, bitter man, who now wants to be back as president because he wants to exact retribution on anyone who has disagreed with him, anyone who has tried to hold him to account for his own conduct…. Do I think he was kidding when he said he was a dictator? All you have to do is look at the history…”Second: Christie’s reasoning was solid, and his explanation of Trump’s popularity was smart debating. He took a weakness (Trump is polling way higher than Christie) and turned it into an attack on his debate opponents. Christie continued, “You want to know why those poll numbers are where they are? Because folks like these three guys on stage make it seem like his conduct is acceptable.”Third: You really need to watch his delivery. It’s a 2-minute speech, and it’s glorious. Watch Christie’s nonverbal movement and listen to his cadence. Hear the phrases and where Christie places the emphasis. One line stands out: Trump’s phrase of “I am your retribution,” when quoted by Christie, was chilling.Christie might have just given the single most important speech in presidential debating history. It was certainly the finest.Other Christie stand-out moments: Confronting fellow debater Vivek Ramaswamy, who was once again being himself. Christie told him to stop insulting Nikki Haley, said Ramaswamy had a smart-ass mouth, and gave this knock-out blow: “All he knows how to do is insult good people who’ve committed their lives to public service and not say anything that moves the ball down the field for the United States.”Christie continually chastised Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and others for not answering the question, astutely channelling the audience’s frustration with politicians’ question dodging.Finally, when talking about the sensitive topic of transgender care, while others like Ramaswamy and DeSantis were vilifying transgender kids and their parents, Christie reminded the audience of the sheer hypocrisy. “Republicans believe in less government, not more…yet we want to take parental rights away,” he said.And while Christie said he does not personally favor gender-affirming care, he’d rather have parents decide with their children rather than the “jokers” in congress overriding parent’s decisions.The former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor was lucky enough to collect some new donors this week. And that news, along with Haley’s rising poll numbers, should have been accompanied by a trigger warning because DeSantis and Ramaswamy began the debate with a barrage of attacks against her.And some of the criticisms landed — such as Haley’s apparent double standard on our relationship with China, and that she is taking too much money from big corporation leaders, thereby making her indebted to them.Haley was fortunate that the attacks were scattershot. Usually in presidential debates, the person getting teamed up on eventually wears down. Given the lack of a uniform attack from her opponents, an absence of specificity on some of the critiques and the fact that Christie defended Haley, the arguments against her simply didn’t stick. In fact, thanks to Ramaswamy’s excessively nasty and rude vitriol, I wouldn’t be surprised if Haley didn’t get even more support from a sympathetic audience.But let’s not forget that Haley, if given the time, can probably answer most of the criticisms. She defended her corporate relations, such as Boeing, with ease. Haley’s policy focus was evident once again; and she had an excellent answer for why we should prioritize supply issues when dealing with this difficult market and inflation. Haley also reminded us that deficits (and inflation) aren’t just a Democrat problem because Trump’s tenure only made it worse.What I liked most about Haley in this debate was her demeanor. I’ve criticized Haley in previous debates for being too eager to jump into the fray and quibble, especially about unimportant issues. Not this time. Haley was much better at selecting the time and place for her rebuttals.How she handled the tag-teaming from DeSantis and Ramaswamy was impressive. Most people would have lost their temper (Christie was on the edge) and let it affect their debating. Instead, Haley went the opposite direction and played it cool and calm. It was the perfect attitude adjustment.Even after being called a fascist by Ramaswamy, Haley simply smiled and said, “I love all the attention fellas. Thank you for that.” And then again after Ramaswamy’s flailing stream of consciousness insults, a debate moderator asked Haley if she’d like to respond. She replied with a bit of a smile. “No. It’s not worth my time to respond to him.” BAM.Some things never change. Florida’s governor simply can’t fix his nonverbal communication, especially his tortured facial expressions. It’s baffling and now I couldn’t stop staring.On foreign policy, DeSantis’s strengths were talking about the approach Florida took to China, but he missed badly when explaining the legality of his previous rhetoric about killing fentanyl smugglers, vigilante-style.DeSantis began this answer, as he did several times in the debate, by telling a story. The problem is that his stories are forced and poorly timed. Answer the question first, and then, if you must, tell a story. But I prefer my presidential debates to be story-free. They just don’t work in debates like they do on the stump.Finally, DeSantis has no transitions in his debating style. He attacks, introduces new topics, and randomly begins telling stories with no set-up and no clear way out.DeSantis is still a C debater. He’s not terrible. He’s not terrific. He’s just Ron.What’s a troll’s biggest fear? Being ignored. Trolls crave attention. You can read elsewhere about all of Ramaswamy’s antics. (Each debate he seems to be trying to outdo his previous one, so you can only imagine how ridiculous he was at times with his mean spirited, undignified verbal vomit.)Imagine how upset Ramaswamy must have been when Haley simply ignored his attacks and said he wasn’t worth her time. Not responding to him is probably worse for his ego than any verbal insult.You know you’re in trouble when a presidential moderator — Elizabeth Vargas — asks you point-blank about one of your policy proposals. “Is this a serious policy proposal, and if it isn’t, why do you keep repeating it?”At one point in the debate, Ramaswamy had a good debate strategy, but failed to successfully execute it. His plan seemed to be to highlight Haley’s lack of knowledge about Ukraine by demonstrating basic facts she is unaware of. It’s a winnable strategy. My teams have used similar strategies to highlight our opponent’s ignorance on any given topic.But Ramaswamy undermined his “gotcha” moment. Ramaswamy demanded Haley name three provinces in Ukraine where she might send troops because he figured she’d be stumped.Unfortunately, and this cannot be overstated, nobody cares. Apparently, Haley has not fully memorized the military strategy in various regions in Ukraine. You know what Ramaswamy included with this burger? Nothing, that’s what.My grade is as Christie predicted when he called out Ramaswamy: “This is the fourth debate that you would be voted in the first 20 minutes as the most obnoxious blowhard in America.”",8508,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/opinions/debate-coach-republican-presidential-debaters-graham/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206215149-christie-haley-ramaswamy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,grade quibble heard ball reason respond baffling send alabama change confront fella style element quote back indebted minute predictable eager vomit corporation smile line argument undermined public channel elizabeth consciousness relationship memorize stop opponent ridiculous troop continued lose highlight basic impressive popularity service moderator crucial smuggler troll warn stream audience similar introduces moment tenure fascist personally sensitive china terribly democrat vivek handle phrase difficult relation deal frustration day lock weakness told demand successfully mouth america child polling gotcha poll debater insult topic wednesday terrible province astutely defend fix story explain begin evidence move probably military nation fentanyl unaware listen apparently history region sympathetic ron stage angry fortunate deficit supply stand chastise corporate answer conduct dictator figure rollin university republican vitriol talk congress bit carolina retribution candidate market simply execute disagreed trigger imagine turn evident former life knew temper emphasis opposite field lack cool away unimportant single rhetoric ego clear leader team lucky explanation boeing person speech fully double folk absence solid barrage calm repeat politician admittedly number florida inflation accompany strength scattershot kill forget attack continually force crave make hear excellent spirit fail joker policy foreign indeed haley demonstrate favor predict facial donor jersey instead remind direction plan criticism poorly upset united expression commit fear flail believe demeanor work attitude support fellow chris previous movement surprised president fray wear land override vilify question christie obnoxious part outdo comment governor criticize debate presidential vargas overstate terrific badly title love week nikki prefer fourth fact proposal trump critique ignore smart place finally elect salient nasty select worth knowledge undignified cadence reply glorious legality uniform rude high big parent decide verbal focus collect position vote affect include excite torture perfect important stick prioritize burger point attention memorable transition give government night money played apparent account randomly parental bitter transgender score hold delivery time miss completely issue antic guy ignorance nonverbal contain especially desantis news standard problem blowhard donald sheer watch fine treat exact ease eventually ukraine ramaswamy strategy trouble south approach asks edge communication ambassador rise great specificity read kid call blow hypocrisy excessively jump winnable,-0.9561999999999999,0.10578279266572638,8.148301435406694,0.4842649921138293,0
CNN,"They bought a house in France for $20,000 without seeing it. Here’s what happened",2023-12-07 13:15:00,Tamara Hardingham-Gill,"Her fascination with France began when she spent a summer in the European country while working as an au pair back back in the 1970s.From then on, Ellen, originally from the East Coast of the US, made it her mission to travel to France whenever she got the chance to.She met her now husband Joseph, from the West Coast, in the late 1970s and the couple went on to marry and have three children, continuing to travel to the country as a family once every two years or so.“It’s funny, Joseph and our daughter would tease me, because anytime we were planning a vacation, I always wanted to come to France,” Ellen admits.“They liked France too, but they would say, ‘Can we go somewhere else?’ [I would say,] ‘Yes, as long as we stop in Paris first or something like that.’ So, it was a compromise usually.”Although Ellen and Joseph, who have chosen not to disclose their surname, had been toying with the prospect of moving to France for years, it wasn’t until they were both approaching retirement age that they began seriously thinking about buying a property there.Ellen came across a tiny rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l’Abbaye in Normandy, northern France, while browsing French real estate online, back in 2014.“The house was affordable,” says Joseph, who previously worked as a business executive. “It was obviously a bit of a ruin. But it was within our budget.“And that was always foremost in our minds. What can we budget? How much should we plan to spend on improvements, and so on and so forth. So, the budgetary element was pretty important for us.”They then spent some time checking out the “charming” village on Google Street View, and eventually came across an account of two American soldiers who’d been “helped by the French Resistance in the village during World War II.”The couple made the decision to purchase the house, which has around 400 square meters of living space, unseen, arranging for an inspector to view it beforehand.While the property was on the market for around 18,000 euros ($19,400), Ellen and Joseph ended up purchasing it for around 13,000 euros following negotiations with the seller.“It really wasn’t in move-in condition at all,” says Ellen, explaining that the house would need extensive work to make it liveable again. “The seller kind of agreed with that.”Once the sale was finalized, they brought in local builders to begin demolition work on the property, overseeing things from their California home.“They kept us informed. They would send us photographs to show us how the work was progressing,” explains Joseph. “And we would exchange ideas on how the renovation should unfold. So it worked out ok.”The couple continued to travel to France regularly, flying over in 2015 and 2016 and checking on the progress of the work.The following year they decided it was finally time to start the process of packing up their lives in the US and moving to France.The first big step was applying for a long stay visa, which took a few months to finalize, then came what Joseph describes as the “wind down procedure.”“Prior to your departure, there’s the decision to leave your homeland to go to another country, and all of the implications associated with that decision,” he notes. “All the preparation that has to be done in advance.”They sold off many of their possessions, keeping only items of sentimental value, and set things in motion so that they could manage their affairs from France.Ellen and Joseph, who also have a property in New York, decided to rent out their home in California rather than sell it.They then set about renting an apartment in Paris as their base while work on their Normandy home continued.“We found that, to be in the parts of Paris that we wanted to live in, it was much less expensive to rent than it would have been to buy,” explains Ellen.“Plus, the older that you are, the more difficult it is to get a mortgage. We would have had to have sold up and probably bought cash in Paris.”They arrived in Paris to begin their new lives in April 2017.Ellen and Joseph quickly set about getting to know their new community, while also traveling back and forth to Lonlay l’Abbaye to check on the renovation work.“Each year, we budgeted for a different phase of renovation,” says Ellen, before describing how they replaced the floors, walls, electrics, and the plumbing in the home.“We sought out good building materials and learned about ventilation and humidity issues in old stone houses.”Ellen goes on to point out that they were able to keep the original staircase inside the house, along with a wooden cabinet that had been in the study.While they had no choice but to get new windows and doors, they opted to replace them with replicas.“We like to think that the ghosts of the American GIs who helped to liberate this village would still recognize our house if they walked past it on the street,” she adds.Their goal was to both transform the tiny house into a liveable second home, and “restore it and leave it in good authentic condition for future generations.”“We wanted to keep it looking the way it was,” says Ellen. “We didn’t want to make any big changes.”She points out that any major changes to the outside of our Normandy house had to be approved by the local authorities and the Architectes de Batiments de France, officials concerned with protecting monuments and historic areas, due to the house’s proximity to the village’s 11th century abbey.But as the work continued to progress, the global pandemic hit, which led to renovations being halted for around two years and they were unable to travel to Normandy to visit.Thankfully, Ellen and Joseph were able to resume work on the home once restrictions were lifted and had completed the structural work and painting by December 2021. Their new windows were installed a year later.“We’re extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,” says Joseph, adding that they’re still working on the furnishing and the “decorative side of” things.They’d also eventually like to finish off the attic, which is currently used as storage space, and perhaps add a “half bath” up there.Ellen and Joseph estimate that they spent a total of 65,000 euros (about $70,000) on the building works and labor, and a further 5,000 euros on appliances and furniture.Now settled in France, they continue to flit back and forth between Paris and Lonlay l’Abbaye, stressing that they wouldn’t have it any other way.“It’s kind of like a French Brigadoon,” Joseph says of Lonlay l’Abbaye. “There’s a certain magic to the village. The history. The Abbey. And everything is just so close. You’re surrounded by these small hills with trees and grass.“It’s really a dramatic departure from living in a city like Los Angeles, New York or Paris.”They’ve formed strong friendships in Lonlay l’Abbaye and travel there by train “every five or six weeks,” staying at their “half house” for a few weeks, before heading back to their rented apartment in Paris.According to Joseph, the journey between the properties is a little over two and a half hours – their home is a 20-minute taxi ride from Flers station in Normandy.Both feel that life in France has done wonders for them, explaining that they walk a lot more, and eat much better due to the readily available fresh produce.“Our daughter thinks that we’ve definitely extended our lifespans by moving here,” says Ellen.“It just seems like a much healthier lifestyle for us.”Early on, they decided to “shoulder the responsibility” of learning French to make the transition easier, and stress that this has helped tremendously when it comes to forming bonds.“Now 90% of all speaking that we do is in French,” says Joseph. “Even though we are far from proficient in French, it’s just something that really, really matters to us. And of course, it makes a difference to other people as well.”However, the couple admit that they still occasionally find it daunting while attending a dinner with only French speakers who want to discuss philosophy.”They’ve had to adapt to some of the cultural differences between the French and Americans, and say that some have been easier to get used to than the others.For instance, Joseph points out that the French are “very, very private” in comparison to Americans, and perhaps less willing to share their lives.“They don’t invite you to their home right away,” he notes. “They don’t address you in the first person.“And that’s in contrast to the United States, where people are much more open with each other.”However, Ellen acknowledges that she’s always been “more comfortable with the French frame of mind” when it comes to relating to people and forming friendships, so this has suited her fine.“Maybe I’m just a little more introverted,” she notes.The couple, who chronicled the renovation in an online blog, have found life in France to be more affordable than in the US, noting that their health care costs and property taxes are considerably less now.In fact, they say the latter is roughly five to six times more on their properties in the States.“I think that’s one reason why a lot of Americans are thinking of Europe,” says Joseph. “Because of the cost of living, and the property taxes, but also the health care.”While they both miss living in southern California, neither has any regrets about leaving, admitting that it had become quite draining for them towards the end.“The traffic. The craziness. And then, to some extent, politically. The divisions in the US were very stressful,” says Ellen.“It’s not like we were having daily battles with people. But it was hard to watch. It’s still hard to watch the press from overseas and see how divided America is.“Gee, it doesn’t feel like the America we grew up in anymore.”They’ve gotten to explore much of France during their time there and have been enjoying learning about the different regions.“We fully appreciate how much the French enjoy and appreciate the seasons, the moments and the food,” says Ellen. “It’s a different cultural thing, but it’s something you can appreciate.”They say that they’d advise anyone considering a similar move to research their chosen destination carefully and refrain from trying to “replicate America” wherever they go.“Leave some of those expectations behind,” says Ellen. “Because you don’t want to just beat your head against a brick wall, and insist on thinking like an American. Saying ‘well, this should be easy, and they should do it this way.’”They acknowledge that spending so much time in France beforehand made things easier for them, stressing that things may have turned out differently if they had been less familiar with the country.“We have encountered that with some friends,” says Joseph. “You [can] get some real culture clash.”Ellen and Joseph currently have no plans to buy a place in Paris and say they’ll continue to move between their apartment in the 7th arrondissement and the countryside, perhaps spending eight months in Paris and four months in Lonlay l’Abbaye in the future.“It’s kind of an ideal situation where you have a place to get away to. To enjoy everything that Paris has to offer, but then to also get a break from the noise and the business.”Although they’ve returned to the US to spend time with their family and friends since relocating, they have no intention of returning to the country to live at this point, and can see themselves remaining in France for the rest of their lives.“There are moments, of course, when we do miss a place, or something from the United States,” says Joseph.“But this is a way of life. We’re trying to be Americans enjoying France and living here compatibly with the country.“But never forgetting that we are Americans and our country is very important to us.”",11813,https://www.cnn.com/travel/this-us-couple-bought-a-house-in-france-unseen/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204085256-01-us-couple-renovated-house-normandy.jpg?c=original&q=h_618,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country historic ruin condition change cash humidity continue staircase preparation settle anytime sought kind describes major rundown half enjoy century husband ideal moment strong brigadoon euro view leave bought address difficult matter labor ghost wooden course unable cost america extent child travel lift pack architectes total global compatibly train head station destination comparison move coast live friendship adapt originally late history southern estimate living private set possession blog proud bit agree oversee gee wall stone concerned latter turn life original beat noise step acknowledge away comfortable found inside surname meter quickly village proximity fully resume attic brick forget encounter tax europe funny planning spending city relate dinner retirement early shoulder fresh demolition plan online family situation rent painting work disclose friend instal lifespan arrondissement ventilation part replicate pandemic research building improvement overseas surround season goal week check approve considerably finally transform food arrange liveable authentic note decide speak york soldier prior french grow browsing batiments space stressful important normandy transition arrive lonlay france time miss familiar hit house differently instance buying show watch east summer halt flit google foremost compromise battle wind community lifestyle cabinet area chosen european reason lot available fly send share element explains unseen gi back manage complete opt hill insist return describe daughter side american discus advise stop long prospect continued countryside close culture plumbing joseph similar appreciate regularly homeland abbaye ride monument offer open start sentimental unfold property proficient remain learn inspector executive bath relocate refrain april resistance wonder extensive roughly journey buy cultural pretty explain acknowledges begin consider local due appliance departure probably basically california past definitely small craziness extend eat floor break home west explore finish idea form market vacation toy occasionally speaker press mind affair year hard spent tremendously follow electric paris attend inform tree chronicle negotiation december affordable extremely difference official rest introvert purchasing motion responsibility drain associate dramatic readily chance healthier tease make stay phase estate purchase exchange sell restore division apartment carefully united builder hour admit northern finalize charm visa month add progress different stress walk easy expectation find tiny base expensive lead fact state value mortgage place street seller liberate decision furnish feel big replace window magic photograph future process invite protect decorative material contrast real budget point angeles suit previously couple recognize budgetary world taxi intention account spend health storage restriction brought issue item mission authority fascination pair apply renovation daily implication eventually divide age regret square approach business frame choice daunt marry politically currently traffic structural flers,0.99615,0.12697875222212815,7.634649050371596,0.3887887315555856,0
CNN,Luis Rubiales accused by FA Chair of inappropriately touching England players at World Cup final,2023-12-07 09:17:00,Sammy Mncwabe,"English Football Association (FA) chair Debbie Hewitt accused Luis Rubiales of inappropriately touching England players at the FIFA World Cup final in Australia.The claims became public on Wednesday after FIFA published its reasons for banning the disgraced former Royal Spanish Football Federation president from “all football-related activities” for three years - a decision handed down in October.Hewitt, who was standing next to Rubiales at the post-match medal ceremony in August, made a series of claims noting his tone had been “unpleasant and unnecessarily aggressive” at being told by officials not to move to a more prominent position.According to FIFA, Hewitt said Rubiales “cupped and stroked the face of the English player Laura Coombs, which [the chair of the FA] thought was slightly odd and then he seemingly forcefully kissed the English player Lucy Bronze on her face.”Hewitt added she “felt deeply uncomfortable and embarrassed” at the way Rubiales greeted the Spanish players, which included tapping one on the bottom.She also noted Rubiales kissing Spanish player Jennifer Hermoso “fully and forcibly on the mouth,” which left her “slightly shocked” as it was clear to Hewitt the incident was not consensual.“The aggression and force seemed inappropriate and out of place,” added Hewitt.Rubiales, 46, had described the kiss as “mutual” – a claim Hermoso denied, saying she did not consent and was not respected.In his response, according to FIFA, Rubiales said it was “disgusting” Hewitt depicted him as “some sort of creep,” accused her of blatant “lies,” said she “speaks from ignorance” and that her overall statement “does a disservice to her position as chair of the English FA.”FIFA dismissed Rubiales’ assessment in conclusion, saying it had no reason to doubt Hewitt’s observations.It also noted that at no time did Rubiales explicitly apologize for his actions, instead merely stating they “should not have happened.”Rubiales was also seen grabbing his crotch while celebrating Spain’s win, the decision states.The disciplinary panel said Rubiales’ behavior was “inexcusable and unacceptable.”The Committee stressed “it was tempted to impose more severe sanctions in view of the seriousness and gravity of the incidents at stake as well as of the profound negative impact that the Respondents actions had on the image of FIFA, women’s football and women’s sport in general.“However and even with strong hesitations, the Disciplinary Committee was satisfied that the imposition of such a measure would serve the necessary deterrent effect upon the Respondent.”Rubiales is currently under investigation for “the crimes of sexual assault and coercion,” in a case being brought by Spanish prosecutors. He resigned in September after weeks of refusing to step down.He appeared in court last month after which the Spanish Prosecutor’s office said Rubiales had answered questions from the judge and all parties involved and denied the charges.In response to his three year ban, Rubiales said on social media in October that he was going to appeal FIFA’s decision “so that justice is served and the truth shines.”",3135,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/sport/luis-rubiales-england-players-world-intl-spt/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230915083212-01-luis-rubiales-court-091523.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,cupped inexcusable player assessment respondent reason behavior seriousness september disciplinary social response fully royal investigation case justice win mutual stake public odd doubt judge force hewitt celebrate make resign disservice prosecutor party england touch court hand tempt ban disgust coercion spanish described sort instead stroke imposition tap appeal creep refuse hermoso strong unnecessarily view rubiales satisfied inappropriately uncomfortable assault chair president hesitation spain effect ceremony month question add panel conclusion deterrent stress kiss forcefully shine medal told debbie negative football profound incident mouth week state crime grab place serve wednesday medium unpleasant image decision consent embarrass aggressive deny fifa note move laura accord impose august cup position blatant include luis jennifer activity federation october impact left measure association world stand depict severe answer woman disgrace english forcibly involve time action statement brought ignorance final slightly office seemingly truth sanction prominent gravity sexual accuse former tone year publish aggression speaks claim bronze step shock inappropriate crotch deeply explicitly apologize sport clear felt currently dismiss lie official greet series coombs committee lucy,-0.7388,0.09569377990430622,11.501511423550085,0.4294973544973545,0
CNN,British Foreign Secretary David Cameron urges US Congress to pass Ukraine aid package,2023-12-07 12:03:00,Rob Picheta,"Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron has urged US lawmakers to “lift the morale” of Ukraine by passing an aid package for Kyiv that has become entangled in Republican quarrelling.Cameron, a former British prime minister, told CNN during a trip to Washington, DC, on Thursday that the US is “the lynchpin” of the Western coalition backing Ukraine’s fight against Russia.His intervention comes a day after Republicans in the Senate blocked foreign aid from advancing in protest over the package’s lack of changes to border and immigration policy.“Most of the people I met on the Hill yesterday support backing Ukraine, because it’s the right thing to do,” Cameron told CNN, though he avoided commenting on Republicans’ demands on immigration. “This is an investment into their success, and the worst thing in the world would be to allow Putin a win in Ukraine – not just because that would be bad in itself, but (because) he’d be back for more.”The Senate has struggled for weeks as it tied immigration and border security policy – one of Congress’ historically most divisive issues – to a legislative package for sending aid to key US allies, among them Israel and Ukraine.Republicans’ insistence on changes to border policy have led to increased tension on Capitol Hill, including a classified briefing earlier this week that devolved into a closed-door shouting match.Cameron met with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday as part of a two-day charm offensive aimed at reaffirming support for Ukraine. On Thursday, he will meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.“There’s no doubt that America coming forward with this package will lift the morale of Ukrainians, (and) it will make sure Europe focuses on doing more,” Cameron said. “If you add up military and civilian (support), European nations are doing more than the US, and I think that’s important and quite right.”Cameron was Britain’s prime minister for six years before resigning in 2016, in the wake of voters’ decision to leave the European Union, a move that he opposed. He unexpectedly returned to politics last month when he accepted the role of foreign secretary.Britain has taken a leading role in providing support and assistance to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The UK has invested £9.3 billion ($11.7 billion) in military, humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine since the start of the war, it said this week.But tensions among Republicans in Washington over continued military assistance threaten to create a major crack in Ukraine’s Western alliance.US President Joe Biden on Wednesday urged Congress to resolve negotiations over the future of Ukraine funding, saying “petty partisan politics can’t get in the way” of aid for Kyiv.“History’s going to judge harshly those who turn their back on freedom’s cause,” the president said. “We can’t let Putin win.”His administration’s package includes about $60 billion in aid toward Ukraine’s defenses against Russia, with the rest going toward Israel’s war with Hamas, security in Taiwan and funding for operations at the US-Mexico border. Top Republicans, weary of adding more to the $111 billion the US has already sent to Ukraine, have asked that any further funding be tied to major immigration-related policy changes.Cameron also reiterated British support for Israel in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attacks, but urged the country to abide by international law in its response. He backed remarks by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who told CNN on Wednesday that Israel is taking some “important steps” to better protect civilians during its offensive in southern Gaza.Cameron said Blinken, whom he will meet on Thursday, made “a series of points about how Israel is trying to behave differently in the south of Gaza to the north of Gaza, and I think that is right, and we should continue to make those points to them.”“Ultimately the long-term security of Israel does depend not only on their own armed strength and fortitude, but also on having Palestinians able to live in peace and security as well,” Cameron said.A humanitarian crisis has unfolded in Gaza, where Israeli air and ground assaults have left Palestinians displaced and in dire need of food, supplies and medical care.Cameron has visited Israel and Ukraine in his first weeks as foreign secretary. He resisted calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, telling CNN: “If we leave Hamas in charge of even a part of Gaza, there will never be a two-state solution because you can’t expect Israel to live next to a group of people that want to do October 7 all over again.”",4603,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/europe/david-cameron-ukraine-cnn-gbr-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230627130758-rob-picheta-headshot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country european funding send increase depend response change top hill back return win continue reaffirm russia resolve urge tension doubt resign charge major continued economic britain ceasefire mike western leave antony ukrainian aim lynchpin assault politics struggle partisan start law taiwan day told key cnn demand devolve yesterday legislative senate america entangle unfolded displace resist lift wednesday avoid biden petty move package prime live military nation role history gaza historically southern october advance supply operation secretary north republican congress wake abide international unexpectedly israeli peace border speaker turn fight former backing remark year lack step palestinian dire passing shout negotiation rest divisive visit meet defense threaten dc trip strength attack judge make europe voter blinken ally aid forward hamas policy foreign administration expect crisis air uk tie medical success israel support charm president investment lawmaker month add humanitarian minister part johnson offensive comment group accepted david reiterate ground week lead state crack union decision food focus earlier future protect include important cameron kyiv point left weary world protest solution february behave coalition thursday putin capitol joe issue washington harshly invest house immigration differently provide invasion insistence ultimately immediate create intervention oppose block arm freedom fortitude ukraine south classify billion security briefing call british civilian assistance series,-0.2763,0.4562242016076472,9.527194570135745,0.38642583470169667,0
CNN,"As Western unity on Ukraine falters, Putin eyes a slow-burn win",2023-12-07 09:12:00,Nick Paton Walsh,"This is the moment Russian President Vladimir Putin has been waiting for: when he doesn’t really need to do much, and can call it a win.The static frontlines in Ukraine are slowly hardening as the snow deepens. In Kyiv, there is a palpable sense of once-insurmountable morale ebbing slightly. There is open talk of disagreement between the commander-in-chief and the chief of staff – Volodymyr Zelensky and Valery Zaluzhny.Russia is no longer losing the war, or the terrain it seized, and so Ukraine is definitely not winning it. Across European capitals, elections loom and even the farmers of stalwart ally Poland are picking quarrels with their Ukrainian neighbours.In the United States, Senate Republicans blocked a legislative package including $60 billion in aid for Ukraine from advancing Wednesday evening, amid a standoff with the Democrats over US border and immigration policy.In an attempt to break the impasse, US President Joe Biden had appealed earlier Wednesday for Congress not to let “petty partisan politics” get in the way of aid for Kyiv. “History’s going to judge harshly those who turn their back on freedom’s cause,” the president said. “We can’t let Putin win.”Britain’s newly appointed Foreign Secretary David Cameron was due to speak Thursday alongside US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, as the United Kingdom, too, urges continued international support for Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion.The unity of purpose and intent - so remarkable for the first 21 months of Europe’s most consequential event since the fall of the Berlin Wall - had always been an outlier. More disarray and disunity looms.In Washington, the uncertainty on display is more baffling. Congress’s reluctance to provide urgently needed aid is often billed as concerned Republicans not wanting to drag the US into another conflict. But the aid is meant precisely to prevent that: to ensure that Ukraine can keep fighting Moscow, rather than permit Putin to advance near enough NATO’s borders that the US is forced to fight for its allies in person, not via proxy.A gentle blame game has begun, with extensive articles outlining why the Ukrainian counteroffensive failed to deliver the long-telegraphed results it needed. The Washington Post quoted anonymous US officials explaining Kyiv moved too late, or listened too little.Ukrainian officials must still marvel at their allies expecting them to pull off complex military assaults minus the air superiority without which a NATO army would not even get out of bed.It is a slow drain of vigor that Putin has surely long wished for. And it is a remarkable turnaround for an authoritarian leader who barely six months ago faced an open but short-lived rebellion from henchman Yevgeny Prigozhin.Prigozhin is dead, killed with his other top Wagner figures in a mysterious plane crash. Moscow is rich on oil money. The prisons are filling the trenches with seemingly inexhaustible cannon fodder. Russia’s military has got back on its feet and has, for the most part, so far held back Ukraine’s counteroffensive – along with the billions of dollars of NATO training and arms that went into it.The frontlines tell three tales. To the west, Ukraine has made a plucky - if hard to sustain - dive across the Dnipro River to create a bridgehead and threatens to attack Russia’s access to Crimea from the west. The nearby city of Kherson pays the price, shelled daily, and ghostly. Ukraine may see luck on this front, but will need a lot of it to make a difference and keep its forces resupplied.To the center, the frontlines below Zaporizhzhia, for months the key focus of Ukraine’s attacks towards the city of Melitopol, are largely unchanged. A breakthrough here was the hope - the key result the West and Kyiv could have called a victory, cutting Russia’s mainland off from annexed Crimea - but it may not happen. The snows and darkness ahead will slow fighting further.And to the east, a more troubling rhythm is forming around the town of Avdiivka. Of little strategic value, it is a symbol of Russia’s limitless tolerance of pain and casualties to achieve a basic, grinding victory. Its forces are slowly surrounding the town, much like they did with the city of Bakhmut earlier this year. They may take it, and lose thousands doing so. And the fear is that this is how they will move forward, throughout Ukraine. One tiny, costly victory at a time.The biggest advantage Putin has is a West out of ideas - an alliance which saw its main strategy with Kyiv fail, and now thinks that more-of-the-same aid is essentially futile as the war cannot be decisively won.Soon, Putin may appear more amenable to negotiations, and Europe may nudge Kyiv towards them for peace of mind. Yet this is despite most Western leaders being acutely aware that Putin cannot be trusted, and that Moscow uses diplomacy as a useful trick to advance its military aims. Any peace deal might last just long enough to allow Putin to refit, re-equip and then come back for more of Ukraine.A victory in the US presidential election next year for Donald Trump would throw into this highly dangerous mix for European security a US president with an inexplicable fondness for the Kremlin head. Trump boasts he could forge a peace deal in Ukraine within 24 hours. He will be lucky if it even lasts that long.So where do we go now? What does Ukraine do? First, the West must drop its fear of a humiliated Russia. Putin has shown - after attacks on the Russian mainland, a failed coup, and multiple ships in his Black Sea Fleet upping sticks to the safety of Russia’s main Black Sea coast - that he is not interested in escalation. He is struggling to defeat his weak neighbor and cannot take on NATO in full. The same goes for nuclear war; Putin has shown he is a pragmatic survivor, not a madman bent on global apocalypse.Second, the West must arm Ukraine to the full – and fast. The approach of supplying a slow drip of weapons has proven catastrophic: the US Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), the M1 Abrams tanks - they arrive, but too late to make much difference.Third, the West must make it clear that no peace deal with Russia can let it maintain a land corridor across southeastern Ukraine between the Russian mainland and Crimea. That will deny Moscow of something it can call a strategic victory.But most importantly, Europe and the US must retain the conviction this is an existential fight for Western security. Upon its outcome rest China’s ambitions towards Taiwan, NATO’s own border security, and permitting a leader indicted for war crimes -to get away with it.Putin cannot win, or else the price will be paid perhaps not only by this generation, but those to come.",6716,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/europe/ukraine-western-unity-faltering-putin-intl-cmd/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/181120154047-nick-paton-walsh-2018.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,slow european drip rebellion zelensky army nato wagner survivor lot baffling fall top deepens quote back ebb threatens win russia outcome pull russian urge strategic reluctance weapon rhythm ahead mysterious long continued lose basic intent catastrophic kremlin unchanged appeal britain mix luck moment alliance slowly berlin happen full humiliate diplomacy western static zaporizhzhia china antony ukrainian bridgehead aim neighbor trick assault system politics open wish ship front struggle partisan maintain deal taiwan terrain amid meant key precisely multiple legislative wait senate trust counteroffensive outline game crime stalwart extensive bill wednesday global retain mainland explain biden head petty begin interested deliver deny symbol move package coast due casualty event oil foot southeastern capital prevent military late avdiivka price listen definitely crash drop history unity dnipro nudge advance supply fast madman yevgeny loom surely break disunity snow barely secretary indict appoint figure west uncertainty authoritarian complex republican talk congress urgently idea marvel form international defeat coup wall concerned peace border ago center frontlines turn safety fight pick mind kherson rich vladimir year hard tolerance cannon nuclear palpable conviction harden post dead abrams vigor away decisively refit futile held result standoff advantage negotiation clear missile difference official leader escalation rest lucky despite amenable person drain dollar dive nearby dangerous fodder kill aware attack shell town judge force essentially make europe blinken chief ally forge fail farmer aid forward grind city victory melitopol foreign minus henchman expect largely air quarrel paid achieve access united plucky fear hour seize consequential proven fleet importantly support president article month land inexhaustible part ambition prison david turnaround annexed presidential purpose black river tactical tiny highly surround trench state value fondness bent trump bakhmut display permit valery limitless acutely remarkable sustain staff big ghostly volodymyr speak focus earlier pay anonymous include disarray plane inexplicable alongside superiority poland drag costly throw cameron disagreement stick kyiv tank kingdom outlier money arrive blame existential ensure longer corridor crimea thursday cut putin impasse joe gentle washington harshly pain generation slightly immigration seemingly newly moscow provide show donald weak training east create daily darkness thousand election block boast arm hope battle freedom fill conflict atacms ukraine trouble strategy approach breakthrough attempt billion security call pragmatic democrat,-0.9789,0.5360333531864203,9.120941176470588,0.40070491264687685,0
CNN,"Opinion: My students aren’t debating ‘genocide,’ they’re looking for the freedom to learn",2023-12-07 11:47:00,,"I wish more of the people who are so obsessed with campus speech could actually focus on the kind of speech that really matters for college students and those of us tasked with educating them.In a world driven by sound bites, social media, secret recordings of professors and students and even elected officials demanding yes/no answers, suspicion and division are building, rendering it seemingly impossible to have the difficult conversations in the classroom that always, in my experience, lie at the core of any great education.This isn’t a new problem. During the war in Gaza, it’s gotten harder than ever.Earlier this week, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce called in the presidents of Harvard, MIT and Penn to grill them about campus antisemitism. The Republicans on the committee, led by Elise Stefanik (Republican, New York), insisted on simplistic responses and instead received nuance and caution, though all three presidents made it clear that there were lines that can’t be crossed without consequences. The hearing has fed a public outcry, doing exactly the thing that I feared – making it harder to meet the moment through, among other things, education.Stefanik was careful, asking about whether calling for genocide of Jews, generically, was harassment and violated campus policies. Columnist Kevin Drum argued this was a deliberate choice intending to trap the presidents, because in fact hateful speech not specifically directed at individuals is often protected. But I think it’s beside the point.No one should be calling for genocide and I want my university leaders to be clear about that, even if their bad-faith questioner asks them about “policy.” But while the show in Congress might be good politics, it doesn’t reflect what I’m hearing on my own campus in the place that matters most to me: the classroom.On October 9, according to my syllabus, my plan was to talk about the history of the Vikings. I’m teaching a first-year seminar on how historical narratives get made, reading everything from the densest scholarship to the silliest fiction, and focusing on the European Middle Ages.But after the terrorist attacks on 10/7, I knew my students would need to talk. So I let the Vikings wait and instead sat down on the desk at the front of the class and I told them I hoped that as a historian, this would be a good place to process what was happening in Israel and Gaza, a community where they could safely admit ignorance and ask questions, especially about the history.I told them I would admit ignorance too, since I’m a medievalist, not an expert in the 20th century, let alone the 21st. They already knew that I am Jewish and I have never hid my politics – it’s hard to hide politics from students when you write political op-eds – but instead always labor when I teach to build a community where we can talk about the hard stuff and often disagree while remaining a community.It was, on that day, filled with hard talk, confusing talk, because history – all history, but especially this history – is complicated and doesn’t support simple ideological positions.A few weeks later, we got to the history of the Crusades. We started with a massacre in 1099 CE, as the European armies breached the walls of Jerusalem and slaughtered inhabitants taking shelter in Muslim holy places, but we ended in a nuanced place, reading sources and scholarship that showed both conflict and co-existence, talking about the ways that people have choices about how they react, what they do, how they understand the world. The political implications weren’t subtle, and again we leaned into them as best as I could guide us.Then right before Thanksgiving, we took up the long and terrible history of the blood libel, or the conspiracy theory – entirely false – that Jews abduct and ritually murder Christian children. Its origins seem to lie in the twelfth century, but extend throughout the Middle Ages and beyond. Most recently, as writer Talia Lavin documented for The New Republic, the blood libel has now manifested within the right-wing conspiracy theory QAnon claiming a secret cabal of elites (they mean Jews, mostly) are extracting adrenochrome (an anti-blood clotting chemical; don’t ask conspiracy theories to make sense) from tortured children in order to attain immortality.The recent incarnations of the old and vile myth likewise raised political questions, pointing to the duration and spread of antisemitic myths over centuries. We talked about why this kind of thinking was so hard to stamp out and how easy it was for people to fall into or spread antisemitic tropes unintentionally.This history, I suggested, puts pressure on those who want to criticize Israel to work actively to avoid participating in or being co-opted by antisemites today. It was, in many ways, the hardest of the three classes for me, trying to be so clear that I respected my students’ rights to take any position on the war that they wanted to, but to argue that they needed to know the history and let that inform their pathway forward.These are the conversations that I believe matter the most on college campuses. They are certainly the kinds of experiences I pursued as an undergraduate and have spent the last three decades trying to foster with my students. The ones that take place in classrooms intentionally built to make the hard discussions possible. Where else but in the classroom can we even aspire to do this?Certainly not on social media. Certainly not in slogans printed or written on posters. And certainly not in the Congressional hearings. But it’s the latter kinds of speech that dominate the conversation because they are public, simplistic, and allow people to score political points. What’s more, it skews the conversation. People mistakenly think it is the whole conversation.But if we really care about campus speech (and plenty of the politicians, I fear, don’t), then we must – or anyway in my classroom I must – always return to the question: How do we make the hard conversation possible?A simple question. No easy answers.",6080,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/opinions/harvard-penn-mit-college-presidents-on-antisemitism-genocide-perry/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206145654-exp-antisemitism-university-congress-testimony-fst120612pseg1-cnni-u-s-00004426.png?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,european hid harvard raise army fall response respect insist return blood writer jewish conversation line sound public intend teach kind breach expert suggest core long vile pursue origin century stefanik thanksgiving undergraduate secret moment historical entirely argue happen campus chemical antisemites built plenty classroom caution react muslim politics twelfth holy wish difficult front matter receive hardest start slaughter put labor day seminar kevin write told decade lean cabal syllabus remain nuance demand historian congressional wait grill child duration actively simple mistakenly manifest poster terrible medium viking questioner avoid nuanced medievalist conspiracy narrative obsess inhabitant accord cross fed false elite adrenochrome trope political bite extend experience history gaza antisemitism october tasked build careful answer deliberate student guide harassment university republican congress talk spread wall latter print knew workforce christian hard spent understand claim direct sat specifically intentionally talia driven inform clear desk official leader middle massacre reflect shelter social meet speech politician hide scholarship silliest genocide attack make educate discussion possible reading policy fiction jerusalem college violate professor antisemitic division pathway instead plan recent fear drum recording admit believe work terrorist israel subtle recently support education pressure president incarnation question densest easy criticize complicate myth building hateful clot lead week fact suspicion participate consequence place elect stamp elise penn focus york simplistic position abduct slogan outcry process protect torture aspire attain document republic foster libel safely point skews world generically murder impossible class ideological individual render score order disagree lavin hop ritually house ignorance especially today seemingly problem show columnist stuff confuse crusade qanon implication harder dominate theory jew hearing fill source conflict age asks great choice community likewise call lie extract trap committee,-0.99135,0.4934210526315789,9.549477351916376,0.4308812329645663,0
CNN,Tennis star Nick Kyrgios signs deal to join OnlyFans,2023-12-07 09:00:00,Matias Grez,"Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios has signed a deal to join video subscription company OnlyFans in a move that the 28-year-old describes as a “no brainer.”Kyrgios is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining players on the tour, but his behavior at times on the court has made him a polarizing figure.He reached his first grand slam singles final at Wimbledon last year, losing in four sets to Novak Djokovic, and won his first grand slam doubles title at the Australian Open alongside compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis.“Launching an OnlyFans was a no-brainer,” Kyrgios said in a statement on Thursday. “They are revolutionising social media and I wanted to be a part of that. Athletes can no longer just show up on the court or the field, we have to show up online too.“I want to create, produce, direct and own content. That’s the future. I’ve been speaking to my fans directly for years and I know what they want to see.“Of course, there’ll be tennis balls involved, tips, tricks and behind the scenes, but also they’ll get to see all different sides of me. Gaming, tattoos, my intimate side – it’s all on the table and I’ll be bringing fans along for the ride!”OnlyFans began as a social media platform for anyone wanting to produce videos and photos to share with subscribing fans, but the UK-based company quickly became known for sexually explicit and other adult content.In August 2021, OnlyFans announced it would ban sexually explicit content, under pressure from its banking partners, but the company reversed the decision days later following a backlash from content creators.Sex workers said they had helped create the company’s success and popularity only to be left in the dust. OnlyFans said it was eventually able to secure funding to continue allowing all manner of content on its platform.OnlyFans told CNN on Thursday that it has paid out over $10 billion to creators since it was founded in 2016.According to OnlyFans’ most recent earnings statement, the platform’s 239 million users spent more than $5.5 billion in 2022, up from $4.8 billion in 2021.OnlyFans takes a 20% cut of users’ payments, with the content creators receiving the remaining 80%, the company said in the statement.Kyrgios will likely have plenty of time to keep his OnlyFans account updated as he continues to struggle with injuries.After missing all four grand slams in 2023 with wrist, knee and foot injuries, Kyrgios looks set to miss his home Australian Open in January after being left off the entry list.However, 22-time grand slam singles champion Rafael Nadal has been included on the entry list after missing the majority of 2022 due to an injury sustained at the Australian Open.Nadal will make his long-awaited return to tennis at the Brisbane International in January.",2769,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/sport/nick-kyrgios-signs-deal-to-join-onlyfans-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207103358-nick-kyrgios-only-fans.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,user player funding ball behavior payment quickly revolutionise social double grand share return manner continue majority nick photo backlash tennis make side describes court launch ban lose table popularity athlete paid adult australian wimbledon online recent ride content secure success explicit plenty onlyfans trick subscribe compatriot company pressure directly open banking kyrgios struggle receive different deal part day creator rafael told course cnn title remain game reach wrist join medium tip update decision sexually subscription injury sustain entry begin partner move speak slam dust august future due platform include foot champion worker video alongside tour brisbane left produce nadal reverse longer set tattoo account million home thanasi announce djokovic sign involve time thursday scene cut miss statement international novak final star polarize show intimate earnings entertain create knee bring year field list spent direct eventually undoubtedly follow single billion found january,0.81875,0.0,9.591802656546484,0.4230496453900709,0
CNN,‘My Life With the Walter Boys’ again turns young love into a ‘team’ sport,2023-12-07 09:00:00,Brian Lowry,"The latest iteration of a genre that has found success on Netflix in the “To All the Boys” movies and Amazon in “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” “My Life With the Walter Boys” is a shamelessly derivative series that sets up an orphaned girl facing a choice between dreamy brothers. “Team Cole” or “Team Alex?” For those prone to choosing sides, this should be right up their alleys.Poor teenage Jackie (Nikki Rodriguez) loses her family with scant explanation regarding what happened, but the tragedy means that the New York resident with Ivy League ambitions is abruptly shipped off to a ranch in Colorado to live with her mother’s friend Katherine (Sarah Rafferty), Katherine’s husband George (Marc Blucas) and their full house of hormonally preoccupied children.Almost immediately (because seriously, when the set-up is this obvious, why waste time?), Jackie is thrown together with the tousle-haired girl-magnet Cole (Noah LaLonde), a one-time star quarterback whose leg injury has left him aimless and who insists on calling Jackie “New York” as a nickname; and Alex (Ashby Gentry), his more sensitive brother, whose longing stares at her seem designed to knock the petite new arrival off her feet, assuming Cole’s earthy charms don’t do it first.Granted, there’s a lot more going on than that in this youthful soap opera, which shares the outdoorsy qualities of “Virgin River” (another unlikely Netflix staple) or “Yellowstone” with the teen-drama aspects of every show that the CW cancelled in its under-new-management makeover. All of which is to say there should be an audience for this 10-episode season, which throws in mini-dramas surrounding the other siblings, various classmates and the parents’ finances as garnishes to what’s clearly intended to be the main event.Adapted from the novel by Ali Novak by the company behind “The Kissing Both” movies, “My Life With the Walter Boys” only occasionally rises above its simple underpinnings, like when Jackie questions mean-girl Erin (Alisha Newton) about why somebody with her attributes would settle for being Cole’s part-time squeeze, saying guys in New York would die to be with her.For the most part, though, the series follows a blueprint that’s comfortable in its predictability and calibrated to pluck all the customary notes, at times a little too self-consciously so, not that it’s likely to matter when the casting works, as this mostly does.“My Life With the Walter Boys” isn’t bashful about wanting to be the next “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” and it probably will be. Because while hanging out with the Walters brood might not be especially original, there are few more tried-and-true formulas than the combination of scenic wide-open spaces and turning young love/romance into a “team” sport.“My Life With the Walter Boys” premieres December 7 on Netflix.",2828,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/entertainment/my-life-with-the-walter-boys-review/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231204160302-01-my-life-with-the-walter-boys-review.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,outdoorsy petite explanation lot longing combination share genre alisha hormonally hang intend cw settle quarterback derivative side ivy stare cole movie colorado prone netflix katherine predictability noah husband audience garnish scant iteration happen family full abruptly sensitive success marc work ashby yellowstone friend obvious thrown charm dreamy brother company choose rodriguez regard ship leg question calibrate matter opera part ambition classmate kiss staple cancel river shamelessly virgin mother season surround nikki pluck simple orphan finance newton cast pretty youthful injury squeeze walter parent customary note insists york soap live aspect earthy bashful foot probably teenage league sarah alex lalonde late space aimless throw loses girl left arrival rafferty premiere set boy tragedy george time blueprint makeover young design novak gentry house erin guy ranch star especially scenic underpinnings jackie occasionally show turn blucas brood life original assume summer attribute immediately resident preoccupy formula waste follow quality knock comfortable nickname rise found choice sibling call december series amazon team,0.85195,0.0,9.241449275362317,0.4913261535212755,0
CNN,Biden administration takes more steps aimed at lowering health care costs,2023-12-07 12:54:00,Tami Luhby,"The Biden administration Thursday announced five new measures that seek to lower health care costs by promoting competition.Reducing health care prices is one of President Joe Biden’s key platforms as he seeks to build momentum in the 2024 presidential campaign. The president has repeatedly pointed to the steps he and congressional Democrats have already taken, including allowing Medicare to negotiate certain drug prices for the first time and capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month. However, few Americans are aware of these provisions, a recent KFF poll shows.The measures announced Thursday, which are largely incremental, seek to counter the power and practices of big health care companies.The Commerce and Health and Human Services departments released a proposed framework for agencies concerning the exercise of march-in rights, which enable the federal government to license drugs or inventions backed by taxpayer funds to other parties if the invention is not made accessible to the public. The proposed framework specifies for the first time that price can be a factor in determining the accessibility of a taxpayer-funded drug or other invention.The government has never used its march-in authority, which was enabled by the Bayh-Dole Act.“Fundamentally, we are establishing that price can now be a factor in determining when the federal government can march in to ensure that we have lower prices,” Neera Tanden, the White House domestic policy adviser, told reporters.Certain Democratic lawmakers have pushed for greater use of march-in rights to counter high drug prices. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading proponent, praised the administration’s effort.“President Biden is taking a critical and much-needed step to lower costs and rein in the abuses of the pharmaceutical industry, which has raked in billions of dollars by jacking up prices for drugs that taxpayers paid to develop,” she said in a statement. “Today’s announcement means that drug companies will no longer have a free pass to hike up prices for life-saving drugs that benefitted from taxpayer dollars.”But the administration’s proposal has already drawn criticism from the pharmaceutical industry and at least one Republican senator.“So-called ‘march-in’ authority, codified in the 1980 bipartisan Bayh-Dole Act, is intended to be a safeguard if good-faith efforts aren’t being made by a private sector partner to commercialize federally-funded research,” the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, said in a statement. “It was never intended to be a government price setting policy.”Both PhRMA and Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, pointed to a 2002 letter in the Washington Post by former Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana and former GOP Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.The senators wrote “the purpose of our act was to spur the interaction between public and private research so that patients would receive the benefits of innovative science sooner … Bayh-Dole did not intend that government set prices on resulting products.”The Biden administration’s announcement could harm the development of new medicines, both PhRMA and Cassidy said.“This kind of short-sighted decision would kill American health care innovation and deny millions of Americans future lifesaving cures and treatments,” Cassidy said in a statement.The Biden administration also unveiled several efforts aimed at countering anticompetitive practices by big health care companies.Some are aimed at private equity firms, which have been buying up physician practices, nursing homes and other health care providers. Officials are concerned that corporate owners are “maximizing their profits at the expense of patients’ health and safety, while increasing costs for patients and taxpayers alike,” according to the administration’s fact sheet.The Justice Department, along with HHS and the Federal Trade Commission, will seek input on how the growing involvement of private equity and other corporations in health care is affecting Americans. The agencies will use the information to identify areas for future regulation and enforcement prioritization and will work together on various competition policy initiatives.The three agencies will also share data to help antitrust enforcers identify companies that engage in a series of relatively small acquisitions that lead to market consolidation – known as a “roll up” strategy – that might otherwise evade review.Meanwhile, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is releasing for the first time ownership data on Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Centers, as it already has for hospitals, nursing homes, hospice providers and home health agencies. Making this information available helps in identifying common owners with histories of poor performance, evaluating the connection between ownership and changes in costs and outcomes and enabling analysis on how market consolidation affects consumers.And CMS will solicit information from the public early next year about Medicare Advantage insurance plans, which now enroll about half of Medicare beneficiaries and are expected to receive more than $7 trillion from the federal government over the next decade. It’s the latest step in the agency’s effort to understand the impact of Medicare Advantage’s growing enrollment on consumers and care.This story has been updated with additional information.",5504,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/biden-health-care-costs/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206191603-joe-biden-120623.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,available taxpayer increase treatment insurance change top share trillion back corporation manufacturer outcome maximize public intend profit anticompetitive owner elizabeth patient critical kind develop american invention half promote firm competition service free agency power momentum qualify accessible nursing spur abuse enforcement effort tanden aim rural company poor practice enrollment receive labor adviser senator write told decade cost key democratic release congressional incremental senate america harm push poll bill praise story repeatedly department biden cap partner fundamentally deny framework equity accord proponent information benefit platform establish beneficiary common expense prioritization late acquisition price small commerce safeguard history medicine drawn measure louisiana commission build corporate private set involvement million home hospice exercise republican market specifies concerned evade neera center safety former performance rein year sooner understand step provision post medicare act hhs result advantage antitrust innovation relatively official jacking pension warren dollar ownership birch solicit justice enforcer kill negotiate aware party provider codify make massachusetts factor bob unveiled cassidy analysis policy administration series expect kff interaction largely concern early rake enable paid plan criticism recent industry announcement work license campaign education president determine month lawmaker science counter indiana roll gop physician data presidential purpose research regulation cm lead cure fact proposal trade hike seek low update identify decision high big sector consolidation consumer accessibility insulin future affect federal include grow hospital innovative fund connection engage commercialize enroll point impact government pharmaceutical phrma ensure longer bayh dole medicaid health announce time thursday bipartisan joe statement washington additional house domestic authority today buying alike letter federally lifesaving development propose march white strategy human billion input great area evaluate democrat committee,0.9866,0.1635174418604651,13.821545157780196,0.33644209956709953,0
CNN,The meaning behind Pantone’s Color of the Year 2024,2023-12-07 08:30:00,Leah Dolan,"If we could visualize the year ahead, what color would it be? The abstract thought is an annual consideration for the experts at the Pantone Color Institute, who trawl through high-fashion runways, interior design trends, pop culture moments and human psychology to make their pick.According to their research, the shade that will come to define 2024 is “Peach Fuzz” — a light, fruity tone that conjures peace and serenity. “We’re going through a lot of turmoil in our lives, and we have a need for a color that’s nurturing,” Pantone color specialist Leatrice Eisman told CNN over video call. “It’s a warm and cozy shade. And it’s very tactile. We feel that at a time like this, tactility is really important — to touch other people and gather them into our homes.”Peach tones have been a fixture of the Spring-Summer 2024 runways, particularly in Milan with Italian houses such as Gucci, Jil Sander and Sportmax leading the way. At the Oscars Vanity Fair Afterparty in March, Hilary Duff wore a lingerie-inspired, peach-hued Dolce & Gabbana gown. Shortly after, Uma Thurman attended the Women Making History Awards in a Prada Fall-Winter 2023 gabardine dress in the same color.But the research process for color selection is cumulative, and it’s not enough to just look at the latest iterations of peach, says Eisman. For Spring-Summer 2016, king of greige Giorgio Armani released a memorable collection where the majority of pieces skewed salmon over the label’s signature suit-gray. The last time we saw Beyoncé at the Met Gala, also in 2016, we saw her in peach. While the puff-sleeved, embellished latex Givenchy gown was criticized by the public at the time, it was a key moment for Eisman and the Pantone team. But what does a red carpet moment in 2016 have to do with the zeitgeist of 2024? “We felt that (Beyoncé’s look) was something that really still had life today,” she said. “If we see it in 2016, and we feel that it’s a valuable idea that’s going to grow, we draw on that idea as well. We don’t forget what we’ve seen before.”Peachy pop culture moments did grow, too. Since then, the color has been worn out on the red carpet by a number of key players. Florence Pugh wore a Spring-Summer 2020 Chloé dress in the shade for the French premiere of “Little Women,” while Zoë Kravitz’s peach Oscar de la Renta column gown worn to the 2020 SAG Awards made headlines for its classic, vintage appeal.“We think of peach as being a significantly nostalgic color,” said Eisman. “More frequently a woman’s color. And yet it has been adapted and gathered into men’s wardrobes and surroundings. I think that speaks to the modernity of the shade.”For visual evidence of the burgeoning male appreciation of peach, look no further than Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s Oscars 2023 ensemble. His tuxedo jacket from Dolce & Gabbana was the perfect shade of Peach Fuzz, and in an intrinsically tactical satin fabric. And for inspiration on how to further update the tone to modern tastes, take a cue from Rihanna and the peach leather mini dress she wore while heavily pregnant in 2022 at the Off—White runway show in Paris.This year also marks the 25th anniversary of Pantone’s Color of the Year initiative. The color psychology behind Eisman and her team’s last three selections have been rooted in endurance, optimism, courage and strength, referencing our continually turbulent times. But capturing the collective mood even in an atmosphere of confusion and anxiety is familiar territory for Pantone.Afterall, the first Color of the Year was Sky Blue in 1999. “It was wonderful, hopeful, all of those wonderful things you feel when thinking about the future. But there was also that fear that all the clocks were going to stop,” she said. “So that was our challenge. But for us it was simple: the color of the sky, the color of the heavens, what lies in front of us.”If 1999 was about embracing the unknown and engaging some blue-sky thinking, Pantone prescribes a quiet retreat inwards for 2024. “In 2023, we celebrated coming out of the malaise of the last year,” said Eisman. “We feel that next year, with so much whirling in the atmosphere around us, there will be a need for some quiet, some peace, some respite, and that’s what that Peach Fuzz will be for us.”",4262,https://www.cnn.com/style/pantone-color-of-the-year-2024-peach-fuzz/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/pantone-split.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,player significantly beyoncé lot gabardine mini appreciation inspiration gucci gown thurman pugh interior public dolce celebrate courage expert ahead touch stop jil trawl annual culture draw define warm moment renta florence jacket turbulent shortly color front sag mood told atmosphere particularly key cnn column visual release nostalgic whirl specialist peach simple cue dress oscar root giorgio leather pregnant trend pop kravitz evidence heavily king adapt sky cumulative retreat afterparty late video embellish cozy history anniversary heaven modern red conjures idea design malaise peace zoë reference light tactile embrace taste life unknown serenity year ensemble speaks skewed sander armani attend clock headline felt surroundings abstract rihanna team quiet fixture fruity rock prada inwards endurance collection runway pantone majority number male strength burgeon forget continually visualize label fair make selection optimism italian nurture iteration eisman peachy classic vintage prescribes valuable fear wonderful confusion salmon worn consideration mark hilary collective satin sportmax zeitgeist blue johnson fuzz criticize research tactical latex lead milan update challenge wore modernity feel anxiety wardrobe piece respite future process grow french gala perfect intrinsically turmoil important engage dwayne memorable leatrice initiative premiere woman time familiar house award today duff frequently show greige hopeful shade tone tactility carpet signature psychology tuxedo chloé march human gabbana capture gather institute fabric vanity givenchy call territory lie,0.9934000000000001,0.07038948850305021,6.791090909090908,0.43865678346810416,0
CNN,The US shoplifting scourge is a lot of hype with little evidence,2023-12-07 08:20:00,Allison Morrow,"There’s been much handwringing over the scourge of shoplifting in America since 2020. To hear some retailers and politicians tell it, retail crime is out of control across the country.The trouble with that story is, it’s not accurate.To be clear, theft is happening, as it always has, in stores and on the streets. But the narrative that shoplifting has exploded since the start of the pandemic is unfounded.In reality, retail crime has not meaningfully gone up nationwide in the past few years, and it has even gone down in many places.A ﻿study released last month, drawing on police data, found that shoplifting reports were 16% higher in the first half of 2023 compared with 2019. But, critically, if you exclude New York City’s stats, the number of shoplifting incidents fell 7%, or about 2,550 fewer than in 2019, according to the Council on Criminal Justice, which conducted the study.Overall, the study found, shoplifting generally followed the same patterns as other theft, excluding car theft, over the past five years. Shoplifting remained below pre-pandemic levels through 2022.Even the National Retail Federation, the primary lobbying group for the retail industry, is acknowledging past reports have been inflated and retracting a key point in one of its widely cited reports about retail crime. (These industry reports are frequently cited by lawmakers, journalists and others about retail crime.)The report initially blamed organized retail crime for “nearly half” of all inventory losses in 2021. But the text has now been updated to remove that “nearly half” claim, because it turns out it wasn’t based on any data or research.The inaccurate claim was “an inference” made by an analyst linking results of an NRF survey from 2021 with testimony from a retail security expert, an NRF spokesperson said in a statement.The spokesperson added that the NRF stands behind the “widely understood fact that organized retail crime is a serious problem. … At the same time, we recognize the challenges the retail industry and law enforcement have with gathering and analyzing an accurate and agreed-upon set of data.”Major retailers like Target, Dick’s and Walgreens have cited rising theft as a drag on their bottom lines in recent earnings calls. (Walgreens, for its part, later walked the complaint back, with its finance chief telling investors in January that “maybe we cried too much” about shoplifting.)The loss of inventory, known as “shrink,” is certainly a drag on profitability. But external theft, according to the NRF’s latest survey of retailers, accounts for about 36% of overall shrink — about the same as the years leading up to the pandemic. That was only slightly higher than the shrink attributed to employee theft (29%) and good old fashioned losses due to mishandling or loss of goods (27%).Retail theft, which includes but isn’t limited to shoplifting, is notoriously difficult to measure. That’s the stats aren’t tracked at the federal level, said Alex Piquero, a professor of criminology and sociology at the University of Miami.“There’s shoplifting. And then there’s larceny.

CNN,Former Jacksonville Jaguars employee accused of stealing more than $22 million from NFL team to fund lavish lifestyle,2023-12-07 11:18:00,Ben Morse,"A former employee of the Jacksonville Jaguars has been accused of stealing more than $22 million from the NFL team to fund a lavish lifestyle, according to court documents filed in US District Court this week.The court filing says Amit Patel used the money to fund online gambling, pay for private travel and accommodation for himself and friends as well as sporting tickets, acquire a new Tesla car, Nissan pickup truck, purchase cryptocurrency and buy a property in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.He is also bought a Patek Philippe Nautilus watch – worth over $95,000 – paying the entire price with “proceeds of his fraud scheme.”According to the court documents, Patel is accused of wire fraud and illegal monetary transaction, stealing millions via the team’s virtual credit card (VCC) system over a four-year period.Patel is accused of stealing the money from an organization referred to as “Business A,” but the Jaguars confirmed to CNN Sport that they had employed Patel and were the victim of his alleged crimes.“We can confirm that in February 2023, the team terminated the employment of the individual named in the filing,” the team said in a statement sent to CNN.“Over the past several months we have cooperated fully with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida during their investigation and thank them for their efforts in this case.“As was made clear in the charges, this individual was a former manager of financial planning and analysis who took advantage of his trusted position to covertly and intentionally commit significant fraudulent financial activity at the team’s expense for personal benefit.“This individual had no access to confidential football strategy, personnel or other football information.“The team engaged experienced law and accounting firms to conduct a comprehensive independent review, which concluded that no other team employees were involved in or aware of his criminal activity.”CNN has reached out to Patel’s lawyers for comment.In the filing, Patel is said to have been the sole administrator for the Jaguars’ VCC system. A VCC system works similarly to a traditional credit card account, but without a physical card.Between September 2019 and February 2023 – when he was fired by the team – it’s alleged that Patel created an elaborate scheme to siphon money while avoiding detection.“For example, to hide his fraudulent VCC transactions, the defendant identified legitimate reoccurring VCC transactions, such as catering, airfare, and hotel charges, and then duplicated those transactions,” according to the the court documents.“He inflated the amounts of legitimate reoccurring VCC transactions; he entered completely fictious transactions that might sound plausible, but that never actually occurred; and he moved legitimate VCC chargers from upcoming months into the month of the integration file that was immediately due to the accounting department.”Patel waived his right to an indictment and the case will proceed based on the sworn information filed by federal prosecutors.",3061,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/sport/former-jacksonville-jaguars-employee-accused-stealing-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207112226-jacksonville-jaguars-stadium.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,victim cooperate employment steal refer tesla september enter fully investigation criminal case fbi inflate hide cryptocurrency florida sound catering airfare vedra aware fire jacksonville ponte amount beach make prosecutor nissan pickup charge planning proceed court acquire sole purchase analysis card illegal independent firm covertly monetary patek fictious lawyer access administrator defendant online commit bought work effort lavish plausible friend proceeds gamble system month patel attorney law review allege traditional property cnn base football waive trust confidential ticket employ personal reach travel conclude file terminate experienced elaborate worth virtual financial avoid identify buy legitimate vcc manager car occur accounting move entire accord due position pay information federal expense fund past transaction document price activity engage sworn money personnel nfl significant private individual account employee february conduct million siphon involve team statement completely accommodation truck upcoming office duplicate confirm similarly filing accuse former jaguar watch scheme credit create comprehensive immediately charger physical middle fraudulent philippe reoccurring strategy indictment intentionally business district advantage sport clear lifestyle wire organization fraud integration nautilus,-0.775,0.1960143743874551,12.042794117647055,0.35853625541125544,0
CNN,‘Waitress: The Musical’ serves up a zoomed in view of Sara Bareilles’ Broadway hit,2023-12-07 12:17:00,Brian Lowry,"Nothing produces a tingle up the spine quite like live theater, and “Waitress: The Musical” joins the list of filmed musicals that have preserved their stage qualities while giving viewers the best seat in the house. Sara Bareilles headlines this adaptation for which she wrote the lilting songs, in a show that manages to be alternately sweet and silly, touching and raunchy.Based on the 2007 movie starring Keri Russell, “Waitress” loaded up a full tray’s worth of Tony Award nominations in 2016, only to experience the unfortunate timing of getting shot down by running into the “Hamilton” buzzsaw. Appropriately, the latter’s production on Disney+ kicked off a pandemic wave of filmed musicals and plays coming to streaming services, which also included Apple’s “Come From Away,” both glittering examples of the form.Receiving a five-day theatrical window, the filmed version of the musical “Waitress” doesn’t climb to those heights, but it comes plenty close, and soars in moments. Bareilles, for example, earns (and deserves) a mid-show standing ovation after belting out “She Used to Be Mine,” a song that defines the musical’s emotional core.Said core comes from Bareilles’ Jenna, whose bond with her coworkers (Charity Angél Dawson, Caitlin Houlahan) at the local diner sustains her in the face of an unhappy home life with her abusive lout of a husband (Joe Tippett).Jenna is thus horrified to discover that she might be pregnant – the byproduct of a drunken night – though the unwelcome development does bring her into contact with an awkward doctor (Drew Gehling), with whom she begins an affair. Add that to her roster of questionable choices, which the two acknowledge head-on in a song titled “Bad Idea.”Jenna also possesses a knack for pie-making courtesy of her late mother, a skill that she hopes to use to procure her freedom, planning to enter a contest and use the prize money to run away. If that feels like a thin thread upon which to hang her hopes, it’s emblematic of the desperation that makes “Waitress” so poignant.The more theatrical aspects of the musical, such as Christopher Fitzgerald’s eccentric suitor, are clearly designed for an in-person setting, and risk feeling a little too big blown up for the screen.Nevertheless, in a month that brings two movie musicals in “The Color Purple” (also a movie turned into a musical) and “Wonka,” the show makes the transition with most of its charms – and Bareilles’ golden set of singing pipes – very much intact. And while “Waitress” is still probably a dish best served live, like “Hamilton” and “Come From Away,” seeing this event presentation feels like a good idea.“Waitress: The Musical” will play December 7-11 in US theaters.",2709,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/entertainment/waitress-the-musical-review-sara-bareilles/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231201105112-01-waitress-the-musical-review.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,diner enter questionable hang abusive blown seat russell silly appropriately christopher make version touch emblematic planning dawson core fitzgerald lout movie close service thread doctor awkward coworkers drunken keri charity stream husband moment adaptation unwelcome full nomination roster skill plenty deserves golden courtesy charm color month add alternately posse theater write bareilles pandemic gehling waitress manages tippett title song mother unfortunate buzzsaw pipe sweet tony contest risk join serve theatrical houlahan timing pregnant wave viewer procure worth eccentric byproduct film thin spine feel begin big glitter window ovation kick local sustains contact horrify production live include aspect probably event brings belting late experience run bond prize suitor transition stage defines give produce night stand money purple set musical home jenna sing load angél joe play design house knack star award shot caitlin tingle desperation latter dish show turn climb soar development life presentation apple emotional tray bring affair unhappy list discover hope earns acknowledge freedom wonka away quality hamilton choice height drew december headline intact preserve lilt,0.91075,0.22148394241417496,8.524675324675318,0.42863143631436323,0

Zephaniah came to prominence as a poet and author of the Black experience in Britain, breaking into the mainstream in the 1980s through his “dub poetry” – verse set to reggae music.His work often discussed his childhood experiences growing up in Handsworth in Birmingham, and the civil disturbances that spread through English cities in the mid-80s.He published 14 books of poetry, seven plays and seven albums of original music. He was named as one of the 50 greatest post war writers in The Times in 2008.His family posted on X: “Benjamin was a true pioneer and innovator; he gave the world so much. Through an amazing career including a hug body of poems, literature, music, television and radio.”DJ and BBC radio presenter Trevor Nelson called Zephaniah a “unique talent.”In a post to X, formerly Twitter, the BBC radio host wrote: “So sad to hear about the passing of Benjamin Zephaniah.

CNN,What to expect from Friday’s jobs report,2023-12-07 09:41:00,Alicia Wallace,"Employers are growing more cautious, pulling down some job postings and reining in hiring. Employees are sticking around more and not bouncing as readily for better opportunities.Welcome to the wait-and-see job market.Some of those holding patterns are being reflected in the federal jobs reports that have shown employment growth remaining historically strong but moderating to a mere shadow of the blockbuster gains seen in the early years of the pandemic economic recovery.In October, US employers added a net 150,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate inched up to 3.9%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.A similar story likely played out last month but with an added boost from striking autoworkers and actors returning to the workforce (and BLS’ tallies).Economists, by consensus, are expecting Friday’s jobs report, set for release at 8:30am ET, to show employment growth of 180,000 positions and for the jobless rate to hold steady at 3.9%, according to Refinitiv.“We’re expecting to see moderate growth,” Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn’s chief economist, told CNN in an interview. “And if our own data is any predictor, we’re actually thinking that it’s going to be a slightly underwhelming number.”If November’s job gains come in as expected, that rate of growth would be in line with what was seen during the decade before the pandemic. From 2010 to 2019, a period that included a record-setting 100 months of job growth, about 183,000 jobs were added per month on average.Economists had anticipated 180,000 jobs last month as well, but the October total fell short of estimates by 30,000 jobs.“Some of the weakness last month may have been illusory, just due to the strikes,” Julia Pollak, chief economist at online job site ZipRecruiter, told CNN.The United Auto Workers union, in an unprecedented and successful action, went on strike against the Big Three automakers of Ford, General Motors and Stellantis from mid-September through the end of October.October’s employment report included 33,200 jobs counted as lost in the motor vehicles and parts industry. BLS attributed those declines to strike activity: The agency’s strike report for that month counted 25,300 Ford, GM and Stellantis workers on strike.Additionally, the BLS strike report for November indicated that strikes ended for 16,000 SAG-AFTRA workers after the actors union and Hollywood studios reached an agreement in the early part of last month.Friday’s report could give more clues about whether the labor market is getting back into a more balanced and steady state, or whether it’s cooling more sharply than previously thought. On Wednesday, ADP’s private payrolls report showed a modest net gain of 103,000 jobs and slower wage gains, a smaller total than the 130,000 economists expected.While a lot of attention, deservedly, will land on Friday’s topline payroll and unemployment numbers as well as wage gain estimates, data revisions could also prove telling, Pollak told CNN.“For the last 10 months or so, jobs numbers have been revised downwards by an average of over 30,000,” she said. “If we see more downward revisions, then I think many people will conclude that the labor market is even weaker than it looked initially and is cooling quite rapidly.”Still, job gains remain historically strong and job cuts aren’t necessarily spiking but remain higher than they have been in the past decade.In November, US employers announced 45,510 job cuts, according to data released Thursday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That’s a 24% increase from October but a 41% drop from a year before, when tech companies were slashing jobs after bulking up during the pandemic.Year-to-date, companies have announced plans to make 686,860 job cuts, according to the Challenger report. Outside of 2020, that’s the highest January through November total since 2009, when 1.24 million cuts were announced.First-time claims for unemployment benefits, considered a proxy for layoffs, ticked up to 220,000 for the week ended December 2, according to Department of Labor data released Thursday.Also, while first-time claims for unemployment benefits remain low, Labor Department data also indicates that people are staying unemployed for longer.Continuing claims, filed by people who have received at least one week of unemployment benefits, have steadily marched higher in recent weeks and hit a yearly high of 1.925 million in mid-November. As of November 25, they dipped to 1.861 million.While that exceeds the historically low continuing claims seen in 2019, it remains well below longer-term averages.“There is no cumulative deterioration yet in the labor market that has caused previous Fed Chairs to pivot quickly from rate hikes to rate cuts to support the economy,” wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist with FwdBonds, in a note Thursday. “The weekly jobless data will keep the Fed on the sidelines watching carefully with the risks of doing too much or too little roughly balanced. Continuing unemployment claims looked more worrisome last week, but now it looks like a seasonal adjustment problem was responsible for the surge in the number of recipients.”He added: “Jobless claims are back in the soft landing camp for now, but for how long?”Although it’s settling in to a time of more modest growth, the US labor market is well poised for an eventual pickup.“It’s very much being held back by high interest rates,” said Pollak, noting the effects of inflation-battling monetary policy tightening. “Talk to any property investor and they say they’re not building because of high borrowing costs and low valuations … talk to manufacturers, and despite the various incentives and despite the huge amount of spending on factories, hiring is not really growing.”As such, many investments are not going to reach their potential until rates come down, she said. The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark lending rate to the highest level in 22 years in a monthslong battle to bring down inflation.“Employers are saying that they hope and expect business activity to pick up in the back half of 2024,” she added. “The unstated assumption there is that inflation will continue to come down, and the Fed will be able to start cutting rates.”",6222,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/november-jobs-report-preview/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206161431-people-with-briefcases-stock-120623.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,slow bulking karin initially employment raise lot increase november short back return layoff huge continue line manufacturer pull settle christopher remains amount revise jobless fwdbonds long half vehicle assumption lose economic reserve agency monetary blockbuster similar interview benchmark strong rupkey pattern exceeds christmas valuation company bureau illusory effect start receive sharply labor responsible weakness property write borrowing inched told cost cnn unemployed decade level release remain studio ticked reach adp conclude roughly wednesday file total economist story department strike consider automaker accord due pivot factory benefit worrisome fed poise cumulative potential worker past cautious slash small drop historically october estimate yearly net anticipate gm private set motor million indicates fell weekly action downward growth talk site market unprecedented clue period pick friday workforce attribute bring rein year weaker boost posting claim cool payroll held tech report december predictor january deterioration interest steady despite reflect rate quickly spike readily number inflation average auto moderate surge proxy make gray camp stay employer chief spending sideline policy ford tally stellantis expect eventual early steadily ziprecruiter hire plan successful online carefully recent wage industry united bounce shadow seasonal support previous chair month investment economy job land investor add part data deservedly kimbrough soft pandemic building monthslong pollak week state risk hike low union bls decline high big consensus note position federal include grow dipped julia underwhelming lending linkedin general activity stick attention revision previously give played challenger prove balance employee indicate announce hold time cut thursday hit hollywood slightly problem show agreement unstated tighten count watch autoworkers hope battle adjustment march necessarily incentive business modest topline actor unemployment,0.9654499999999999,0.04821600771456123,10.624125326370756,0.4323817966903073,0
CNN,Retail investors are sitting out the stock resurgence,2023-12-07 07:17:00,Krystal Hur,"This year’s stock rally is back on course, but not everyone is on board.The S&P 500 index in November notched its best monthly performance this year, snapping a three-month streak of steep losses as Wall Street became optimistic that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates. The revival in stocks, though off to a bumpy start in December, has been broad in reach, pulling up shares of everything from small caps to cyclical stocks.Among the chief catalysts for the rally are swooning US Treasury yields. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note fell to 4.12% on Wednesday, well below the 5% it topped in late October, according to Tradeweb.The glut of cash on the sidelines is “poised to fuel a significant rally in risk assets, offering investors an opportunity to potentially capitalize on improved sentiment and market dynamics,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in a note on Monday.But analysts say that retail traders aren’t jumping into the stock market and might not anytime soon. Cash is still king for many.The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement index for November, a measure of retail investor sentiment, revealed that the company’s clients were net sellers of stocks last month despite the market’s recovery. The index also recorded its lowest monthly reading since May.“A lot of retail investors are just happy to not participate right now,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.There is a record $5.84 trillion parked in money market funds as of November 29, according to Investment Company Institute data. About $2.25 trillion of that cash is in retail money market funds.While institutional investors are starting to pick at stocks poised to do well if the economy reaccelerates — explaining the rally’s widening breadth — retail traders are taking a more conservative approach, especially after seeing steep declines in their portfolios during last year’s sell-off, says Mulberry.Plus, yields are still at attractive levels compared to recent years, when low interest rates meant that cash offered little return for investors.Staying out of the stock market action and betting instead on fixed income is paying off for investors. The Bloomberg US Aggregate bond index, a widely-tracked benchmark for the performance of US investment-grade bonds, logged a 4.5% return in November. That’s the index’s best monthly performance since 1985.“Next year, [we’re] looking at a lot of uncertainty and volatility,” including the Fed’s rate trajectory and concerns about a possible recession, said Mulberry. “I think a lot of retail investors will just continue to sit on the sidelines.”The sell-off in the oil market accelerated Wednesday, with US crude prices sinking below $70 a barrel for the first time since July, reports my colleague Matt Egan.The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.Gas prices bottomed out at $3.10 a gallon in late December last year just before Christmas. The national average hasn’t been below $3 since May 2021.US crude tumbled to as low as $69.11 a barrel on Wednesday, the lowest intraday level since June 29. Oil closed at $69.38 a barrel, down 4.1% on the day. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 3.8% to $74.25 a barrel.Analysts said the sell-off is being driven by a confluence of factors, including concerns about soft demand in China, record-setting supply from the United States and disappointment over last week’s OPEC+ decision.“The market has fallen off quite rapidly,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. “It could really be interpreted as OPEC+ losing its ability to control prices.”Read more here.McDonald’s has a burger strategy to spark growth in the next few years. That strategy can be boiled down to one word: More.“In the US, in a number of markets, around the world, having a larger burger is an opportunity,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNN in an interview.“We’re working on that,” he added. “That is something that you should expect in the future.”It’s not just more burger in your burger. It’s more everything, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner.The burger chain plans to open thousands more restaurants. It wants to add 100 million members to its loyalty program, which nudges customers into spending more. And it’s investing in more marketing campaigns to get people craving its burgers and fries — and, increasingly, chicken sandwiches, too.McDonald’s has already been working on a plan to improve how its burger tastes. But it’s learned that in addition to softer buns and gooeyer cheese, people also want a more sizable burger.“We’ve listened to our customers. And we understand their desire for larger, high-quality burgers that fill you up,” said Jo Sempels, who oversees markets where McDonald’s has licensed its brand, during an investor event on Wednesday.Read more here.",4969,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/investing/premarket-stocks-trading-retail-cash/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190624171745-20190624-before-the-bell-logo-large-169.png?q=h_83,w_390,x_0,y_0/w_1280/h_80",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,danielle raise lot fall november brian share index record trillion back cash return continue glut pull anytime addition broad trader improve suggest confluence lose close firm large ceo reserve strategist benchmark compare kempczinski revival consult china sempels disappointment christmas sandwich offer company loyalty attractive open mcdonald streak start day gas cyclical write meant told course level cnn happy demand learn reach bet wednesday fix colleague global trajectory explain stock notch cap accelerate increasingly accord event oil king fed poise late sinking price listen small bond reaccelerates nudge october topped reveal net measure supply significant interpret gooeyer customer million uncertainty fell td action growth international market gallon institutional wall tumble national taste pick performance shah year p understand loss client member report driven december chain volatility sizable interest despite intraday rate associate snap june program bodes crude number oversees treasury average brent zacks bloomberg crave factor chief spending sentiment sideline possible bun reading july sell brand monthly desire expect concern instead opportunity plan recent united bottom work license campaign chris widen movement president month investment economy analyst investor add ameritrade data park soft swoon cheese boil week state participate risk barrel marketing restaurant street recovery yield seller low wave ability retail control decline manager seema portfolio note fuel consumer word breadth pay federal aggregate include fund rapidly lipow burger catalyst money world management income time asset invest especially conservative spark potentially principal offering dynamic matt rally thousand closer optimistic steep fry mulberry andy capitalize fill strategy jumping approach chicken institute softer read bumpy recession,0.9756,0.06037432078889112,9.487839831401473,0.42293320105820104,0
CNN,Taylor Swift says Kanye West and Kim Kardashian feud felt like a ‘career death’,2023-12-07 07:15:00,Jack Guy,"Taylor Swift has said that a 2016 feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian felt like “a career death,” adding it “took me down psychologically.”Swift was speaking to Time magazine after being named the publication’s 2023 “Person of the Year.”In the interview, published Wednesday, the singer recalled an incident in which West, also known as Ye, wrote a song featuring lyrics about Swift. Following a backlash, West claimed she had agreed to the lyrics in advance, which Swift disputed.West’s then-wife Kardashian went on to release a video of what she said was a conversation between Swift and West which proved the rapper’s claim.Swift told Time that she felt the incident was “a career death.”“Make no mistake — my career was taken away from me,” she said.“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” said Swift.“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls,” said the singer.“I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard,” she added.That was not the first time the singers had had a run-in. In 2009, West infamously hijacked the microphone from Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards.Since then, Swift’s career has gone from strength to strength, whereas West lost partnerships with fashion brands including Gap, Balenciaga and Adidas following antisemitic comments in 2022.Swift beat out Barbie and King Charles III to win Time’s “Person of the Year” award, with the magazine hailing her growing impact.“While her popularity has grown across the decades, this is the year that Swift, 33, achieved a kind of nuclear fusion: shooting art and commerce together to release an energy of historic force,” the magazine said.Time said Swift was selected because she found a way to give people around the world hope in some seriously dark times.“No one else on the planet today can move so many people so well,” Time said in its profile. “Achieving this feat is something we often chalk up to the alignments of planets and fates, but giving too much credit to the stars ignores her skill and her power.”",2307,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/entertainment/taylor-swift-kanye-west-feud-scli-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206152005-exp-taylor-swift-time-honor-rdr-120602pseg2-cnni-world-00002001.png?c=16x9&q=w_850,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,liar country barbie historic afraid person fully record rental win conversation strength charles infamously iii backlash force music partnership make kind kardashian manufacture foreign lose brand chalk popularity illegally antisemitic microphone feature power interview achieve skill leave hail job add rapper profile put comment alignment death gap kanye write phone told decade anymore fate release song incident edit trust ignores feud push place wednesday select psychologically dark claimed fashion move speak career include grow king energy video fusion singer grown commerce taylor give advance prove world balenciaga planet recall west time agree house art hijack award today star mistake feat life credit publication year hard publish shoot beat nuclear hope swift lyric away magazine follow mtv frame found call felt adidas,0.9374,0.39011703511053314,7.407157894736841,0.37833333333333335,0
CNN,Trump and his allies are threatening retribution against the press. Their menacing words should not be ignored,2023-12-07 07:11:00,Oliver Darcy,"The American press is facing, arguably, the gravest potential threat to its freedom in a generation.The four-time indicted, twice-impeached disgraced former president, Donald Trump, who admitted Tuesday that he will govern as a “dictator” on “day one” should he win office again, is overtly vowing to weaponize government and seek retribution against the news media, showing no regard for the First Amendment protections afforded to the Fourth Estate.The alarming rhetoric against the nation’s journalists, whom Trump has consistently and insidiously referred to as the “enemy of the people,” has also been echoed by his top allies, indicating the promises of revenge are not the rantings of a madman, but the actual intended course of action should the Republican presidential frontrunner manage to seize power again.In a particularly disturbing conversation this week, Trump’s former top political strategist, Steve Bannon, and former National Security Council adviser, Kash Patel, openly discussed plans to target the press. Bannon, who underscored that such promises are “not just rhetoric” and that they are “absolutely dead serious” about seeking revenge against journalists, asked Patel, who would likely serve in a second Trump administration, whether he could “deliver the goods.” Patel responded affirmatively, vowing that a re-empowered Trump would indeed “come after” the press.Bannon did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday and a spokesperson for Patel claimed he was only referring to targeting journalists “who break the law.” Regardless, Trump has himself said he will target news organizations, including most recently lashing out at Comcast over NBCU News Group’s coverage of him, saying the company should be “investigated.”“I say up front, openly, and proudly, that when I WIN the Presidency of the United States, they and others of the LameStream Media will be thoroughly scrutinized for their knowingly dishonest and corrupt coverage of people, things, and events,” Trump declared in September, adding that he believes the press “should pay a big price” for supposedly hurting the country.President Joe Biden’s campaign on Wednesday denounced the anti-press venom being injected into the public discourse by Trump and his allies.“Donald Trump and his cabal of snowflake henchmen are telling us what they will do if they get power. The plan apparently includes stomping on the bedrock principles of the First Amendment speech by locking up and punishing journalists for simply doing their jobs,” Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, told me in a statement. “The 2020 election and last year’s midterms made clear the American people will not accept these kinds of overt and existential attacks on our democracy.”But the reality is that Trump could be elected again. And his appalling rhetoric adds even more evidence to the already mountain of examples that signal he aims to behave like an authoritarian, should he manage to secure the White House in 2024, said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University who focuses on authoritarianism and democratic backsliding.“All autocrats consider the free press their enemy, and use legal harassment, imprisonment, and other methods to silence journalists,” Ben-Ghiat told me. “Trump, Patel, and others have already sued CNN and many other media outlets for defamation, and in doing so they are in line with authoritarians who use lawsuits to financially and psychologically exhaust journalists and media outlets.”Ben-Ghiat added that such public threats “are also attempts to get media outlets to self-censor.” She stressed “autocratic media environments depend not only on the dissemination of talking points friendly to the leader, but also on silence about anything the autocrat does not want the public to know.”Floyd Abrams, the famed First Amendment attorney, told me that he believes “a second Trump term would gravely threaten freedom of the press” and outlined a number of potential actions that could be taken to retaliate against the news media. Abrams said a second Trump administration could bring potential Espionage Act cases against outlets over the publication of internal deliberations regarding government actions; repeal Department of Justice guidelines barring subpoenas to hunt leakers; and take anti-press positions in the U.S. Supreme Court, among other things.Ted Boutrous, another First Amendment attorney, said the comments from Patel were “disgusting,” “fundamentally un-American,” and described actions “that seek to stick a dagger in the heart of the First Amendment.” But Boutrous stressed that the rhetoric on display for the public “should be taken seriously, given Mr. Trump’s and his staff’s egregious actions when Trump was in office.”Press freedom groups also spoke out on Wednesday against the anti-press fervor coursing through the MAGA-dominating wing of the Republican Party.“This kind of inflammatory rhetoric has no place in U.S. democracy,” Katherine Jacobsen, who heads U.S. affairs for the Committee to Protect Journalists, told me. “Thuggish threats to ‘come after’ members of the media in retaliation for their work covering elections is incredibly concerning, and creates a permission structure for violence against journalists.”",5286,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/media/trump-threatens-retribution-against-press/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220913135321-oliver-darcy.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,overtly gravest refer respond depend leaker alarm disturb top manage friendly win conversation line public intend threat cover request incredibly promise kind american retaliate nbcu described free overt strategist katherine power lash weaponize thuggish financially gravely subpoena mountain aim appal defamation company govern reality regard front bedrock hunt day adviser lock told particularly course democratic cabal cnn outline ammar hurt scrutinize arguably autocrat wednesday medium psychologically kash department biden silence head consider deliver fundamentally evidence structure supposedly event potential nation price political apparently history moussa jacobsen exhaust violence guideline coverage madman break imprisonment disgrace spoke indict inject dictator harassment university authoritarian action republican talk fervor ruth bar retribution simply permission espionage proudly national former press absolutely publication bring affair year declare snowflake dead abrams rhetoric member act deliberation punish spokesperson clear amendment leader lamestream dissemination september speech vow justice outlet case number threaten attack consistently stomp make ally court knowingly presidency internal disgust indeed administration wing professor henchman repeal concern supreme dagger plan united seize secure floyd admit believe bannon journalist work recently discuss revenge principle venom boutrous legal campaign president tuesday actual job add patel attorney environment comment stress group presidential signal term week fourth autocratic state trump heart serve display place seek elect protection democracy enemy dishonest staff big claimed method retaliation focus york position pay protect include discourse afford denounce council stick point frontrunner government give existential authoritarianism affirmatively insidiously indicate behave corrupt echoed inflammatory joe statement comcast house office news target ranting show egregious donald steve accept underscored election midterm creates freedom white attempt security openly famed organization lawsuit committee,-0.93055,0.11350737797956868,12.015702127659573,0.4186193568336425,0
CNN,The stunning 30-hour train ride that sells out in seconds,2023-12-07 06:50:00,Zara Khan,"Turkey is the final stop for one of the most famous train rides in the world, the Orient Express. But another journey – the Dogu Express, or Eastern Express in English – is making the country one of the world’s leading rail destinations.Historically a commuter train from Ankara to Kars, the train has gone viral among Turkish influencers in recent years for its stunning scenery through the east, full of off-the-beaten-path treasures.Berry Romo, a travel influencer who has been living in Turkey for over a decade, notes that “the train was already quite popular among locals and Turkish travelers, but barely known among foreign tourists.”In response to the growing demand, the commuter service was, in 2019, turned into a tourist route. The 30-plus hours sleeper train runs from bustling capital Ankara to the sometimes snowy wonderland of Kars – a distance of 1,310 kilometers (814 miles) – with stops along the way where city excursions are organized.However, tickets are notoriously hard to come by. Passengers say they often sell out within minutes.“The trick is to check the website as soon as it’s midnight and buy when the website refreshes,” Romo said.Turkish travel agencies usually buy large quantities of tickets to resell for tours they organize, ensuring their clients a place on the train, which is why, according to locals, tickets are gone so soon. Individual tickets can only be bought a month in advance, making them a coveted prize for the few who get them.At first glance, Ankara might seem less glamorous than better-known Istanbul, but the political center of the country is a worthy destination in its own right.Top sites include the Ataturk mausoleum, the final resting place of modern Turkey’s founding father, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.The complex is divided into four parts. Highlights include Peace Park, with a Turkish flag composed of pebble stones surrounded by a flower bed, and the Ceremonial Plaza which leads up to the Hall of Honor that houses the tomb of Ataturk.Though Ankara embarked on a rapid pace of development after becoming the country’s new capital overnight in 1923, there is still some historical charm to be found among its old neighborhoods.Ulus is the old quarter of the city where there are Roman ruins, preserved passageways and even an old castle, perched on a hill, offering sweeping panoramic vistas of the surrounding scenery.Within Ulus lies Sanat Sokağı, or Arts Street, a stretch of restored Ottoman houses that have been converted into cafes leads to courtyards filled with stalls selling handicrafts and Ottoman-era souvenirs.For a more contemporary experience, head to CemModern, a new art gallery hosting global exhibitions in a restored railway depot. The cultural events here are varied, ranging from movie screenings to group yoga sessions and design markets.The Dogu Express departs around early evening and, as it pulls away from the art deco Ankara railway station, the view out the window quickly morphs from sprawling metropolis to sweeping vistas.Sleeper cabins are fitted with two single bunk beds that can be converted back down to seats during the day, a mini-fridge and a sink. Travelers often decorate their compartments with string lights, scarves and candles.This makes for “a great way to enjoy a beautiful landscape in a cozy way,” according to Romo.Early the next morning, the train arrives in Ilic, a small village whose main draw is its proximity to Karanalik, or Dark Canyon. The Canyon is home to the breathtaking Stone Road, which clings to the canyonside when it’s not plunging into one of its 38 tunnels or negotiating terrifying turns.Despite a reputation for danger, the road regularly lures tourists with its stunning scenery. It offers dramatic cliffs and steep gorges, all with the Euphrates flowing below.The train then descends further east, into the heartland of Anatolia. Netta Kalpan, a native Minnesotan who lived in the Black Sea coastal area of Trabzon and was used to harsh snowy winters, says she “didn’t realize how big, flat, and cold Turkey could be” before taking the train.Yet, she describes the landscape as “stunning, mostly in its vastness.”“I kept trying to take videos out the windows” but felt “like I wasn’t able to capture how it really felt to see it,” she says.As evening falls, the train pulls into Erzurum. Romo says visiting the city was “without a doubt, one of the best experiences” she’s had in Turkey for the city’s rich “history, culture, and extraordinary gastronomy.”Erzurum is home to many different types of local cuisine, most famously, the Cag Kebab. Lamb is marinated for about 12 hours in onions, salt and pepper, then placed on a skewer and cooked over a wood fire before being wrapped in warm flatbread or eaten straight off the skewer.After Erzurum, there are only a few hours left on the Dogu Express before it arrives at its final destination, Kars.Famous for its winter wonderland landscape, its name is taken from the Turkish word for snow. The city is known for its unique architecture stemming from the days it was part of the Russian Empire.Ummu Altunas, a lawyer from Istanbul, likens visiting the east of Turkey to visiting an entirely “different country” from the more European west. This is partly, she says, because “east is home to many different cultures,” such as Kurds, Armenians and Assyrians.The medieval city of Ani, the former capital of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia, is one such example. Just a short drive from Kars, majestic ruins dating back 1,600 years are open to tourists. Vast walls and well-preserved churches, all overlooking a deep ravine, offer visitors a journey back through time.Although Turkey’s eastern regions draw fewer tourists, locals are often eager to welcome visitors with traditional Turkish hospitality.Kaplan says that one reason she loved living in the east of Turkey is because it was “gratifying to be around people who love where they’re from.”She says she doesn’t mean to put down Istanbul, adding: “It’s easy to be proud of a place everyone agrees is one of the most magnificent cities in the world.”But to embrace a place less frequented by travelers?“That feels special.”",6167,https://www.cnn.com/travel/turkey-dogu-eastern-express-train/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205150242-01-eastern-express.jpg?c=original&q=h_618,c_fill",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country european visitor turkish reason erzurum ruin fall response quarter short hill back eager covet pull seat fire kemal russian doubt sink stop describes skewer drive enjoy tourist istanbul highlight gorge tunnel service large culture traveler breathtaking influencer agency ilic euphrates anatolia type draw hall warm turkey canyon regularly historical entirely full ride beautiful view screening stem bought ottoman unique trick lamb offer open tomb put day express traditional cuisine decade extraordinary demand frequent landscape kars kurd reputation travel church journey scenery orient buy global route cultural deco mustafa dark metropolis cliff train head station realize destination coastal local courtyard kebab accord likens live event wonderland capital eastern video stall tour political small cozy experience history region resell eat prize contemporary cold minnesotan convert living advance rail arrives modern barely cooked sanat snow pepper quantity sprawl home pace west cafe complex proud flower site ulus design perch wall stone peace onion passageway center turn famously embrace website light former flow rich excursion ceremonial string year hard overlook stun client bed away compartment glamorous single flatbread karanalik found famous felt preserve passenger rest sweep sokağı compose salt wood visit quickly altunas village proximity ankara dogu lure agrees snowy medieval dramatic harsh morning departs partly range negotiate make pebble special commuter yoga city foreign sell movie armenia restore flat flag mausoleum early organize distance cling popular ataturk gratify session lawyer plunge road recent hour descends canyonside trabzon winter worthy straight magnificent charm railway month date ravine sleeper add different scarf part architecture park viral honor group influencers easy black ancient surround rapid love depot marinate lead refreshes check ticket armenian panoramic place cemmodern street host bustling cabin wrap native feel morphs big window note word cag vast include grow fit kilometer gallery danger bunk netta embark welcome decorate glance exhibition run romo kingdom left father world roman castle ensure individual english vista midnight varied house notoriously art final deep development offering heartland east overnight steep majestic divide fill mile handicraft terrify stretch capture ani plaza kalpan great lie area,0.99655,0.14593805740230256,9.838728522336769,0.479156941768549,0

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy repeatedly attacked former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, at times accusing her of corruption. Meanwhile, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie slammed Ramaswamy for changing positions and defended Haley against his attacks. There are now less than six weeks until the pivotal Iowa caucuses, a tradition that has historically served as a test of campaigns’ organizational strength before the party determines its nominee.Three people are dead and one person is in stable condition after a shooting at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, police said on Wednesday. The suspect, identified as a 67-year-old career college professor, is also dead. His connection to UNLV is unknown at this time. Police said the suspect fired shots outside of a hall where students were gathering and playing games. “What happened today is a heinous, unforgivable crime … If it hadn’t been for the heroic actions of one of those police officers who responded, there could have been countless additional lives taken,” Las Vegas Metro Sheriff Kevin McMahill said. The shooting marks the 80th school shooting in the US this year.The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza will open today for dozens of foreign nationals and dual citizens to exit the war-torn strip, according to Egyptian authorities. More than 60 US citizens are among the dozens of foreign nationals set to leave, alongside nationals of Romania, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Rafah is the only border crossing in Gaza not controlled by Israel and the last remaining outlet for supplies. It has been a vital lifeline for aid to enter the enclave and for people to escape the fighting since Israel’s war with Hamas began in October.A partisan clash between Senate Republicans and Democrats over border policy continues to threaten the effort to send desperately needed aid to Israel and Ukraine. Republicans blocked foreign aid from advancing Wednesday evening in protest over the package’s lack of changes to US border and immigration policy. The procedural vote on the Senate floor was 49 to 51, falling short of the 60-vote threshold needed to proceed. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday represented a “sad night” after the failed vote, but emphasized that Democrats “remain committed to working very hard to find a solution to this impasse.”The Biden administration is delaying a long-awaited ban on menthol cigarettes. The move is angering health advocates who believe the president postponed the ban to avoid alienating Black voters, who disproportionately smoke menthol-flavored tobacco products. The administration did not give its reasons for the delay. A final menthol rule is not expected until March. This comes as the tobacco industry has been working to align itself with African-American advocacy groups in a bid to resist further regulation. Among its arguments against a ban is that it would criminalize the flavor of cigarettes preferred by Black smokers, leading to an underground market of the goods.McDonald’s unveils CosMc’s, its rival to StarbucksThe fast-food chain finally shared more details about its oddly secretive restaurant concept called CosMc’s.‘Squid Game: The Challenge’ crowns winnerThe winner of the Netflix reality show took home the top prize of $4.56 million during Wednesday’s season finale.

CNN,Here’s why it would be even harder now to kill Obamacare,2023-12-07 06:06:00,Tami Luhby,"A record number of people signing up for Obamacare policies. Nine more states expanding Medicaid coverage to more than 2 million adults. Much higher favorability ratings among the public. Another victory for the landmark health reform law in the nation’s highest court.These are among the main reasons why it would be even tougher than it was in 2017 for Republicans to try to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, even if they secure control of the White House and Congress next year.The 13-year-old law is even more embedded in the nation’s health care system than it was when former President Donald Trump took office, vowing to kill Obamacare. But he and the Republican lawmakers who controlled Congress ultimately failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act after months of unsuccessful attempts to come up with an alternative.Obamacare’s future is once again in the spotlight after Trump, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, unexpectedly posted on his Truth Social site last month that Republicans should “never give up” trying to terminate the law and that he would replace it with “MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also vying for the Republican nomination, followed suit, saying that he would “replace and supersede” the Affordable Care Act with “a better plan” since “Obamacare has not worked.” The law took plenty of heat during Wednesday’s fourth GOP presidential debate.But most of the nation, particularly Republican voters and many GOP lawmakers, have moved on from trying to repeal and replace the law.And while Obamacare had a rocky start, with enrollment coming lower than expected in the federal and state exchanges, insurers dropping out of the marketplaces and many Republican-led states refusing to expand Medicaid, it has since stabilized.More than 40 million Americans now have health care coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, up from just under 27 million in 2017, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Obamacare’s popularity increased after congressional Democrats enhanced the federal premium subsidies in 2021.Many more people benefit from the law’s provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from being turned away or charged higher premiums by insurers, allow children to remain on their parents’ plans until age 26 and provide an array of preventive services at no cost.“We’re as close as we’ve been to meeting the aspirational goals of 2010 for the ACA,” said Rodney Whitlock, vice president at McDermott+Consulting and a former health policy adviser on the Senate Finance Committee under Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. “It was still in its infancy in 2017. Now it has matured enough that it is stable and functioning.”Here is why the Affordable Care Act would be more difficult to dismantle now.Record interest in Obamacare coverage: More people are insured through the Affordable Care Act exchanges than ever before. Some 15.7 million people were enrolled in Obamacare plans in February, up 13% from a year earlier, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the exchanges. Plus, 1.5 million more people enrolled between March and September, compared with the same period in 2022.Americans are continuing to flock to the exchanges for 2024 coverage too. Nearly 7.3 million people have selected plans in the first five weeks of this year’s open enrollment period, which began November 1. That’s an increase of nearly 34% from roughly the same period a year earlier.Spurring much of this interest are the hefty federal premium subsides that are available through 2025. President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats beefed up the assistance as part of the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act and renewed the enhancement as part of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act. The expanded subsidies enable 4 out of 5 people to find a plan for less than $10 a month. Some 91% of enrollees were receiving subsidies as of February.In 2017, only 10.3 million people were enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans.Also, those signing up for coverage now have far more choice of insurers and policies than they did in 2017. Some 210 health insurance issuers are participating on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, in 2024. The average enrollee has just under seven issuers to pick from.But there were only 167 issuers participating in 2017, and the average consumer had only three to choose from. Several large insurers, including Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare, had announced they were scaling back participation in 2016.More states implement Medicaid expansion: There are now 40 states that have adopted the Obamacare provision expanding Medicaid coverage to more low-income adults. That’s nine more than in 2017.In most of the states, voters forced resistant Republican-led legislatures to broaden Medicaid by approving ballot initiatives. Maine began the trend in 2017, though it wasn’t implemented until a Democratic governor took office in 2019. Idaho, Nebraska, Utah, Missouri and Oklahoma followed, with South Dakota becoming the latest to adopt Medicaid expansion at the ballot box in 2022.Virginia expanded Medicaid in 2018, while North Carolina did so on December 1. In each of these two states, Democratic and Republican officials worked together to adopt the provision after years of resistance by the GOP.Nationwide, nearly 18.8 million newly eligible Americans were enrolled in Medicaid as of September 2022, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2017, that figure was 12.2 million.Higher favorability ratings: Nearly 60% of adults have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act, close to the highest share since the law was passed in 2010, according to the KFF Health Tracking Poll.That’s quite a difference from December 2016, when only 43% had a favorable opinion of Obamacare.Another change: The law’s future is more important to Democratic voters than Republican ones, according to a different KFF poll. Overall, 49% of voters said the issue is “very important,” but breaking it down by party, 70% of Democratic voters felt that way, while only 32% of Republican voters did. Obamacare had been a key health care issue for GOP voters in the past.Supreme Court leaves law intact: After Congress failed to repeal Obamacare, a coalition of GOP-led states and the Trump administration tried to take it down through the US court system.The states argued the act’s individual mandate was rendered unconstitutional when Congress in 2017 reduced the penalty for not having coverage to $0. They also contended that because the mandate was intertwined with a multitude of other provisions, the entire law should fall.But the Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit in 2021, saying the challengers did not have the legal right to bring the case.The case marked the third time the law survived a significant challenge in the Supreme Court.",6919,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/obamacare-affordable-care-act-repeal/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206131540-obamacare-leading-insurance-agency-miami-2021.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,humana reason vie spotlight available increase condition insurance dakota change november penalty record opinion share back continue public supersede track american charge unitedhealthcare close popularity service large aca reduce leaf compare argue nomination reduction view marketplace plenty mandate system open difficult enrollment start receive law adviser particularly insurer democratic key remain issuer congressional senate child gov poll resistance renew expand roughly wednesday enrol premium trend ballot department biden begin move accord benefit enhance embed subsidy nation late heat drop signing ron favorable coverage meeting significant break rocky beefed iowa million figure box north republican congress carolina site unexpectedly insured dismantle center turn period enhancement former pick favorability bring utah year aspirational resistant landmark intertwine nebraska provision post away follow medicare act preventive december felt affordable difference official hefty contend vice interest september social vow case number florida inflation kill missouri oversees average party force voter enrollee participation fail court victory policy exchange expansion administration expect repeal kff enable supreme oklahoma plan adult aetna refuse rating secure idaho work array implement legal president choose rodney lawmaker month preexist different gop part governor unconstitutional adopt eligible presidential find goal week scale fourth state participate approve trump finance terminate low select control challenge high replace mature obamacare parent subsides entire consumer stable earlier future federal protect include marked whitlock important run survive suit give initiative challenger individual february medicaid health broaden announce coalition render grassley time joe issue house office rescue tougher multitude infancy unsuccessful desantis newly truth provide reform donald flock legislature ultimately chuck age white march south human attempt choice intact pass dismiss lawsuit assistance democrat committee,0.98315,0.13007660066483595,11.133816425120774,0.428545840464445,0
CNN,"From the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church, an upcoming Supreme Court ruling may mean some victims won’t see their day in court",2023-12-07 06:00:00,Samantha Delouya,"On Monday, the US Supreme Court grappled with one of the highest-profile bankruptcy cases the court has taken on in decades.The case hinges on the legality of OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma’s multibillion-dollar bankruptcy plan ­— which would have the Sackler family, who once owned the pharmaceutical giant, personally pay up to $6 billion to victims of the opioid crisis, including state governments, local governments, Native American tribes and individuals, in exchange for the family’s legal immunity from future civil lawsuits. The deal would also mean the family would not have to admit any guilt or wrongdoing related to allegations that the Sacklers were complicit in aggressively marketing OxyContin and downplaying its highly addictive properties.But the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision in this case may affect much more than the Sackler family’s fortune. Third-party releases, the provision that would allow the Sacklers to be shielded from additional civil lawsuits, have become an increasingly popular device by organizations accused of mass harm, recently including the Boy Scouts of America and scores of Catholic dioceses in the United States.According to Nicole Langston, a bankruptcy scholar and assistant professor of law at Vanderbilt University Law School, provisions shielding third parties from legal liability have become a “matter of course” in many corporate bankruptcy proceedings. Proponents of third-party releases say they’re the quickest and fairest way for victims to receive compensation for harm done by a company or other organization. Those who oppose the provision say it’s a way for potentially liable parties to skirt legal scrutiny, possibly weakening consumer protections.The Sackler family has said it would not agree to the multibillion-dollar settlement without being shielded from current and future liability due to the thousands of additional civil cases it would inevitably have to settle or fight in court. The US Trustee, which serves as a watchdog over bankruptcy cases, has argued that the deal is an “abuse” of the bankruptcy system.Those who agree with the US Trustee argue that third-party liability releases prevent individuals harmed by a company from getting their day in court.“The bankruptcy system is set up to try to find an orderly way for a company to pay off its creditors, including people who might have lawsuits against that company,” said Adam Zimmerman, a professor of law at the USC Gould School of Law. “These third-party releases involve situations where it’s not just the company going through the bankruptcy that is getting that kind of immunity on the other side, it’s someone else who has contributed funds… who is now trying to get the benefits of the bankruptcy.”A recent draft paper, co-authored by Zimmerman, argues that “approving the Sackler releases, or doing so without clear guardrails to prevent abuses to the rule,” would embolden even more solvent companies to use bankruptcy to resolve mass injury claims. “It would result in less information production… less due process, and fewer opportunities for plaintiffs to make their stories heard,” according to the paper.Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy agreement was reached after years of lawsuits against the company and its owners over their alleged role in the skyrocketing number of opioid addictions since OxyContin entered the US market.The Supreme Court hearing comes at a time of devastating losses due to drug overdoses in the United States. From 1999 to 2021, nearly 645,000 people died from an opioid overdose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.While Purdue’s bankruptcy deal was approved by more than 95% of victims, the US Trustee has argued that bankruptcy court cannot bind the 5% who voted “no” into a deal that does not allow them to pursue legal action against the Sacklers.“You can imagine that there are people with a different view of the case. Maybe they’ve lost a family member and they don’t see money as any real form of justice for them,” Langston said. “For them, it’s not a fair deal.”Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family have maintained that the bankruptcy agreement would be the best deal for victims. During oral arguments, the justices heard from an attorney representing some of the victims of the epidemic who stressed that if the court rejects the agreement, an onslaught of civil suits against the Sacklers from states and individual victims would result in very little compensation for any party.“Whatever is available from the Sacklers — whether that’s $3 billion, $5 billion, $6 billion, $10 billion — there are about $40 trillion in estimated claims. As soon as one plaintiff is successful, that wipes out the recovery for every other victim,” the attorney, Pratik Shah, said in response to a question from Justice Brett Kavanaugh.But Langston said a ruling in favor of Purdue could “open up this floodgate of nonconsensual third-party releases.”“You could imagine that consumers of everyday products or medicine might be concerned about a potential lack of care or recklessness or negligence of some of these third parties. If the bankruptcy court allows these type of deals, they can just write away their liability,” Langston said. “As consumers, we should be wary of that.”Legal experts will likely pay close attention to the Supreme Court’s decision in the Purdue Pharma case, said Anthony Casey, a law professor at the University of Chicago Law School and director of the school’s Center on Law and Finance.“My take is that it’s the biggest bankruptcy case to go to the Supreme Court in 30 or 40 years. It’s huge,” he said.But the Purdue case is not the only high-profile mass-harm case making its way through the US court system, and several other organizations have turned to bankruptcy courts to shield individual executives and other third parties from added legal trouble.One such organization is the Boy Scouts of America. The youth program filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020 amid claims by thousands of men who say they were abused as children by Boy Scout troop leaders, and the plan went into effect in April. The agreed-upon $2.4 billion settlement also includes provisions that protect multiple parties from additional civil lawsuits. Those third-party releases, and potentially the entire settlement, would be jeopardized through a potential court appeal if the Purdue case were to be struck down by the Supreme Court, Casey said.While such agreements are controversial, Casey said he doesn’t see how else a deal would work in this instance.“There’s just no way to get a deal. No insurer is going to put money into the settlement unless they know it’s resolving the lawsuits,” Casey said. Without third-party releases, the crush of litigation and insurance claims would mean “assets get liquidated, and the organization ceases to exist,” he added.In recent years, the Catholic Church and other religious organizations have also faced a torrent of lawsuits related to allegations of sexual abuse. Multiple dioceses in the United States have filed for bankruptcy with provisions for third-party liability releases.In a Supreme Court filing, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops expressed support for Purdue’s bankruptcy structure, arguing that “in exchange for a release from liability on claims of alleged abuse, Catholic parishes, schools, and other diocesan entities contribute significant sums to a common fund, maximizing the recovery for abuse claimants and relieving them of the struggle to recover in piecemeal litigation.”Casey said companies like DuPont and 3M, which are beginning to face a crush of lawsuits for PFAS — also known as “forever chemicals,” that have allegedly contaminated drinking water, food and soil across the country — are watching for the Supreme Court’s decision in the Purdue case.“That’s just getting started. That’s not in bankruptcy now, but whether they would or wouldn’t end up in bankruptcy, they have to be watching this,” Casey said.CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to reporting.",8037,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/purdue-pharma-supreme-court-bankruptcy/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-12-03t095812z-1093845698-rc2kp4agyfcd-rtrmadp-3-usa-court-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy.JPG?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country allegation contaminate heard available enter claimant response chicago insurance argues trillion huge argument watchdog maximize resolve settle solvent owner mass kind side american expert liquidate troop drinking lose scout langston close pursue contribute type appeal diocese trustee compensation argue vanderbilt rule chemical personally abuse view inevitably disease proceeding religious company system open effect represent draft struggle maintain matter assistant receive start law put deal allege day soil express amid write insurer course release multiple immunity america executive child harm embolden april school reach file church forever story negligence guilt begin devastate local increasingly accord structure due proponent sackler information benefit paper jeopardized wary entity sum common usc prevent potential wrongdoing role medicine estimate recklessness purdue current corporate significant set boy adam wipe university possibly action form litigation agree relieve upcoming concerned diocesan skirt center imagine turn overdoses casey sexual filing accuse weaken fight exist skyrocket civil dupont shah year devan quick nicole lack claim loss provision controversial away related member result water clear scholar leader sacklers scrutiny victim pratik torrent liable zimmerman struck piecemeal nonconsensual recover bankruptcy addiction case justice program liability number ruling bind crush complicit party fair make addictive court downplay cole exchange professor favor crisis gould supreme popular opportunity parish plan successful recent united family opioid admit situation work bishop recently allegedly support giant legal brett pfas question add overdose attorney different orderly stress serf find grapple highly conference reporting state approve floodgate marketing recovery decision control legality native food oxycontin injury big fortune aggressively monday entire consumer guardrail vote future affect process pay protect include catholic fairest director fund real suit attention government money pharmaceutical youth device individual shield involve score time asset additional cease tribe creditor potentially hinge agreement onslaught watch thousand oppose plaintiff settlement oral hearing epidemic anthony billion product pharma chapter reject everyday lawsuit organization,-0.21815,0.1119820828667413,10.780706521739127,0.42487515605493137,0

CNN,Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia want to do more business together. Here’s why,2023-12-08 01:13:00,Michelle Toh,"For the first time, Hong Kong’s leader has welcomed Saudi Arabian elites to the city for an investment conference, in an example of how it is embracing new potential business partners as it confronts a slumping economy and geopolitical uncertainty.In opening remarks on Thursday, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee called the gathering “yet another significant step forward, in the deepening [of] ties between Hong Kong and the Middle East, particularly the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”The two-day event was organized by the Hong Kong government, its stock exchange and the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute — a nonprofit founded by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. The institute hosts an annual event in Riyadh dubbed “Davos in the Desert.”PIF Governor and FII Institute Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan said onstage Thursday that the institute was looking to expand in Asia. It opened a Hong Kong office in 2020, and “hopefully, very soon we will open up in China and India,” he added.Al-Rumayyan said Hong Kong was selected as a partner for the latest FII event in part because of the city’s role as a major financial hub and proximity to mainland China.Hong Kong has aggressively courted Saudi Arabia for more business this year as it works to hedge against US-China tensions, which have led to the greater risk of Western companies reducing their operations in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, said Willy Lam, senior China fellow of the Jamestown Foundation, a US think tank.He called the summit “a shot in the arm” for Hong Kong’s economy, which he says has suffered from an exodus of foreign talent, decline in property prices and drop in the number of foreign companies using the city as a regional base in recent years.“Saudi Arabia could be a big prize for Hong Kong,” given the size of its economy and trusted allyship with China, according to Lam. Last year, the two countries signed a strategic partnership agreement.George Chan, a Shanghai-based global IPO leader for EY, also said the summit was a way for Hong Kong to advance its goal of “diversifying” its economic partnerships amid complex global challenges.“Additionally, as geopolitics prompts Middle Eastern countries to diversify investments, Hong Kong is an ideal destination given its strength in bridging mainland China, Asia, and global capital flows,” he told CNN.Officials in Hong Kong have good reason to be casting a wider net. In the face of a global slowdown, the city is suffering a drought of initial public offerings (IPOs).Its IPO market is currently in the midst of its worst year since 2003, according to data provider Dealogic, with just under $4.6 billion in proceeds raised as of early December.The government is working to change that. In February, Lee traveled to Riyadh, where he met with the CEO of state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, the world’s third most valuable company, and floated the idea of a listing in Hong Kong, according to a government statement.Aramco went public in Riyadh in 2019, in what was then the biggest IPO of all time. Chan said “a blockbuster Aramco offering could spark a Hong Kong IPO reawakening, positioning the city as the gateway of choice bridging Middle East titans and Asian ambitions longer-term.”Al-Rumayyan, who also serves as chairman of Aramco, did not mention the prospect of a secondary listing on Thursday.Asked about the matter during an interview with CNN’s Marc Stewart on Thursday, Laura Cha, chair of the Hong Kong stock exchange, said she could not comment on individual companies, though “we have a healthy pipeline.”Hong Kong’s bourse has made it easier for such a listing to happen. In September, it added the Saudi stock exchange to its list of recognized exchanges, allowing Saudi-listed companies to apply for a secondary listing in the city.Last week, Hong Kong also introduced what it billed as Asia’s first exchange-traded fund (ETF) to track Saudi Arabian equities, allowing investors to easily buy shares in the Gulf country’s biggest listed companies.",4051,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/business/hong-kong-saudi-arabia-investment-summit-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210908115524-20210908-mme-logo-v2-large-169.png?q=h_102,w_438,x_0,y_0/w_1280/h_80",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country cha raise reason change share arabia public strategic tension saudi partnership track major prospect nonprofit annual economic ceo reduce blockbuster ideal interview senior happen western marc china aramco hong arabian proceeds company open drought matter mention ey amid property particularly chairman told cnn trust executive davos yasir expand travel bill cast financial buy global mainland stock partner destination laura accord equity stewart john event oil exodus potential elite geopolitical late ipo eastern capital price role hub drop prize additionally advance net significant suffer operation slump geopolitics sign complex idea midst market asia embrace flow remark year hedge healthy step willy reawaken regional bridging kong found introduce leader middle september proximity gateway titan number strength sovereign foundation lee provider make allyship chief court forward city exchange foreign talent early organize opening onstage tie recent bourse gathering valuable deepen riyadh jamestown work dubbed lam etf chan fellow wealth chair investment economy summit add investor part pif data comment governor ambition serf easy easily base goal lead week conference risk host select confronts decline big aggressively position future secondary fund welcome india government give recognize kingdom initiative world dealogic individual february chinese time thursday listing initial office diversify asian shot float spark apply offering east list arm wider gulf slowdown business billion institute prompt great choice call size currently,0.98405,0.0,9.985359477124181,0.31509090909090914,0
CNN,Luka Dončić makes NBA history in Dallas Mavericks’ 50-point blowout victory,2023-12-07 05:34:00,Ben Morse,"Something was different about Luka Dončić in the Dallas Mavericks’ 147-97 victory over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.It wasn’t new shoes or a new haircut. No, it was a headband – and with the new accessory, came great power.In the Dallas Mavericks’ 50-point blowout of the Utah Jazz, Dončić had a record-breaking game on multiple fronts, despite only playing three quarters.In the first half of action alone, the Slovenian had 29 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, achieving the highest-scoring, first-half triple-double in NBA history. He also became the first player in league history to rack up a 25-point triple-double before halftime.With just over a minute remaining in the first half, Dončić was a rebound and assist away from creating history. He grabbed his rebound with 1:11 left before getting his 10th assist 12 seconds later with a pass to Dereck Lively II.Mavs fans at American Airlines Center followed along with Dončić’s journey towards history on the big screen above the court and loud cheers were let out when he finally reached the mark.After the game, Dončić admitted that he knew how close he was to a first-half triple-double and was searching for it.“Yeah, of course. I was going for that. I got to admit,” he said.It was the 60th triple-double of Dončić’s young career, moving him past NBA icon Larry Bird into sole possession of ninth on the all-time triple-double list.“It’s amazing,” he said. “I don’t know what to say, honestly. But we all know who Larry Bird was, so it’s pretty special.”The 24-year-old finished Wednesday’s game with 40 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds as Dallas routed the Jazz.It was Dončić’s seventh career game with 40+ points, 10+ rebounds and 10+ assists, tying Wilt Chamberlain for fourth most in NBA history.“Everybody said (the triple-double) was the headband,” Dončić – who explained he wore the headband to keep his longer hair out of his eyes – said. “I say it’s me.”Dallas head coach Jason Kidd was full of praise for his star guard afterwards.“I think he’s had a lot of fun this season,” Kidd said of Dončić. “He’s competing, he’s having fun and the energy was extremely high. And I think the headband works.”The emphatic victory came at a vital time for the Mavericks who had lost five of their last seven games.Two of Dallas’ key contributors, Kyrie Irving and Tim Hardaway Jr., returned from injury to provide key scoring threats, adding 26 and 17 points respectively.",2433,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/sport/luka-doncic-nba-history-mavericks-win-jazz-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207093421-02-luka-doncic-120623.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,honestly player despite lot accessory assist minute seventh return threat rebound icon american dončić court half sole victory lose close eye haircut tim slovenian guard grabbed achieve tie maverick full admit rack ninth chamberlain bird front respectively compete add different contributor emphatic amaze course key remain kyrie multiple fun season fourth game reach finally praise wednesday wilt luka journey jason pretty wore explain high injury head big move coach lively career league energy hardaway past screen history point vital left irving cheer longer possession score time action headband nba airline finish hair jazz play young blowout star provide center dereck knew search create utah dallas away follow great rout extremely kidd shoe larry loud,0.9782500000000001,0.12330456226880394,7.6560323886639665,0.41306965761511216,0
CNN,America is becoming a country of YIMBYs,2023-12-07 10:30:00,Nathaniel Meyersohn,"Public support is building for changes to zoning codes and other laws that have dominated American housing policy for decades and restricted new development.A new Pew Charitable Trusts poll shows broad public approval for several policy initiatives that would make it easier to build new housing, especially apartments.The poll comes amid a severe housing shortage, a loose coalition of grassroots YIMBY leaders — short for Yes in My Backyard — and bipartisan housing policy reform efforts from Utah to Vermont.“The results reflect Americans’ broad concern about housing costs,” Pew Charitable Trusts researchers said in a report.The median home sale price in 2022 was $386,300, up 10.2% from 2021 and the highest on record, and housing construction has failed to keep up with demand. The US housing market is short some 6.5 million homes. Rents reached record highs last year, hitting $2,054, according to Redfin.The Pew poll found strong support for policies such as legalizing accessory dwelling units, commonly known as granny flats, on single-family zoned areas; legalizing duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes; reforms to create affordable housing development near major transit; and simplifying the housing permitting process.Efforts to expedite permitting processes gained the broadest support, with 86%, while at the lower end, 49% approved of the ideas of allowing smaller lots and homes to be built closer together.Support for policies to allow more housing cut across party, region, race, income and gender lines, Pew found. The eight most popular proposals received majority support from Republicans, Democrats and independents. Nine of the 10 policy measures polled received majority support from both renters and homeowners.Republicans and Democrats prioritized housing reform efforts for different reasons in some cases. More Republicans than Democrats identified fewer property regulations as an excellent or good reason for housing reforms, while more Democrats than Republicans chose reducing racial segregation as an excellent or good reason.The poll, fielded in September among a sample of 5,000 US adults, is one of the largest to date on housing issues.And there is evidence suggesting that pro-housing policies are achieving their intended effects, slowing the rocketship of housing prices.In Minneapolis; Portland, Oregon; New Rochelle, New York; and Tysons Corner, Virginia, new zoning rules that allow more housing have helped slow rent growth, according to a study this year by Pew Charitable Trusts. Towns and cities in the same metro areas that did not reform zoning laws generally saw faster rent growth. While rents nationwide grew 31% nationwide from 2017 to 2023, rents in those four cities all grew under 5%, according to the study.Despite the favorable polling on housing reforms, local political opposition to new housing development in single-family neighborhoods often can remain strong. People tend to be supportive of more housing in general, just as long as it’s not right next to them.“One of the tricky parts of housing politics is that a lot of Americans sincerely believe that their city needs more housing but are then unenthusiastic about any specific housing development on their street,” said Salim Furth, a senior research fellow and director of the Urbanity project at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. “A challenge for reformers is to resolve this inconsistency.”For example, Connecticut, Arizona and New York have attempted zoning changes, but efforts have stalled amid blowback. One New York lawmaker warned of a “suburban uprising” if Gov. Kathy Hochul’s plan to build 800,000 new homes over a decade went through. The plan included changes to zoning laws in suburbs near rail stations.Towns, cities and states led by both Republicans and Democrats are loosening zoning laws and reforming other policies in response to the housing crisis.Roughly 75% of land that is zoned for housing in American cities is for private, single-family homes only.In some suburbs, zoning laws make it illegal to build apartments in nearly all residential areas. Some municipalities have also made minimum lot sizes bigger and added height requirements. This has had the effect of encouraging ever-larger single-family homes and limiting housing options, like smaller houses.In recent years, Minneapolis, Arlington, Gainesville, Charlotte, Walla Walla, Washington, and other cities have reformed single-family zoning laws in response to the housing crisis. Oregon, California, Washington, Montana and Maine have ended them statewide.According to an August report from George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, more than 200 housing bills were introduced this year in at least 23 states.",4729,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/business/zoning-laws-suburbs-changes/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap23208696443089.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,slow metro reason lot accessory response sample change record short charitable line public resolve intend broad requirement american mercatus suggest major long encourage illegal independent large reduce portland warn zone project strong arlington senior rule unit built effort shortage restrict hochul furth politics effect fourplexes corner receive law rochelle nationwide amid property sincerely decade study cost remain demand trust polling gender faster gov poll reach legalize bill mason gainesville local evidence accord august grassroots charlotte california chose loose stall price small neighborhood political suburban region construction favorable dwell measure build rail private home million university george duplex republican idea growth market center opposition utah field year expedite arizona result report found racial affordable introduce unenthusiastic leader minimum reflect september walla salim tricky case minneapolis majority code suburb town party make excellent fail city policy tyson flat concern residential crisis apartment popular achieve plan adult limit recent rent believe option support transit fellow reformer lawmaker land date add different part easy kathy research building regulation lead commonly state proposal approve triplexes permit street low renter identify challenge connecticut high big rocketship granny loosening segregation generally york supportive researcher process backyard include grow director virginia specific general prioritize oregon initiative severe urbanity housing simplify approval income coalition cut pew bipartisan race washington hit especially uprise blowback tend reform show median development montana create closer dominate municipality attempt height size yimby area democrat,0.9688,0.19031507718333684,12.551225490196074,0.4293433735214556,0
CNN,China’s real estate crisis is coming for its massive shadow banks,2023-12-07 05:17:00,Laura He,"Moody’s surprise downgrade of China’s credit outlook this week has reinforced concerns that the crisis in the country’s real estate market is spilling over into the wider economy.While the risk of contagion — particularly via losses at so-called shadow banks — is growing, analysts say China is not experiencing a ”Lehman moment,” a reference to the 2008 real-estate linked collapse of the bank that marked a major worsening of the global financial crisis.Even so, investors outside of China should pay attention, says Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, because of the impact on the country’s growth.“The current property downturn has been the biggest drag on the Chinese economy over the past couple years, and also the biggest tail risk at this moment,” he said, referring to something that is unlikely to occur but could still happen.Of particular concern is the spillover effect on the “shadow banking sector,” a mysterious and enormous part of China’s financial landscape.The industry, worth about $3 trillion at its narrowest definition and as much as $12 trillion if asset management products and consumers loans are included, has come under the spotlight in recent months because two major players have failed to make payments they owe to investors. Both of them have significant exposure to the property market.Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, one of the country’s largest financial conglomerates, declared itself insolvent last month after missing payments on dozens of investment products. The company is now at the center of a criminal investigation by the police.Two weeks after Zhongzhi revealed its financial troubles, China’s state media reported that Wanxiang Trust, an investment and asset management firm in Hangzhou, had delayed payments worth several hundred million dollars on a number of investment products.The problems at the two investment companies have fuelled fears about the risk of financial contagion from the worsening property market downturn on investors who did not directly purchase homes. Huge developers such as Evergrande and Country Garden have defaulted on their debt.“Shadow banking generally represented a significant source of capital for real estate developers, and the implosion of private developers is now rocking the shadow banking sector,” said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.Shadow banking refers to financial activity that takes place outside the traditional banking system.In the West, it often involves lending by private equity firms or hedge funds. In China, it involves different forms of financing activity, some of which include banks. Common forms of shadow banking include the use of wealth management products, trust products or entrusted loans.Silvers said the problems affecting shadow banks likely aren’t restricted to Zhongzhi or Wanxiang, adding “a wider meltdown [in the industry] seems imminent.”On Tuesday, shortly after the announcement by Moody’s, S&P Global Ratings also warned that spillovers from China’s real estate industry could reverberate across the economy, either through losses for banks and other financial institutions or through negative effects on investor and consumer sentiment.The shadow banking industry, broadly defined, reached $12 trillion in total size, accounting for 86% of China’s GDP in 2019, according to a report published by the country’s top banking regulator, which was also the first government report on the opaque sector.Trust firms, which pool savings to provide loans, were one of the fastest growing segments in shadow banking during the past decade. The industry has been a popular way for cash-hungry property developers and local governments to raise funds from millions of Chinese.By the end of 2022, assets held by trust firms totalled 21 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion), an eightfold increase from 2010, according to the China Trustee Association.Defaults on trust investment products, especially those linked to real estate, have increased over the past two years. In 2022, real estate trust defaults totalled 93 billion yuan ($13.1 billion), up slightly from 91.7 billion yuan ($12.9 billion) in 2021, according to Chinese data provider Use Trust.Zhongrong International Trust, which is partially owned by Zhongzhi, invests about 10% of its funds in real estate, according to the company. It has lent money to several struggling property developers, including Evergrande Group and Sunac China, which have also defaulted on their debt.Wanxiang Trust also has a sizeable exposure to real estate, with 58% of its assets under management in the sector. One of its troubled trust products invested in Kaisa Group, which defaulted on its debt in 2021 and currently faces a winding-up petition in a Hong Kong court.The liquidity crunch at trust firms may cause turmoil in the local bond market and put financial pressure on Chinese companies and local government entities.Trust firms may need to sell more liquid assets in their portfolios, such as corporate bonds and local government bonds, to prepare for the repayment of trust products coming due, Citi analysts said in an August note.“This could trigger a bond price correction and hinder companies’ financing access,” they said.That could potentially leading to debt-servicing challenges or even default pressure for companies or certain local government financial vehicles that face maturing debt payments in the near term, they added.Local government debt in China has soared largely due to a sharp drop in land sale revenues because of the property slump, as well as the lingering impact of the cost of imposing pandemic lockdowns.Data from the International Monetary Fund showed China’s local government debt reached 92 trillion yuan ($12.9 trillion) in 2022, up 50% from 2019.Among those liabilities — so-called “hidden debt,” which is usually concentrated in local government financial vehicles and do not appear on government balance sheets — might have amounted to almost $10 trillion, according to an October analysis by research firm Mars Macro.China’s shadow banks may be mired in problems, but they’re unlikely to cause a wider banking crisis, according to experts, as they are still a small part of the banking system.“In my view, the recent woes in the shadow banking sector will not lead to a systemic crisis, mainly because the formal banking sector has very limited exposure to these trust companies,” said Hu.﻿“Moreover, trust products are mainly sold to high net wealth investors, not ordinary people,” Hu said.According to Chinese regulations, individuals qualified to invest in trust products must have a minimum net worth of three million yuan ($421,793) or average annual income of no less than 400,000 yuan ($56,239) in the previous three years.Trust assets represented only 5.3% of the banking industry’s assets in the first quarter of 2023, according to CNN calculation based on data from the China Trustee Association and the People’s Bank of China.Trust firms have also been reducing their exposure to the property market. Property trust investments stood at 1.13 trillion yuan ($159 billion), accounting for 5.3% of total trust investments and 0.3% of the banking system’s assets, in the first quarter of this year. The amount was down 28% from the same period last year.“The [contagion] risk is manageable because the trust industry’s property exposure has dropped significantly,” said Ming Tan, director at S&P Global Ratings, adding that he doesn’t believe trust defaults will trigger a banking crisis because wealthy investors and corporates will shoulder the losses.“This gives the government some tolerance for market-based resolutions,” he added.Analysts are also confident that Beijing would step in to prevent widespread damage.“Chinese authorities still have very strong will and capacity to ensure the financial system remains stable despite the property market downturn, because domestic banks play quasi-policy roles and a majority of them have state ownership,” Moody’s said last month.The government has a variety of tools it can use to prevent a domino effect, including the provision of liquidity to distressed financial institutions, they added.Last month, China’s leaders pledged to address risks more systematically across the financial sector and preserve stability.",8335,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/china-shadow-banking-debt-woes-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206162135-money-counting-china-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Business and Economy,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country player significantly raise payment spotlight dozen owe refer increase partially quarter top investigation trillion manageable narrow huge woe remains amount expert hidden mysterious major vehicle tail zhongzhi liquid firm large annual gdp sheet monetary warn reduce define qualify moment trustee strong view china troubled hong restrict address shortly company banking system institution effect represent lehman struggle put traditional property particularly decade cost delayed cnn negative trust yuan spillover reach entrust surprise medium total financial economist global accounting local lent equity accord impose due august broadly insolvent common particular capital prevent past moody outlook price meltdown role small drop experience bond implosion october widespread reverberate reveal net current distressed corporate fast significant private evergrande liquidity slump million home variety west prepare ordinary form play international market limited bank trigger center reference segment soar period confident link macquarie credit year hangzhou publish p debt tolerance hedge declare loss step provision hinder downturn kong held enormous report wealthy pledge preserve leader larry wanxiang minimum despite rock dollar saving ownership criminal liability majority number average provider make estate chief developer fail purchase analysis involves sell formal largely concern crisis shoulder reinforce popular stood kaiyuan access recent industry rating corporates fear correction believe announcement regulator enterprise worsen definition shadow exposure sharp previous sunac pressure wealth directly brock tuesday financing month economy investment land hundred investor analyst add different part data group revenue pandemic loan research refers base regulation term systematically pool sizeable week default lead garden state risk place crunch downgrade worth repayment challenge high portfolio big occur mature sector conglomerate fuel generally consumer stable affect opaque pay include marked grow systemic ming director petition fund lending turmoil drag activity real tool attention impact government give couple money association ensure balance calculation individual concentrate management income chinese miss collapse asset invest especially domestic slightly authority potentially beijing provide problem show eightfold linger invests spill domino wider source mire trouble capacity billion stability product resolution silver size currently officer contagion,0.00655,0.2879424115176964,11.927434343434342,0.3181992125015382,0
CNN,New York Yankees acquire superstar outfielder Juan Soto in blockbuster seven-player trade,2023-12-07 04:47:00,Ben Morse,"The New York Yankees acquired superstar outfielder Juan Soto in a blockbuster seven-player trade, the team announced on Wednesday.The 25-year-old arrives in New York alongside fellow outfielder Trent Grisham, while five players head in the opposite direction to the San Diego Padres; pitchers Michael King, Drew Thorpe, Jhony Brito and Randy Vásquez and catcher Kyle Higashioka.MLB Pipeline – the league’s official portal for grading young players – lists Thorpe as the No. 99 prospect on their Top 100 list; he did end the 2023 season on the injured list with a subluxation in his non-throwing shoulder.Soto is a three-time All-Star who hit 35 home runs and had 109 runs batted in (RBIs) with a .275 batting average last season for San Diego.Soto led Major League Baseball (MLB) with 132 walks, finishing sixth in the National League MVP race after an excellent personal season.“He’s as good an offensive player as there is,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said of Soto before the trade was completed. “He is a machine offensively – on base, power, and has accomplished a ton already at a young age.”After a disappointing 2023 – where they finished 82-80 on the year and fourth in the AL East – Soto could have a transformative impact on the Yankees’ prospects in the coming season.“He’s been one of the rock-solid performers in our sport on the offensive side of the ball, year in and year out,” Boone said.It’s the second trade in as many days for the Yankees, who acquired outfielder Alex Verdugo from the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday in exchange for three pitchers.Soto and Verdugo will likely form a revamped outfield in the Bronx, bolstering a lineup featuring sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton.The Padres acquired Soto before the trade deadline during the 2022 MLB season from the Washington Nationals.

CNN,Harvey Lewis set a backyard ultramarathon record by running 450 miles for four and a half days – while barely sleeping,2023-12-07 04:34:00,George Ramsay,"There came a moment, somewhere on a roadside in rural Tennessee, when Harvey Lewis felt like he could keep running forever.At this point, he had already been on the move, practically non-stop, for about four days, looping around the same roads, trails, and tracks amongst an ever-shrinking group of runners.He was battling through feverish sleep deprivation on leaden, depleted legs, and on the front of his sweat-stained vest he wore the splattered evidence of an earlier nosebleed.But looks can be deceiving, and deep in the corner of his stubborn mind, Lewis knew that he held the golden ticket to winning this backyard ultramarathon race: ensure that every other competitor quits before you.As the race wore on, he began to feel unstoppable.“It was like a frequency I found with my rhythm and my pace,” says Lewis, “where I could just maintain that for an incredible amount of time.“There was some sort of place where my brain took over … and the body finally surrendered to my mind.”This was at Big’s Backyard Ultra in October, the world championships of backyard ultrarunning.The discipline of ultrarunning is broadly defined as any distance beyond the 26.2 miles of a marathon, but a backyard ultra has no predetermined length. Runners complete a 4.167-mile loop on the hour, every hour until only one person is left standing. The other competitors are deemed not to have finished, either by dropping out or failing to complete a loop within the cut-off time.Lewis, a high school teacher and seasoned distance runner from Cincinnati, entered uncharted territory as far as backyard ultras are concerned, completing a scarcely believable 108 loops – the equivalent of 450 miles – over four and a half days at Big’s.His gargantuan feat of endurance and resilience eventually came to an end when his final competitor, Ihor Verys, failed to complete his 108th loop, becoming what’s known in backyard ultrarunning as “the assist.”Several weeks later, Lewis is still trying to get his head around his world record – six laps, or 25 miles, more than Australian Phil Gore’s managed at a backyard ultra earlier this year.“I managed to pull off stretching it to four and a half days,” Lewis tells CNN Sport. “That’s really kind of riveting to me. It sparks my imagination.”In total, Lewis covered the equivalent of the entire length of Florida, or about the distance from his hometown Cincinnati to Atlanta, stopping only for a few minutes between each loop.He was midway through his final loop when it suddenly dawned on him that Verys had finally succumbed to the race’s gauntlet of pain, handing Lewis the victory as long as he could haul himself to the cut-off one last time.“Finishing the final person, you’re on cloud nine,” the 47-year-old Lewis says. “It’s like one of the biggest highs of my life. I couldn’t describe it, especially when it’s such a rigorous, challenging goal.”There are hundreds of backyard ultras staged around the world each year, but Big’s is the discipline’s original and most famous event.The concept was devised by Gary Cantrell, the gatekeeper of some of the world’s most punishing foot races, including the fabled Barkley Marathons. Better known as Lazarus Lake, or simply “Laz” to those in the ultrarunning community, Cantrell first staged Big’s around his farm in Bell Buckle in 2011.The race consists of two different loops: one on trails during the day and another on roads during the night. The start and end of each loop is marked by an overhead structure which reads “there is no finish,” the first three words written by hand and pinned to the banner in crude fashion.It is there that runners must congregate at the top of the hour, every hour in order to stay in the race.“It’s a tribute to a human’s ability to just continually push that boundary of what’s possible further and further out,” Cantrell says in a video promoting the event.Lewis, now a two-time winner and three-time assist, is a dedicated disciple of Big’s. He credits success in this year’s race to a combination of careful preparation, his previous experience on the course and at many other ultramarathons, and sheer force of will in the closing stages.“I always believed that I was going to still be the final person, and I never lost the vision of that,” says Lewis.His training for this year’s race was at times peculiar, especially when it came to managing sleep deprivation. During his lunchtime breaks at school, Lewis would roll out a yoga mat in a storage closet and try to fall asleep for three to five minutes as quickly as possible, simulating the short breaks he would get between loops at Big’s.Other times, he says that he would run to the park and lie down on the grass for several minutes.Come the race itself, Lewis’ sleep strategy hardly went to plan. Unable to quiet his mind the night before, he only slept for three hours and then didn’t sleep at all for the first three days of the race. After that, he was able to switch off for one or two minutes between loops.Thankfully, he wasn’t derailed by the same “incredibly intense hallucinations” that plagued him during a backyard ultra in Australia earlier in the year.“I actually saw these grass people and the trees came alive,” Lewis recalls. “I would fall asleep for just a second, my sense of sound was super accented. It was like that show ‘Stranger Things.’”His strategy if he gets similar hallucinations in another race? “I feel like I would be able to, like, just run through that,” Lewis adds. “It would maybe make it very interesting.”That’s not to say that his sanity remained entirely intact at Big’s: on the fourth day, he started to talk gibberish to the other competitors.“I was semi-conscious, semi-dreaming, and I would just start to say random things,” says Lewis. “I had to censor myself and not just say whatever I was thinking in my dreamlike running state.”He estimates that he consumed more than 40,000 calories during the race, all of which was plant-based – something Lewis says helped to settle his stomach when eating on the move.His race diet was varied and plentiful: avocado and hummus wraps, lentil soup, peanut noodles, vegan mac and cheese, vegan yoghurt, cupcakes, and different fruits – blueberries, mangoes, watermelon – were all on the menu.He also never drank water on the course, instead opting for fluids with calories like coconut water, Coke, or electrolyte drinks.“I was always grazing on foods,” says Lewis, “enjoying my appetite and enjoying the smorgasbord.”An upset stomach is one of myriad challenges a runner might face at Big’s. Another is the risk of a fall – particularly on the roots, rocks, and foliage found on the day-time loop around Cantrell’s farm – while rattlesnakes and copperheads can also make for alarming bystanders on the trails.Lewis fell just once, evidenced by the reddish marks that appeared on the side of his head towards the end of the race. “I’m pretty good at falling,” he explains. “I’ve fallen a lot in my lifetime.”How a runner responds to adversity can be crucial at determining how long they survive at Big’s. Lewis figures that the effort required in the race is about 70% mental and 30% physical, and he has developed unique ways of hardening his mind during backyard ultras.“I have spirit animals that I like to embody in the race,” says Lewis. “With Big’s, I was saying that my spirit animal was the honey badger. The honey badger can be knocked down, beaten, bitten, cut – everything happening to it and the honey badger just keeps on going.”The honey badger analogy can also be extended to Lewis’ ultrarunning career as a whole, his progress in the sport gutsy and gradual. He says that he achieved the qualification time for the Boston Marathon after 17 years of trying and won an ultramarathon 13 years after competing in his first.He describes himself as a “chubby” kid growing up – quite the contrast to the man who these days runs to and from work, adding extra distance as he builds up to a race.“It was an ultra to get to where I am today,” says Lewis.He was running Big’s to raise money for the Brighton Center, an organization in Northern Kentucky which helps individuals and families to achieve financial stability and independence, and also wants to inspire people to invest more in their personal health – even if that means getting outdoors for 20 or 30 minutes each day.And in terms of his personal goals, Lewis has started to reflect on what it might be possible to achieve in the backyard ultra format.“If the opportunity comes again: how will I be able to go through that fifth night?” he muses. “How will I come out on that sixth day, and then will we get back to another night?”Four and a half days and 450 miles might just be the start for Harvey Lewis. This is, after all, a race with no finish line.",8787,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/sport/harvey-lewis-bigs-backyard-ultramarathon-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231205154128-01-harvey-lewis-ultrarunner.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,raise assist believable short australia lazarus line preparation pull settle cover incredibly kind rhythm haul describes enjoy half promote farm lose sort peanut scarcely body moment lewis banner happen closet developed badger rural leg gatekeeper corner maintain sixth day boundary appetite loop course cnn unable plague school extra root honey tribute tennessee total financial kentucky rivet deplete frequency dedicate head back stag mac move evidence structure verys video pin drop experience peculiar october yoghurt estimate careful stand build bell fell harvey simply concerned require knew life original credit closing phil found embody calorie quiet atlanta reflect rock quickly censor endurance accent ultra midway runner battling practically fail hand spirit barkley opportunity ultrarunning achieve plan road ultras discipline family believe brighton gauntlet work mark golden diet previous determine hundred roll mus gargantuan group overhead mango rattlesnake cheese term season goal week ticket personal adversity championship ultramarathons finally wrap challenge food hometown wore entire word earlier suddenly include marked grow cupcake sanity night money vegan order time rigorous race varied equivalent deep show qualification sheer dawn buckle surrender human knock consume stability read community grazing myriad kid lie grass organization splatter lot length enter combination fall asleep dreamlike alarm record top explains complete manage minute succumbed hummus opt win winner gore gibberish describe sound fluid amount track side stop long fabled drank crucial stubborn teacher define similar entirely australian outdoors trail blueberry devise effort unique brain front chubby start ihor write particularly remain slept predetermine push inspire pretty deceive begin derail career broadly foot noodle congregate extend eat coconut mental laz break ultramarathon figure pace beaten sleep finish talk uncharted incredible center feat foliage mind lentil year stranger harden bitten independence held punish tree sport intense water famous felt watermelon copperhead resilience lunchtime feverish person lake fruit crude florida continually consists force make stay competitor switch possible yoga victory alive random boston bystander distance instead quits upset coke simulate hour success cloud northern vest marathon plentiful soup compete concept add progress different park roadside super fourth vision risk place cantrell ability animal feel high big gutsy cincinnati gradual disciple backyard electrolyte stomach run leaden contrast point gary left world ensure hallucination reddish individual recall health avocado storage cut deprivation invest pain especially final today spark responds analogy training physical eventually mile strategy stretch deem territory intact survive,0.9698,0.17070672584499827,7.743314669652857,0.4737520424836603,0
CNN,A deluge of violent messages: How a surge in threats to public officials could disrupt American democracy,2023-12-07 22:33:00,Rob Kuznia,"(CNN) – By the time the FBI first showed up at Kevin Patrick Smith’s home in early February, he’d already left dozens of threatening voice messages for US Senator Jon Tester.“You stand toe to toe with me, I rip your head off. You die.”FBI agents admonished Smith – who lived about a mile from the Montana Democrat’s office in Kalispell – to stop the threats, which were making the senator’s staff members afraid to come to work. But the middle-aged contractor couldn’t bring himself to stop. After 10 days, he resumed the calls in ramped-up fashion, leaving messages that now alluded to guns.All said, Smith left about 60 messages for Tester’s office, sometimes over the din of a TV or radio blaring in the background. Aside from some vague accusations (“you’re pedophiles and you’re criminals”), Smith’s threats contained few specifics about why he was so angry.When FBI agents returned to arrest Smith in late February, they confiscated four shotguns, five rifles, eight pistols, a home-made silencer and nearly 1,200 rounds of ammunition. Smith pleaded guilty to threatening to injure and murder a US Senator and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison.His case is but a drop in a tidal wave of menacing behavior in recent years that has rattled the offices of public servants and is on a path to collide with what is shaping up to be the most politically toxic presidential election in modern memory.As the 2024 campaign revs up – and on the heels of indictments against the Republican frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, who has verbally attacked some of his courtroom adversaries – the ongoing onslaught of violent messages, particularly to federal lawmakers and other public officials, threatens to disrupt the American machinery of government.Though the threatscape to members of Congress and other public servants appears to have cooled in 2022, this year has seen several flareups that could prove a harbinger. They include a recent burst of threats targeting some GOP holdouts in the failed effort to award far-right Rep. Jim Jordan the House speakership, another surrounding Trump’s indictments, and yet another targeting progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar – who has been historically critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians – following the outbreak of the war between Hamas and Israel.Threats have also recently targeted election officials. Last month, staff in election offices in several states received suspicious letters. One of them, in Washington state, contained fentanyl.“These are perhaps the most dangerous hate crimes,” said Anne Speckhard, director of the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism, referring to threats against public officials and election workers. “They’re really scary because they can take down a democracy.”CNN reviewed more than 540 cases involving people who have been federally charged with making threats against public officials or institutions between January 2013 and November 2023. The analysis includes every prosecuted threat CNN could find against public officials or institutions that was announced by the Offices of the United States Attorneys.The lion’s share of those names, including Smith’s, were provided by a research group at the University of Nebraska, offering a rare glimpse into the lives of the accused as well as the names and political affiliations of the targeted. The researchers say nearly 80% of the defendants were convicted.CNN’s analysis – which also includes some cases logged by the Prosecution Project, a database of alleged perpetrators of political violence – shows first and foremost just how rare prosecutions are for people who unleash hostile, abusive or harassing invective at public servants or their family members.In 2021 – a peak year for the activity – more than 9,600 direct threats and “concerning statements” were leveled against members of Congress, according to the Capitol Police. Another 4,500-plus that year were hurled at judges, attorneys, jurors, and others who are protected by the US Marshals Service.The datasets reviewed by CNN showed that, in 2021, just 72 threats against public servants or institutions led to federal charges. Of those, about half were threats driven by ideology, which CNN defines as violent statements made against partisan elected officials, presidential appointees, election workers or against professionals – such as doctors, judges, school officials or law enforcement officers – for reasons connected to hot political buttons such as abortion, LGBTQ issues or police brutality. About 40% of all the cases across the decade were politically motivated, CNN found.(Examples of non-ideological threats include ones where suspects threatened people investigating or adjudicating their cases or threatened to kill people indiscriminately, such as by bombing a school.)Some threats to public officials are also prosecuted at the state and local levels.Officials say the vast majority of hostile messages to public servants aren’t actionable, meaning they don’t meet the legal threshold for being prosecuted as threats.Prosecuting threats could become even more difficult in light of a Supreme Court decision this summer in favor of a Colorado man who argued that his harassing messages to a woman on Facebook – including the phrase “Die. Don’t need you” – weren’t intended as threats and should be protected speech. That 7-2 decision, with Justices Clarence Thomas and Amy Coney Barrett dissenting, reversed a lower court’s ruling based on a less rigorous prosecution standard, which maintained that a threat crosses the line if it puts “a reasonable person” in distress.The Biden administration had weighed in on the case, unsuccessfully arguing in an amicus brief that further raising the bar for prosecuting threats could frustrate the ability of public officials to carry out their duties at a time of heightened political rhetoric.Richard Barron, a former election official in Georgia, received hundreds of vitriolic and threatening messages after the 2020 election, when Trump lasered in on the state during his failed bid to claim fraud.A state attorney general spokesperson told CNN that none of the threats to election officials in Georgia that were referred to and reviewed by the office “rose to the level of criminal conduct or no suspect could be identified” and no charges were filed.“I think Trump gave everyone a license just to say whatever they wanted, make whatever threats they wanted,” Barron told CNN. “I think they knew they wouldn’t get punished for it.”In one voicemail provided to CNN, a man who believed the election was stolen made reference to “Caucasian” founding fathers and said Barron – who is White but managed a majority-Black staff – deserved to be shot or “served lead.”Barron said the threats – along with a GOP-led effort to undermine his office – played a role in his decision to resign as the elections director in Fulton County in the spring of 2022.“My daughter became worried about me,” he told CNN. “My condo has floor-to-ceiling windows and she didn’t want me near the windows where they are overlooking the street.”Barron added that two agents did interview him about the “served lead” threat, but said he hasn’t heard any updates since his departure. John Keller, an official with the election task force established by the DOJ in 2021, told CNN that the hostile message does seem to “meet the definition of a true threat,” but that he couldn’t comment on cases in which charges haven’t been filed. The spokesperson for the Georgia attorney general said the office didn’t receive any information about that particular threat.Katherine Keneally, head of threat analysis and prevention at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said threats to public officials are under-prosecuted. She believes this is due in part to a “resource-strapped” Department of Justice, as well as the challenge of assessing when a threat crosses a line into speech that isn’t protected by the First Amendment.“It’s incredibly difficult, and I do not envy the DOJ’s position,” she said.Though prosecutions are comparatively rare, they are up as well, having risen roughly in synch with the explosion in violent and vitriolic rhetoric overall.CNN’s analysis found that the number of ideologically driven threats against public officials that led to federal charges skyrocketed during the presidency of Donald Trump, nearly tripling the number of threats that were prosecuted during the final term of President Barack Obama (when the dataset begins). The number of threats that led to arrests peaked in 2021 – with more than 40% that year happening in January prior to President Joe Biden’s inauguration – before dropping in 2022.These figures don’t include ideologically or racially motivated threats or acts of violence that target fellow citizens, which have also been on the rise. In the wake of the unfolding crisis in Israel and Gaza, US officials have warned that such threats against Muslims and Jews have spiked; authorities are also on high alert for possible terrorist activity.Threats of violence against public officials or their families not only terrify people, they also play havoc with the legislative process. Jordan’s supporters tormented his moderate GOP colleagues in October in what some said was a concerted campaign to “attack” and pressure the holdouts into voting for Jordan’s ill-fated speakership bid.CNN’s analysis found that in recent years threats of this nature have become more targeted.During Obama’s second term, politically motivated threats to public officials that led to federal arrests were less likely to name names. And when they did, they tended to name Obama himself.Between 2013 and January 19, 2017, the sitting president – Obama – was the target in 71% of all such threats against named public officials, CNN found. During Trump’s tenure, threats to the president fell to 24% of the total to public officials; so far under Biden’s, it’s 19%.Conversely, the number of named partisan targets quadrupled during the Trump era, with threats singling out all levels of public officials, from members of Congress to state election officials to governors and city council candidates. That trend has continued into the Biden presidency.After Trump took office, threats to members of both parties rose sharply.More Republican officials – who were almost never singled out during Obama’s second term – were targeted than Democrats in prosecuted threats during the Trump years (43 Republicans targeted vs. 35 Democrats). However, the number of Democrats who were threatened during Obama’s term – 16 – more than doubled under Trump.US Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger told CNN that threats to certain members of Congress often seem to come on the heels of media stories about them.“Any time a member of Congress is in the news, whether it’s good or bad or just neutral … you will see a spike in threats to that individual member,” he said. “It just gets people to notice.”As president, Biden has borne the brunt of threats lobbed at Democrats, though he’s on pace to receive significantly fewer prosecuted threats than each of his two predecessors.During the combined Trump and Biden eras, Republicans and Democrats were targeted almost evenly: 82 threats leveled at named Republican officials and 80 threats against named Democrats led to federal charges, CNN found.The GOP tends to take fire from both sides, as the Trump years gave way to a lasting surge of threats against members of their own party often labeled as RINO, a term embraced by Trump supporters that means “Republican in name only.” Still, in the cases examined by CNN, it was more common for members of the GOP to be verbally attacked by people whose politics appear to be to their targets’ left.One incident happened in May, when an Oklahoma man went on an 11-minute trolling rampage against Republicans on Twitter, now known as X, that landed him in prison for a year.On the evening of May 15, Tyler Jay Marshall, then 36, posted threatening messages to the Twitter accounts of Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and US Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas that caught the attention of the Oklahoma Information Fusion Center, a criminal intelligence taskforce, which notified the FBI.Marshall, who registered as a Democrat in 2021 and whose Twitter account was created with the email address gopshoulddiesoon@gmail.com, also tweeted a threat at Florida governor and GOP presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis.Marshall, whose lawyer told the court that he does not own a gun, pleaded guilty and was sentenced in mid-October to a year in prison.The attorney, Tyler Box, told CNN that Marshall – who is in federal custody – is a veteran who’d been discharged from the military due to an injury, had recently gotten divorced at the time of the incident and developed a severe drinking problem.“When he would get very intoxicated, he would vent online,” Box said.A judge wrote that Marshall also displayed signs of having an “extreme mental health crisis.”CNN found that the prosecuted threats to US presidents tend to be less coherently partisan than the prosecuted threats made to members of Congress and other politicians. For instance, at least four of the 30 perpetrators charged with threatening Trump during his presidency had also threatened Obama; another also threatened Biden. About a third of the 32 perpetrators who threatened Obama did so while incarcerated; another fifth had documented mental health issues, CNN found.Threat perpetrators often argue that they are exercising their freedom of speech. One of them emailed with a CNN reporter from prison on condition that he not be named due to fears for his safety. That offender views himself as a political prisoner and claims his due-process rights were violated.“At (t)he end of the day I am in prison for WORDS in a country tha(t) pretends to have a first amendment and care about its laws,” he said. “For this reason I no longer trust my government and am scared for my life and the lives of my family if I speek (sic) out.”When it comes to which cases are prosecutable, the specificity of the threat matters – as does the intent of the perpetrator, and the impact it has on the victim. Threats that are more generalized or non-credible often fall within the bounds of protected political speech.“’I’m going to kill you at 12:01’ versus ‘I’m going to kill you,’” said Seamus Hughes, a senior researcher with the project at the University of Nebraska. “If you got a good lawyer, you’re off on the second one.”Smith, who made threats to Tester, the Montana Democratic senator, embodies a few common characteristics of the threat perpetrators examined by CNN. As a 45-year-old who made the threats, he was actually a little older than most perpetrators in the dataset, where the median age was 37.But like dozens of the perpetrators examined by CNN, he was grappling with mental health issues. Smith also was still reeling from a contentious and bitter divorce. Divorce – along with loss of loved ones, solitude and substance abuse – was another recurring theme in the lives of many offenders.The vast majority of the culprits – more than 90% – are male.Quite a few, like Smith, continued to make threats even after being warned by law enforcement to knock it off.One high-profile case this summer involved Craig Robertson, a 75-year-old widower from Utah who brazenly ignored warnings by the FBI to stop making threats online against Trump’s adversaries.Instead, the avid collector of assault rifles and other guns went on to post a barrage of detailed death threats – often alongside photos of firearms – against public officials, including Biden ahead of a presidential trip to the Beehive State.The threats to Biden prompted another visit from the FBI that turned tragic when an agent fatally shot Robertson after he allegedly aimed a gun at them.A similar but lesser-known case began in early 2020, when FBI agents were alerted to disturbing voicemail death threats against California Rep. Adam Schiff. They traced the phone number back to a cheap motel in the desert town of Bullhead City, Arizona, and visited the room in question. Inside was the culprit: 77-year-old Steven Martis, a Vietnam veteran with no family who rode a mobility scooter and had a taste for alcohol, weed and Fox News, according to court records.The agents let him off with a warning.But as with Robertson in Utah and Smith in Montana, Martis seemed unfazed by the admonishment. Five weeks later, he was at it again, this time targeting then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.In mid-January of 2021 – 11 days after the Capitol riot – Martis left Pelosi another venomous message:This time, Martis was arrested; investigators found no firearms in his room (though they found a gun part). He was tried and convicted for issuing threats to public officials, and sentenced to 21 months in prison, despite how his probation report – highlighted in court by his attorney – said Martis did not appear to have the means or intent to carry out his criminal threats.Many threat offenders, however, do have the means – and the apparent propensity – to carry out acts of violence.CNN discovered 60 cases in which threat-makers had firearms confiscated, and at least 44 cases in which people who made threats took additional steps to follow through.The most chilling examples were often people who made threats not directly to the public official in their crosshairs, but indirectly to a friend or family member, who then turned them in to authorities. CNN found at least four such offenders who had gone so far as to drive towards Washington, DC, with weapons in their cars.Among them was Kenelm Shirk III, then a troubled 71-year-old lawyer from a small town in Pennsylvania. On January 21, 2021 – a day after Biden’s inauguration – Shirk became unglued.That evening, during a fight with his ex-wife – with whom he was living – Shirk said he planned to kill Democratic senators and left in his car. The woman called the police, who tracked him down at a gas station 90 miles away. Inside his car was an assault rifle, two handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammo.Shirk was brought in for a mental-health evaluation; a nurse told the court that he relayed his plans to her.Shirk pleaded guilty to making threats to murder Democratic members of the US Senate and was sentenced to time served of 16 months in prison.Although Shirk’s apparent plan never came to fruition, his case highlights findings by Gary LaFree, a criminology professor from the University of Maryland, who has tracked perpetrators of political violence and their co-conspirators.These offenders are, on the whole, better educated, older and more financially secure than people who commit other violent crimes, said LaFree, who works with a database that includes attacks on civilians but does not track threats. (LaFree said the average age of perpetrators in his database is 33. Most violent criminals tend to be in their mid-to-late 20s, according to FBI data.)“They’re not the bottom of the food chain, like the poorest of the poor; they’re more like people who are underachievers,” he said, noting that while socioeconomic status is a good indicator of crime, it’s not as reliable for predicting political violence.Outright acts of physical violence against public officials have been rare in recent years. And culprits in those cases do not always make threats prior to lashing out physically.For instance, neither the right-wing conspiracy monger who attacked Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Pelosi, with a hammer last fall nor the left-wing extremist who in 2017 opened fire on a group of Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game in DC – severely wounding current House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and injuring several others – made explicit threats to public officials prior to those attacks, according to the Secret Service and other authorities.Keneally of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue – a think tank that specializes in researching hate, extremism and disinformation – said while people who commit political violence sometimes make threats beforehand, the more egregious attackers – such as mass shooters – often do not.“They’re not issuing threats to anyone because they are very much focused on wanting to stay under the radar,” she said.However, some who make threats do go on to commit heinous acts of violence. A case in point is Robert Card, a 40-year-old National Guard reservist who murdered 18 people in two successive shooting rampages in Maine before dying of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot.Earlier this fall, Card allegedly accused fellow reservists of calling him a pedophile and threatened to shoot up a drill center at the National Guard facility in Saco, Maine, according to prior reporting from CNN. His threats prompted the Maine National Guard to ask local police to conduct a wellness check on Card, about six weeks before the massacre. Officers were unable to make contact with Card.Related article: Cops were sent to Maine gunman’s home weeks before massacres amid concern he ‘is going to snap and commit a mass shooting’But threats don’t need to lead to violence to cause damage – especially when they come in torrents.Last year, one in five election workers signaled a desire to walk off the job, with more than half of the workers citing safety concerns after false claims of widespread election fraud in 2020 set off a tidal wave of threats.“Just because nobody’s killed – bombs not detonated or triggers not pulled – you don’t need those things to happen to still have a really negative impact on our system,” said Pete Simi, a sociologist and associate professor at Chapman University who coauthored the University of Nebraska study.Notably, the 542 prosecuted threats examined by CNN include few cases involving people who showed up at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, for an immense pro-Trump gathering that culminated in a deadly riot. That’s because the vast majority of the 1,200-plus defendants in those cases were charged not for making threats but for other offenses including disorderly conduct, unlawful entry, assault and seditious conspiracy.However, CNN found a pronounced spike in threat cases in the leadup to and the immediate aftermath of the January 6 attack, underscoring the mass hysteria that made the period so dangerous and destabilizing.Few places were as impacted by this phenomenon as Arizona, which became a hotbed of stolen-election conspiracy theories and threats after the 2020 election.The onslaught was so bad it led to an exodus of election workers, with two-thirds of the state’s counties losing key personnel due in part to the threats made on their lives and families, according to state Attorney General Kris Mayes.“I’m very worried,” said Clint Hickman, a member of the local board of supervisors in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. “We’re losing an incredible wealth of knowledge.”As a result, Mayes – who took office in January – says prosecuting threats to election officials is her top priority.“We’re going to put a stop to that,” she told CNN. “If you do this, you’re going to land in jail.”This summer, one such perpetrator was handed a stiff sentence for making threats against two Arizona election officials in the aftermath of the 2020 election.Mark Rissi, then a 63-year-old resident of Iowa, first targeted Hickman, a member of the Maricopa County board that certified the election amid a high-profile right-wing effort to conduct an “audit” of the results.On September 27, 2021 – less than a week after a private firm conducting the highly controversial “audit” released a draft report affirming Biden’s win – Rissi phoned Hickman’s office from five states away and left a voicemail.He made a similar call to then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, another Republican who’d vouched for the election’s validity.Rissi’s case illustrates not only how threats to public officials can undermine democracy, but also how the radicalization fueling the threats can tear at the fabric of a family.Rissi’s son told CNN that his father’s longtime partiality to conspiracy theories went into overdrive a couple of years prior to Trump’s presidency and only picked up steam after Trump took office.He said his father once bet him $100 that both former President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be hung within 30 days.“How out of touch with reality do you have to be to actually believe that something like that is going to happen?” he said.(Rissi, who pleaded guilty to two counts of sending a threatening interstate communication, declined to comment for this story.)Rissi also fumed about the demonstrations over the 2020 police murder of George Floyd – and how his son had participated in one. Late one night, the father left his son a vicious voicemail.When Rissi took the stand at his sentencing hearing this summer for his threats against Hickman, he struck a contrite tone and pleaded for mercy, claiming he was so heavily medicated with morphine due to chronic back and knee issues that he couldn’t fully remember what he’d said until the FBI played the voicemail back to him at his home.“When I finally heard the recording that I left for Mr. Hickman, I was horrified,” Rissi said, according to a transcript of his sentencing hearing.For his part, Hickman, 58, testified that day about the “nightmare” of enduring a bombardment of threats from many culprits in addition to Rissi.The judge sentenced Rissi to two-and-a-half years in prison, exceeding by six months what the prosecution was seeking.While Hickman had implored the judge to show “compassion” when sentencing Rissi, he told CNN he is satisfied with the decision.“Maybe these judges are understanding the threat to our democracy, and they are going to mete out justice,” he said.To date, the Justice Department, which created a special unit following the 2020 election to prosecute threats of violence against election workers, has filed charges against 20 defendants, Keller said. That includes Rissi, who reports to prison in January.“The department takes this conduct extremely seriously,” Keller said. “Without those election workers, our elections don’t work. And without our elections, our democracy doesn’t work.”It’s too soon to know whether the 2024 election will trigger another tsunami of threats.While there has been no shortage of alarming incidents of late, CNN’s analysis found that threats that led to federal prosecutions actually plunged from a peak of 72 in 2021 to 46 last year. Politically motivated ones also fell in that timeframe from 38 to 20.Also declining last year was the overall number of threats and concerning statements to public officials in at least two big categories.Such messages targeting members of Congress dropped 22% in one year, to 7,500, in 2022 – though that tally is still nearly twice as high as it was in 2017, when the Capitol Police started releasing the figures. Manger told CNN his agency has already investigated 7,300 threat assessment cases this year and is on track to top 8,000.Threats and “inappropriate communications” to judges and other courtroom personnel plummeted 70% in 2022, to 1,362 – the lowest level since 2015, according to the US Marshals Service.Looking ahead, the federal government has begun to weigh in on what to expect in 2024.The Department of Homeland Security released a threat assessment for next year saying it anticipates the threat of violence committed by people radicalized in the US – mostly “lone offenders” – to remain “high, but largely unchanged.”Manger told CNN that his agents are inundated with threat assessment cases, each handling roughly 500 a year. It amounts to a “grueling” workload for the resource-strapped agency as it prepares for a potential spike in threats to federal lawmakers in 2024.“There’s so much hate, vitriol, you know, just hate speech that goes on on social media and elected officials,” he said. “I’m not just talking about here at the Capitol; I’m talking about elected officials all over the country are just targets now more so than I think they ever were.”Regardless of the current trendline, state and federal officials have responded in recent months to a steady drumbeat of unsettling incidents.In May, a 60-year-old right-wing conspiracy theorist left a voicemail in the office of a Texas Congresswoman calling her a “tranny and a pedophile” and threatening to “put a bullet” in her face; the suspect, Michael David Fox, pleaded guilty to making a threat. In late September, another Montana man – this one a 29-year-old whose history of menacing behavior had previously led to the confiscation of his five firearms – was accused of making death threats to Sen. Tester; he agreed to plead guilty. Last month, the offices of two Georgia Republicans in Congress – Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rich McCormick – received death threats; McCormick temporarily closed a Georgia office as a result.All the while, the approaching election and Trump indictments have already proved a combustible cocktail on Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, with Trump himself posting scores of rants, ranging from the vengeful to the dangerous.On June 29, the former president posted what he said was Obama’s home address on the platform. Trump’s message was re-posted that same day on Truth Social by 37-year-old Taylor Taranto, who then posted a comment on Telegram saying “See you in hell, Podesta’s and Obama’s” before driving to the area and live-streaming himself on YouTube walking around Obama’s DC neighborhood. Taranto – who sometimes bragged to his listeners that he stormed the Capitol on January 6 – was arrested by Secret Service agents after a brief pursuit on foot in a wooded area near the neighborhood. They seized from his van two handguns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a machete.Taranto is currently being held at a Philadelphia jail, awaiting trial on charges stemming from the Capitol riot and the June 29 incident. His attorney did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.The day before he showed up in Obama’s neighborhood, Taranto had livestreamed from his van that he was in Maryland and wanted to blow up the National Institute of Standards and Technology. His ramblings included an ominous message for then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whose office had recently spurned Taranto’s request for surveillance footage of the January 6 attack.“Coming at you McCarthy,” Taranto said. “Can’t stop what’s coming. Nothing can stop what’s coming.”",30616,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/politics/threats-us-public-officials-democracy-invs/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170518025807-investigates-logo-specials-page-5-large-169.jpg?q=h_200,w_650,x_0,y_0/w_1280/h_80",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,culprit

CNN,"Facing domestic violence allegations, Von Miller expected to be available to play for Bufffalo this week",2023-12-07 03:52:00,Jacob Lev,"Buffalo Bills linebacker Von Miller is expected to be available to play in the team’s next scheduled game on Sunday, according to general manager Brandon Beane.Last week, Miller turned himself into the Glenn Heights Police Department after an arrest warrant was issued for him.According to the arrest warrant affidavit from the Dallas Police Department, Miller has been accused of assaulting his pregnant girlfriend.Beane told reporters Wednesday that they are comfortable with Miller being with the team moving forward and will follow the National Football League’s (NFL) lead going forward.“Listen, you never want anyone in your organization, no matter what organization you’re in, to have an allegation like that,” Beane said.“That’s a very serious nature and … we’re gonna take every precaution with. Culture and character and all those things are super important. But we also have to remember we have to let the legal process play out. The guy that we’ve known here for a year and a half, that seems out of character.”Beane said the team has been in “constant communication” with the league and does not anticipate Miller being put on the commissioner’s exempt list.“We weren’t there. We’re not the investigators,” Beane said. “We had our conversations with Von (Miller) and understood what he believes happened and so, from that standpoint, we can’t get into it.“It’s an open investigation, and so we’ll just, we’ll let the legal process play out, and he’ll participate like normal in practice.”The NFL told CNN on Wednesday that it will continue to “monitor all legal developments in the matter.”Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Miller wouldn’t practice on Wednesday due to a pre-planned veterans rest day and that the linebacker would practice in full on Thursday.The Bills play the Kansas City Chiefs on the road at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday.",1852,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/sport/von-miller-expected-to-be-available-buffalo-bills-spt-intl/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207031604-01-von-miller-112623-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police allegation available character investigation remember continue conversation gon buffalo schedule sunday glenn chief monitor half forward city culture expect understood normal constant road happen full arrest believe linebacker miller exempt precaution legal assault open practice matter put day kansa affidavit told super cnn football lead week standpoint game participate bill wednesday pregnant mcdermott manager department head reporter move accord coach due process league listen general important veteran anticipate commissioner nfl issue play guy turn national accuse development year warrant investigator dallas beane follow brandon comfortable communication nature height organization rest team,0.8047,0.16198704103671704,8.093582887700535,0.4146825396825398,0
CNN,‘Headquarters of the future’: Plans for Chinese tech firm Tencent’s vast new campus unveiled,2023-12-07 03:00:00,Oscar Holland,"The architects behind Chinese tech giant Tencent’s vast new campus unveiled their plans for the site on Thursday, describing their helix-inspired centerpiece as the “headquarters of the future.”Set to accomodate over 23,000 employees across nearly 500,000 square meters (5.38 million square feet), the campus will be almost twice the size of Apple’s California headquarters when it opens in five years’ time.Digital renderings of the design, shared exclusively with CNN by architects Büro Ole Scheeren, show four towers spiraling out from an open central space dubbed the “Vortex Incubator.” The landmark structure will become the focal point of an ambitious — and largely car-free — “future city” being built by Tencent, owner of messaging services WeChat and QQ, in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.Speaking to CNN via video call, the architecture firm’s founder, Ole Scheeren, said his building’s “swirling vortex geometry” will create an “ecosystem where everything comes together, where work merges into a very collaborative interactive environment.”The German architect’s vision was chosen by Tencent, China’s most valuable publicly traded company, following an international design competition.The lower floors of the scheme, which is named Tencent Helix, connect the office towers via a large lobby and communal educational, recreational, sports and fitness facilities, including basketball, tennis and badminton courts. At ground level, restaurants and shops will erode the distinction between public and private spaceThis layout means that the building “doesn’t have a front and a back,” said Scheeren, who is known for co-designing Beijing’s famous CCTV Headquarters. He added that the structure’s appearance will vary depending on which angle it is viewed from: “It remains very recognizable, but it changes quite a lot in a subtle way.”First unveiled by Tencent in 2020, the wider neighborhood — previously known as “Net City” — is being built on a stretch of reclaimed land jutting out into the Pearl River estuary. It will connect to the rest of Shenzhen via ferries and the city’s subway system. (And although the district is “predominantly car free,” Scheeren said, employees will be able to access Tencent’s headquarters via road bridges linking to parking spaces and drop-off points.)The technology firm’s headquarters will be one of dozens of structures, including schools and public amenities, on the site. While some of the buildings are already under construction, others have not yet had their designs unveiled.To create a sense of cohesion between the new headquarters and its surroundings, Scheeren’s helix motif — which he said evoked galaxies and bands of cloud around the eye of a storm — will extend into a network of pedestrian pathways spiraling out from the centerpiece structure. The new master plan also includes an undulating path that Scheeren said may look “something like a High Line 2.0.”“I found a way, without changing any of the existing buildings, to strategically engage them through a pedestrian network and landscaping — and, in a way, to use the public space as a means to tie the whole master plan together,” he added.The German architect stressed that incorporating nature into his design would offer “connection to outdoor space … but at the same time remain a really functional workspace.”The building will be orientated to benefit from natural ventilation, while a “sponge city” concept — whereby rain is absorbed or captured to protect against storm surges or for use in irrigation — will be employed to reduce water waste.Despite Tencent Helix’s huge floor area, its relatively compact shape sets it apart from many sprawling US tech campuses, which Scheeren described as being “suburban” in design. “I wanted to create something that is more urban,” he said.The architect added that corporate campuses has become “gimmicky,” and that he favored offices that “recognize you as a serious worker and not somebody who’s just hanging around on a beanbag the entire day.”“The office is no longer just a cubicle — but it’s also not a children’s playground,” he said, adding that “to create environments that implicitly tell you can never leave is also a highly problematic approach.”Tencent Helix is expected to open in time for the technology firm’s 30th anniversary in 2028 and will replace the company’s main Shenzhen office as its global headquarters.",4409,https://www.cnn.com/style/china-tencent-helix-shenzhen-ole-scheeren/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210617141412-oscar-holland-2021.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,chosen shop lot dozen basketball depend shenzhen change share back german huge ambitious line motif hang describe public master parking owner shape remains tennis facility natural bridge headquarters jutting firm service large described free büro reduce amenity pearl sponge tower accomodate campus view leave spacethis built china offer company system open front compact undulate storm level cnn remain landscape child school communal global strategically ferry structure fitness benefit foot california cohesion worker video neighborhood technology extend suburban southern construction floor net anniversary beanbag corporate lobby private set sprawl million international site design layout band predominantly exist scheme link year problematic connect playground landmark follow scheeren tech found recognizable water sport famous relatively estuary surroundings rest erode meter central cubicle tencent vortex cctv geometry incorporate surge appearance galaxy founder ecosystem rain court unveiled centerpiece city eye expect favor largely pathway distinction network merges tie access plan road exclusively valuable cloud vary work qq subtle dubbed path giant pedestrian land add concept ventilation architecture environment publicly stress badminton message implicitly river building collaborative highly ground employ vision trade restaurant focal low outdoor wechat evoke high irrigation car replace entire reclaim future vast include educational protect space connection angle engage point architect previously recognize absorbed longer employee swirl chinese time thursday rendering office functional helix beijing show apple create urban gimmicky wider subway square stretch capture district nature spiral recreational call size area interactive orientate,0.9719,0.13608528010886822,10.232771084337344,0.36099120456263306,0
CNN,"UNLV gunman sent letters to university personnel across the country before shootings, sheriff says",2023-12-07 22:14:00,John Miller,"Anthony Polito, the gunman authorities said killed three people Wednesday at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, visited a post office in Henderson and mailed 22 letters to various university personnel across the country with no return address, according to Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill.Investigators are working with the postal inspector and federal partners to process the letters, McMahill said at a Thursday news conference. McMahill indicated they were working to contact the recipients.At least some of the envelopes had a white powder in them, but the substance was found to be harmless, Las Vegas police said Thursday evening. Further details about the letters’ contents weren’t immediately released.Detectives are continuing to process the envelopes and are asking “anyone in the education world” who receives a letter with no return address to “proceed with caution,” McMahill said.The gunman, who died in a confrontation with police, was a 67-year-old career college professor whose online profile paints a picture of a man fascinated by Vegas, puzzles and conspiracy theories.McMahill said police are still trying to understand the gunman’s motive behind the shooting, noting Polito applied and was denied “numerous times” for jobs at different Nevada higher education institutions, the sheriff said.Authorities indicated Polito was struggling financially. When they executed a search warrant at his apartment, an eviction notice was found on the door, McMahill said, noting they found a document he described as similar to a “last will and testament.”Polito legally purchased the weapon used in the shooting, identified as a Taurus PT92 pistol, in Las Vegas about 18 months ago, a law enforcement source told CNN. Polito brought 11 magazines to the scene and had nine loaded magazines on his person at the time of the shooting, McMahill said. Police do not know how many rounds he fired, he added.Authorities found several computers and hard drive components at Polito’s home, along with ammunition consistent with the same cartridges found at the scene and a Taurus box matching the handgun found at the scene, he said.The Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner identified two of the victims as ChaJan Chang, known as “Jerry,” a 64-year-old professor from Henderson, Nevada; and Patricia Navarro Velez, a 39-year-old assistant professor from Las Vegas.The manner of death for both is classified as homicide. The third victim has been identified and the office is working to identify their next of kin.Three patients involved in the shooting have been released from the hospital, while one patient remains hospitalized in critical, but stable condition, according to an updated release from Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center spokesperson Marissa Mussi.No other injuries were reported and the city’s resiliency center is providing support to people on campus affected by the shooting.Polito’s LinkedIn page listed him as a “semi-retired university professor” in Las Vegas.Polito had worked for schools in Georgia and North Carolina, his now-removed LinkedIn page showed. His most recent full-time employment was as a business professor at East Carolina University in Greenville until 2017.His personal website included syllabuses for his past courses but was largely a list of “Resources” with hundreds of links to sites related to his personal interests. While it included ordinary topics like “Travel” and “Shopping,” one section was devoted to “Powerful Organizations Bent on Global Domination!”It included links to common conspiracy theory fodder like Freemasonry, the Trilateral Commission and “The Rothchild (sic) Family.” George Soros, a common target for antisemitic conspiracy theories, is listed as one of the “Great Minds of the Twentieth Century,” alongside Albert Einstein and others.An ECU spokesperson told CNN Thursday Polito worked at their college of business from 2001 to 2017, holding the position of tenured associate professor when he resigned.From October 2018 to June 2022, Polito worked as an adjunct faculty at Roseman University in Henderson, Nevada, Vice President of Communications Jason Roth told CNN. Polito was part of Roseman’s Master of Business Administration program and taught two courses, Roth said.A University of Georgia spokesperson confirmed to CNN Polito received a PhD from the university’s business college in 2002.His personal webpage provided dozens of links related to Las Vegas and said he had made “more than two dozen trips to Vegas over the last fifteen years,” although it was not clear when the statement was originally posted.At least two comments previously posted at his RateMyProfessors page from his time at ECU noted his interest in Las Vegas. “He’s great, we spent over 2 months just talking about Vegas,” stated one comment from 2014. Students’ ratings were mostly positive, but also stated his teaching style was “unconventional” and “unorthodox,” with a heavy focus on personal anecdotes.In his personal biography, last edited in September 2022, Polito claimed to be a member of the high IQ society Mensa.As a professor, Polito had an unorthodox way of teaching and would usually start his classes with stories, frequently about Las Vegas, former student Jonathan Peralta told CNN in a telephone interview.Peralta, a resident of Raleigh, North Carolina, took Polito’s operations class at East Carolina University in 2013 or 2014 and graduated from the university in 2015. He said Polito often talked about Vegas and described the professor as “rather chill.”“This was surprising,” Peralta said of the UNLV shooting. “The Vegas connection is what makes it so crazy because he would talk about Vegas so much.”Peralta said Polito “captivated and entertained students” with his stories, which were most often personal and entertaining and sometimes included life lessons. Polito’s teaching style earned him a reputation for having “easy classes,” Peralta said, though some students felt like it was too personal, and they didn’t learn much.Polito arrived at the university just before 11:30 a.m., and police began receiving reports at about 11:45 a.m. of a shooting at the university, prompting both on- and off-duty law enforcement to rush to the campus, the sheriff said.When officers arrived at the scene, they entered the university’s Beam Hall business school building, where students and professors were preparing for next week’s final exams, the sheriff said.Polito moved through multiple floors and left the building around 11:55 a.m. and confronted university police, where a gunfight ensued, he said.Polito was struck multiple times and collapsed at the scene, where officers then arrested him, McMahill said. He was declared deceased at the scene, he said.Officers immediately started searching the building for additional suspects and located two victims on the third floor and one victim on the fourth floor, McMahill said. The fourth victim was originally shot on the fifth floor but got himself out of the building, where officers were able to take him to an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital, he said.Police do not know how the sequence of events played out in the shooting. McMahill said. There are no cameras in the interior of the building and authorities are working to piece together the details of how this occurred, he said.“If it hadn’t been for the heroic actions of one of those police officers who responded, there could have been countless additional lives taken,” he said.The shooting prompted a campuswide shelter-in-place order as authorities rushed to stop the gunman and then methodically worked to clear the buildings, McMahill said, noting they found groups of students huddled behind many of the doors.“We all walked out of the building, hands up,” the student said. “They evacuated us out of the student union. We walked past one of the windows, the window was shot through, glass everywhere.”The fear and panic on campus evoked memories of the Route 91 Harvest music festival massacre, which took place just miles from UNLV on October 1, 2017, and remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Wednesday’s tragedy marks the 80th school shooting in the US so far this year, 29 of which have been on university and college campuses, according to a CNN analysis.Sheriff McMahill said the training Las Vegas authorities have undergone since Route 91 contributed to how quickly they were able to respond and stop the shooter at UNLV.“After 1 October and all the time and effort and energy that we’ve put in together – in training with the men and women of law enforcement, the fire service and EMS – watching how seamlessly they worked together today made me very, very proud to be their sheriff,” he said.A student was sitting outside and eating breakfast when the shots began, the student told CNN affiliate KVVU.“I heard three loud booms and I was like, ‘Oh, what was that?’” the student said. “Police showed up, then I ran inside.“After two minutes, more shots. I ran into the basements, and I was there for 20,” the student said. “I was just hearing a lot of shots.”Inside Beam Hall, a professor stopped mid-lecture after a loud noise rang out in the building, said student Brett Johnsen, who was in a second-floor classroom. But the sound didn’t initially seem like gunfire, so the professor resumed teaching.“Then an alarm came on,” Johnsen said. “I’ve never heard an alarm like that before, it didn’t sound like a fire alarm.”The students in the class began packing things up, relatively calmly, Johnsen said.“When we began to walk out of the class, that’s when things got real,” he said.The look on his professor’s face turned into panic and he urged the students to get back, lock the door and get on the ground.“If the shooter came into our classroom, we were all just basically sitting ducks,” Johnsen said.A few moments later, the professor opened the door to check that it was clear and told the students to run. Johnsen said he ran as fast as he could down the stairs of the building and outside as far as he could go. Everyone on campus was urging each other to flee and evacuate, he said.“It looked like every single cop in Las Vegas was at UNLV,” Johnsen added.The university has canceled all classes through Sunday but is still considering how the campus will operate next week, when final exams are set to begin, UNLV president Keith Whitfield wrote in a Wednesday post on the school’s website.“Today is a tragic day for UNLV,” Whitfield wrote. “We’re all still in shock as we process the unfathomable event.”“I’m grieving for the victims of today’s senseless shooting, and my heart breaks for the many students, faculty, staff, parents, loved ones and community members who suffered through hours of painful uncertainty while officers ensured that our campus was safe and secure again,” the university president added.President Joe Biden expressed condolences for the families impacted by Wednesday’s Las Vegas shooting and a killing spree in Texas this week. He also called on Republicans in Congress to work with Democrats to pass a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.“Together, we must do more to prevent more families, and more communities like Austin, San Antonio, and Las Vegas, from being ripped apart by gun violence,” Biden said.This is a developing story and will be updated.CNN’s Cheri Mossburg, Eric Levenson, Sarah Dewberry, Sara Smart, Steve Almasy, Gillian Roberts, DJ Judd and Cindy Von Quednow contributed to this report.",11521,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/us/university-of-nevada-las-vegas-shooting-thursday/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230112171909-john-miller-profile.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country grieve employment condition gunfire confront style breakfast manner continue patricia master teach urge remains patient critical develop drive ban service century chajan harvest moment address institution assistant receive einstein law put day express austin told undergone course cnn tragic release multiple edit school travel pack faculty jason robert story conspiracy global biden partner ammunition move condolence texas pistol senseless energy originally cindy prevent history earn mcmahill october violence affected fast set suffer jerry ambulance fascinate uncertainty north george action proud ordinary spree site ensue basement page envelope execute johnsen turn website former search entertain life ran shoot noise understand freemasonry declare gillian shock panic single graduate domination found clear relatively inside interest victim massacre receives quickly struck fifteen resume trip adjunct hospitalize resiliency music roth henderson section proceed hand city deadliest college administration professor heavy largely rush sequence online family fear secure work unfathomable mark support president motive webpage hundred profile part death group chang building love week conference check personal gunman heart smart powder match update union identify legally twentieth injury staff parent note confrontation piece position federal include stair alongside taught puzzle impact methodically played personnel arrive georgia woman sheriff tragedy roseman nevada notice involve hold time order collapse additional postal detail office seamlessly shot provide letter show eviction shopping watch cop east steve numerous list hearing source white magazine anthony communication prompt substance great community organization homicide police heard initially unconventional lot dozen enter respond alarm back minute return glass biography interior sound fire mass weapon dj sunday stop handgun phd shooter unorthodox gunfight described contribute hall similar tenure financially campus content devote arrest enforcement unlv eric peralta effort classroom caution assault duck open struggle vega powerful start lock kevin write cancel syllabus raleigh learn inspector reputation component suspect mail antonio topic san quednow resource wednesday positive route begin consider deny contact accord career event common basically sarah past harmless dewberry eat ripped albert floor commission judd modern break society student operation home university iq box prepare scene republican talk congress polito carolina calmly round affiliate velez sic consistent confirm ago center locate link mind picture year gun immediately hard resident spent post related beam member report spokesperson felt flee huddle marissa exam vice painful decease visit september person associate june program operate fodder whitfield kill examiner ratemyprofessors captivate make ecu surprising campuswide purchase keith antisemitic sunrise apartment lesson medical recent rating festival hour safe county boom education brett trilateral month job mossburg different comment soros easy walk countless fourth state bent rothchild place taurus jonathan evoke high occur claimed window focus stable process hospital document linkedin telephone crazy connection run real previously almasy left world class ensure rang navarro indicate cartridge clark thursday load joe statement brought camera evacuate levenson final authority greenville today news target frequently memory cheri computer apply training heroic theory warrant mile business classify call paint officer democrat loud,-0.9874,0.28643346931689956,10.181437181270283,0.3948911834977408,0
CNN,Opinion: Who won the Republican debate,2023-12-07 13:42:00,,"CNN Opinion asked political contributors to weigh in on the third Republican presidential debate of the 2024 race. The views expressed in these commentaries are their own.The wild, final Republican presidential debate of 2023, filled with vicious, personal attacks by the candidates, demonstrated once again that the nomination is Donald Trump’s to lose because all but one of his challengers are too frightened to take him on directly.Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, identified the stakes early in the debate by going directly after Trump. “The truth needs to be spoken. He is unfit,” he said. “There is no bigger issue in this race.”But the other three candidates failed to follow Christie’s lead, and instead tore into one another.“Nikki, you were bankrupt when you left the UN,” Vivek Ramaswamy said to Nikki Haley early in the debate, accusing her of enriching herself since leaving the government by her ties to big corporations. “You are corrupt.”Later, in case anyone had missed the point, Ramaswamy held up a notepad on which he had scrawled “NIKKI = CORRUPT” in big letters.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis attacked Haley as well, accusing her of bowing to the wishes of her fast-growing network of big-money contributors.“Nikki will cave to those big donors when it counts,” DeSantis charged.Haley tried to shake it off: “I love all the attention fellas, thank you,” she responded, denying the allegations of corruption.But like DeSantis and Ramaswamy, the former South Carolina governor never truly answered the spot-on observation by Christie about the former president and Republican frontrunner: “His conduct is unacceptable. He is unfit.”With a commanding lead in Iowa, where caucus votes will be cast in 40 days, Trump has boycotted the debates, secure in the knowledge that his would-be rivals would largely avoid mentioning him — positively or negatively — in every debate.“This is the problem with my three colleagues: They’re afraid to offend Donald Trump,” Christie said, in the most clear description of the stakes. “You have to be willing to offend with the truth.”For all the insults and attacks, the candidates other than Christie did their best to avoid offending the front-runner. It was, collectively, their one clear success.Errol Louis is a political anchor of Spectrum News, a network of local news channels.Two things were true heading into Wednesday night’s GOP fourth and final presidential debate: former US Ambassador Nikki Haley had momentum and former President Donald Trump remains the frontrunner, despite his legal challenges. After this debate, it seems clear Haley knows ignoring Trump is not an option and she is preparing to take him on.In two of the three early states, Haley has emerged as the clear second place candidate to Trump. In Iowa, a Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa poll showed Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tied at 16%, after a 10-point surge from Haley, and Trump with a 27-point lead. In New Hampshire, a University of New Hampshire/CNN poll last month put Haley at 20% and DeSantis at 9% – and Trump at the top with 42%. In South Carolina, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in October showed Trump at 53% and Haley at 22%, double her nearest competitor.Her success made her an immediate target. As Haley deflected broadsides from DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, she also turned her fire toward Trump, criticizing him by name on issues important to GOP voters, including China and spending.To be sure, Haley could do more to stand up to Trump. No candidate in the race has been willing to take on the former president with more vigor than former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. As he pointed out, Trump is an “angry, bitter man,” and he rightly took his competitors to task for indicating that they could support even a convicted Trump in a previous debate.Two things are necessary for Republicans to dethrone Trump: consolidation of the field and a willingness to take on the frontrunner. We’ve achieved the former – Wednesday’s debate was half the size of the fourth showdown in 2015. Let’s hope this matchup marked the start of the latter.Geoff Duncan, a CNN political contributor and Republican, served as Georgia’s lieutenant governor from 2019 to 2023.If you’re the Biden campaign, you probably didn’t see anything in tonight’s debate that changes the likelihood that former President Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee. What you did see is a Republican field that refuses to take on one of their biggest vulnerabilities in the general election: Their support for abortion bans.There was not a single question tonight about the issue that has defined every election since the fall of Roe v Wade in June of 2022. Republicans can ignore it in their own primary debate, but they can’t ignore it at the ballot box.The Biden campaign should call out that omission, press the issue with media and force the Republican candidates to answer for their extreme positions; they all have past votes and quotes supporting bans of some sort.The president’s campaign can also use any number of moments throughout the evening to reinforce its message that the GOP is Trump’s party and that MAGA extremism is the cost of admission to be a Republican today.Three of the four candidates didn’t speak up to say that Trump promising to be a dictator on day one was disqualifying, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seemed to argue that Trump didn’t govern like enough of a dictator when he was in office and a President DeSantis would fix that. Only former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made a sustained and consistent argument against Trump throughout the debate, as he has in previous debates – and it doesn’t seem to be moving his numbers in the right direction.For the Biden campaign, tonight gave them good fodder to push on issues that are general election vulnerabilities for Republicans and continue to paint the GOP as extreme.Kate Bedingfield served as White House communications director in the Biden administration and was the deputy campaign manager on Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.Nikki Haley came under hostile fire in the GOP debate Wednesday, attacked from all sides by the other candidates. But as in the previous debates, it was Vivek Ramaswamy who went after the former UN ambassador with sexist and ugly attacks.Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s vigorous defense of Haley was a powerful moment. Christie scored big points — and likely made inroads with millions of college-educated women who know what sexism feels like, coming from the likes of an obnoxious smart-mouth like Ramaswamy.Christie remained focused like a laser beam on the absent GOP front runner, former President Donald Trump, who is leading by over 40 points nationally. He tried to goad his three GOP rivals into answering whether Trump was fit to hold the presidency, but none of them would be drawn, no matter how hard he pressed.Meanwhile, Ramaswamy arduously — and falsely — insisted that the 2020 election was stolen. Let’s hope that Ramaswamy, who seems to offend everyone, has made his last showing on a national debate stage. He is not just divisive but — to borrow a term from former President Donald J. Trump — he’s the epitome of a “nasty” man.In addition to being the only woman, Haley looked like the lone adult on the stage. She kept her cool while the male candidates barked and pointed fingers at one another.Yes, Haley took some hits Wednesday night. But over the course of the debate, she played it smart, showing once again that if the GOP hopes to win against Joe Biden next November, she’s the party’s best bet.Sophia A. Nelson is a former House GOP Congressional Investigative Committee Counsel and author of “ePluribus One: Reclaiming our Founders’ Vision for a United America.”In the Republican presidential debate Wednesday night, one candidate was the clear target of most the ire. It wasn’t the far-and-away frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, who didn’t even bother showing up. It was Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador and former governor of South Carolina, who was hit with blow after blow from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.Haley is fair game for criticism. She is, after all, running for president. In New Hampshire and South Carolina, she’s running ahead of all three of the men on stage Wednesday night; in Iowa, she’s neck-and-neck with DeSantis. But the attacks on Haley were less measured critique than hostile indignation, a tone that DeSantis and Ramaswamy seemed to largely reserve for their attacks on her.Ramaswamy was smarmy with everyone, but seemed particularly antagonistic to Haley, whom he has personally attacked throughout his campaign.Despite the barrage, Haley held her own on stage, at one point refusing to even dignify Ramaswamy’s bashings with a response. The audience loved it, laughing and applauding in response.Haley is striking a difficult balance, wanting to come across as a Thatcher-esque figure – a conservative woman who gets things done – without being painted as too feminist, domineering or schoolmarmish. Her dismissal of Ramaswamy fit the bill: She came off as above the fray, while he looked like an irritating child the adults decide is best ignored.But she wasn’t the only one speaking in her defense. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who seems to be running less to win than to be a voice of anti-Trump reason, defended Haley at length from Ramaswamy at one standout moment. This, too, had a gendered element: Christie taking on the role of white knight, swooping into to defend Haley’s honor.Perhaps he would have done the same for any other politician he respected. But the optics – the sense of Christie as a stand-up guy – wouldn’t have been quite as strong.In a vacuum, this GOP debate would suggest that while the party hasn’t moved forward on women’s rights, it has progressed on its treatment of individual powerful women. After all, the three debate moderators were female, and while Haley was dog-piled by DeSantis and Ramaswamy, she wasn’t treated to the kind of hostile sexist attacks and condescension women in politics have so often seen, perhaps most notably 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at the hands of Trump.But Wednesday’s debate was far from the full picture: The most notoriously noxious and sexist candidate, who continues to enjoy the enthusiastic backing of his party and its voters, wasn’t even on the stage.Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis may have had his best debate of the campaign Wednesday night – whether it was too little, too late will be up to the voters. His first answer out of the gate dinged former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley for her distance from the Republican Party base on issues like gender transition surgeries for youth, and he wasn’t afraid to mix it up with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy at various points throughout the evening.But DeSantis’ final answer to a moderator’s question left me questioning to what extent he has learned the lessons of former President Donald Trump. Asked which president he’d most like to model himself after, DeSantis avoided the predictable mention of Ronald Reagan by citing Calvin Coolidge, a favorite of limited-government-type conservatives. “Silent Cal knew the proper role of the federal government,” he said.That may be so. But a Coolidge-inspired approach to federal policy – one that prioritized saying little and focusing on cutting spending – is one better fit for the Republican Party of the tea party era than for the brash, muscular vision embraced by Trump.Applauding “Silent Cal” may win the hearts of conservative wonks, but it suggests that the Florida governor may still hew a little too closely to the pre-Trump consensus to appeal to the former president’s supporters.Patrick T. Brown is a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank and advocacy group based in Washington, DC.Nikki Haley has often sounded like the most commonsense presidential candidate on the GOP presidential debates and Wednesday night wasn’t the exception. There’s no doubt this explains her surprising rise in national polls, challenging Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for second place behind former President Donald Trump.But Haley fell flat at the fourth and final GOP debate Wednesday night at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. For me, the former US ambassador lost major points when the talk turned to war and she responded like a Doomsday despot.According to Haley, America should send troops to “take out the cartel in Mexico.” She said she would take a much different and more aggressive approach to deal with Iran, China, Ukraine and Hamas in Gaza. “We need to make sure that we have full clarity that there is a reason again that the Taiwanese want to help Ukrainians because they know if Ukraine wins, China won’t invade Taiwan. There’s a reason the Ukrainians want to help Israelis because they know that if Iran wins, Russia wins. These are all connected but what wins all of that is a strong America, not a weak America. And that’s what Joe Biden has given us.”For Haley, whose husband, National Guardsman Maj. Michael Haley, is now dispatched in Djibouti in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Horn of Africa, America’s military might is limitless. Yet, her war mongering felt tone deaf considering America’s waning support for military intervention around the world.In every GOP debate, Haley has gained momentum with her sharp intellect and ability to handle herself under attacks. And though, she continued to show she could go toe-to-toe with her critics, it’s doubtful her performance Wednesday night was enough to convince Republican voters that she’s the right woman for the job. In the end, after all the bickering and cheeky insults, it’s seemingly still Trump—polling at almost 60% nationally—whom most GOP voters want to see as their nominee.Roxanne Jones is CEO of the Push Marketing Group and talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia’s WURD radio.During Wednesday night’s fourth and final GOP presidential debate it was interesting to see the clear line drawn down the middle of the stage separating the quartet of candidates into two factions: Chaos candidates stage left – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom have seemingly interpreted the mantra “go big or go home” as an exhortation to triple down on absurd assertions and wild promises – and Gravitas Grabbers stage right – former US ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, seeking to play grownup and look presidential, aiming measured potshots at former president Donald Trump, while trying to fly above the ad hominems and spitballs being tossed cross-stage from the other wing.The split between Ramaswamy and DeSantis was most prominent in the debate segment focused on China. DeSantis warned of China exporting authoritarianism around the world after invading and toppling Taiwan. “The 21st century has to be an American century. We cannot let it be a Chinese century,” he thumped.Ramaswamy, meanwhile, accused Haley of being supported by those who “grovel to China” and said he stood by his bizarre proposal to open a branch of the NRA in Taiwan and give every citizen a gun and training on how to use it, which Christie sarcastically rebutted by noting that the US doesn’t have “constitutional authority over Taiwan to give them a Second Amendment,” before pivoting to a critique of Trump’s China tariffs as responsible for skyrocketing inflation (so it wasn’t just Bidenomics after all!)Haley’s language was similarly restrained, noting that her priorities to rein in China included winning the war in Ukraine, building a pan-Asian regional alliance and moving strategic manufacturing to friendly countries. (And, in an admission that surely won’t play well with the base, she noted that the supply chains for masks and Covid testing both run through China, highlighting their critical importance in combating the pandemic.)Nevertheless, all four were clearly in agreement that China should be seen as America’s enemy number one. Given that a significant number of Democrats also hold that belief, if you’re Asian American and one of the probably few people who watched this debate, the exchange on stage felt like an uncomfortable preview of the anti-China rhetoric that will be employed by members of both parties as a means to unite voters around a common enemy, once campaign season begins in earnest.Jeff Yang is the co-author of the bestselling book “RISE: A Pop History of Asian America from the Nineties to Now.”With sparks flying at each other instead of at the malaise gripping our country, Wednesday’s GOP debate sadly lacked consistent voices offering a bold, strong, positive vision.Much of the debate seemed wasted energy, with candidates attacking one another instead of dissecting progressivism and the Biden agenda, which has resulted in President Joe Biden’s incredibly low poll numbers. Americans hold a dismal view of the president’s governance, as inflation-fueled Bidenomics helps push home ownership out of reach for millions.When the candidates did tackle problems, they offered a smart diagnosis. Both entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis correctly identified what Ramaswamy called “bureaucrats in those three-letter agencies that are writing regulations that Congress never gave them the authority to write,” and DeSantis called out “this massive fourth branch of government, this administrative state which is imposing its will on us and is being weaponized against us.”By reforming regulatory red tape, some economists estimate the US economy could expand by hundreds of billions of dollars each year. But the candidates didn’t offer a more proactive vision of their own formulas for economic success.The debate also saw much talk about Israel and Hamas – and with it another missed opportunity. The candidates wasted a key moment to reach female voters by not pointing to some progressives hypocritically claiming to support women but hedging on protecting Israeli women from rape. This was an opportune time for Republicans to show women who truly stands with us. It is conservatives who offer resolute and unwavering commitment to protect women from bodily harm and sexual degradation.Instead of a circular firing squad, conservatives need greater discipline and focus against Biden to defeat progressivism in 2024 and offer a positive vision of what they stand for, not just what they’re against.Carrie Sheffield is a senior policy analyst at Independent Women’s Voice.During Wednesday’s presidential debate, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy decried what he described as President Joe Biden’s authoritarian streak. “We’re marching toward fascism under Biden,” Ramaswamy declared.That statement was rich, coming the day after a town hall in Iowa at which the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, former President Donald Trump, said he would act as a dictator on “day one” of a new presidential term. “We’re closing the border and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling.’ After that I’m not a dictator,” Trump said.Trump and his allies have also kept open the possibility of renewing his administration’s policy of separating families at the southern US border.The word “dictator” should not be taken lightly by anyone. For many voters, especially Latinos, the word conjures images of authoritarian rulers like Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet — not an American president.I was expecting that the candidates would address what Trump said. They didn’t. Chris Christie called Trump a dictator, and that’s where the discussion ended.In fact, on immigration, the Republican candidates at Wednesday’s debate sounded a lot like Trump. They demonized immigrants, many of whom are Latinos. And they didn’t stay far from what the former president has said he would do: deport huge numbers of migrants and militarize the border.Catch and deport, Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Wednesday, is how she’d handle the immigration question. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis proclaimed he would adopt a policy of shooting on sight any undocumented immigrant crossing the border, who might or might not be a drug trafficker. There was little in any of it that seemed likely to sway many Latino voters to embrace the Republican presidential candidate.According to a recent Axios-Ipsos Latino Poll conducted with Telemundo, 32% of all respondents said neither Democrats nor Republicans care about Latinos. That result would seem to raise the stakes for both parties, as they attempt to win the support of this vitally important bloc of voters.The thinking of the GOP contenders seemed to be that Latinos, a key voting bloc, are abandoning the Democrats for the Republican Party, out of a fear that the Democratic Party’s “wokeness” will lead to some sort of socialist authoritarianism.But, nonpartisan and unaffiliated Latino voters, many of whom are young voters, are fast becoming one of the largest swing voter groups in the next elections. And there was little in Wednesday night’s debate that would lead them – or other Latinos – to conclude that the Republican candidates on the stage, or the party in general, have their best interests at heart.Susanne Ramirez de Arellano, a writer and cultural critic, is a former news director for Univision Puerto Rico.Chris Christie garnered rave reviews for his no-hold-barred performance in the fourth Republican presidential debate. The former New Jersey governor has made taking the fight to former President Donald Trump – who has yet to show up to a debate – central to his campaign, and he did so again on Wednesday.Yet as he reprised his role in the fourth presidential debate Wednesday night, he was unable to dispute a key point made by moderator Megyn Kelly: that broadsides against Trump have done little to diminish the former president’s popularity with Republicans.If anything, Christie has probably damaged his own.Christie even seemed to concede the point. “It’s often very difficult to be the only person on the stage who’s telling the truth,” he replied, seeming to implore higher-polling candidates — who he said may “have future aspirations, maybe those future aspirations are now or maybe they’re four years from now” — to join him in targeting Trump.Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, now locked in a fierce battle for second place, will eventually have to figure out how to resolve this same quandary. A Christie-style full frontal assault against Trump is clearly a political loser in a Republican primary.But to beat Trump, they will have to figure out how to run against him, and their more subtle criticisms of “chaos” or the former president’s age have only gotten them so far.The candidates all complain about the polls, but they can read them as well as anyone else.W. James Antle III is the politics editor of the Washington Examiner and author of “Devouring Freedom: Can Government Ever Be Stopped?”Health care did not come up until the end of Wednesday night’s presidential debate, but the issue has the potential to vex Republicans well into next year’s general election in November. The topic has become a major focus of the 2024 campaign — and the target of attacks from President Joe Biden and his surrogates — after former president Donald Trump declared last week that he would get rid of Obamacare if elected again.None of the answers from the GOP presidential contenders so far should give Republican voters comfort that their nominee, whether it ends up being Trump or one of the contenders on the debate stage, will be poised to adequately rebut those attacks.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis promised a new and better alternative to Obamacare but wasn’t able to provide additional details on exactly how he would lower health costs, which have climbed since Obamacare’s passage in 2010. Nor did he appear able to offer consumers more choice, something that the law has curtailed.Vivek Ramaswamy made some valid points about a lack of transparency in our health care system but offered few specific ideas about how to address this weakness. And his indulgence of crazy conspiracy theories distracted from any strong answers he may have given.Republican candidates would be smart to get smart on health care issues, and fast. There’s no dearth of ideas from conservative policy analysts and thinkers offering market-based reform on specific ways to expand incentives for health savings, increase transparency in health spending, and lower costs. These would all be ways to improve the health system in ways that Obamacare did not and cannot.Lanhee J.

CNN,A Texas man is accused of killing his parents near San Antonio and then 4 people in the Austin area. Here’s what we know,2023-12-07 13:32:00,Christina Maxouris,"A man in custody in central Texas is suspected of fatally shooting his parents near San Antonio this week before traveling to the Austin area and killing four people and injuring three others in an eight-hour span Tuesday, authorities said.The suspect, Shane James, 34, was arrested in Austin on Tuesday night, and is charged with capital murder in one county with more charges expected in another, authorities said. James had mental health issues for years, one sheriff said Wednesday, and had previously been arrested on suspicion of assaulting his family members.As authorities in Travis and Bexar counties work to piece together how the brutal violence unfolded and whether the suspect had any connection to the victims outside his parents, the affected communities are now forced to confront the all-too-familiar grief of gun violence in the US and live with the lifelong trauma it leaves behind.Here’s what we know about the killings in Texas.James is believed to have shot and killed his parents at the family’s San Antonio-area home sometime between 10 p.m. Monday, when a sibling reported last talking to them, and 9 a.m. Tuesday, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said.The parents were Phyllis James, 55, and Shane James Sr., 56, the sheriff said.Several gunshots were fired from a “large caliber handgun,” the sheriff told reporters on Wednesday. He urged anyone in the area who may have heard or seen anything in those hours to contact authorities.Investigators believe the suspect then traveled about 80 miles to the Austin area in Travis County, where the rest of the violence unfolded throughout Tuesday before James was arrested, authorities said.Bexar County authorities didn’t know about the deaths of the suspect’s parents until Tuesday night, when Austin police – having arrested James in the Texas capital – contacted Bexar County because they’d connected him to his family’s San Antonio-area home, Salazar said.Deputies went to the home after the message from Austin police. The deputies saw water running from under a door and forced their way into the home, where they found the suspect’s parents inside a small room, Salazar said. The sheriff described the crime scene as “grisly” and said this had been a very “quiet family.”In the Austin area, police responded to a shooting just after 10:40 a.m.An Austin Independent School District police officer was shot, sustaining a non-life-threatening wound, while on duty at a school campus, the district’s interim superintendent, Matias Segura, said in an online post Wednesday.The officer is recovering at home, Segura said, adding that “his swift response was key in keeping our campuses safe.”Just before noon, Austin police responded to reports of a shooting about a 12-mile drive from the school, police said. There, officers found two people with gunshot wounds: Emmanuel Pop Ba, 32, and Sabrina Rahman, 24. Pop Ba was pronounced dead at the scene, and Rahman was taken to a hospital, where she died, police said.It’s unclear what their connection was to each other or the suspect.Hours later, at roughly 5:47 p.m., police responded to a call about a 39-year-old male cyclist shot about 6 miles from the second crime scene. The cyclist was taken to a hospital and has since been released and is recovering from his injuries, police said.At about 6:48 p.m., authorities responded to a burglary call, Austin police said, at a home just about 2 miles from where the cyclist’s shooting was reported.Police found James in the home’s backyard, and the suspect “immediately fired several gunshots” at an officer, who returned fire but suffered multiple gunshot wounds, police said. The officer was taken to a hospital, was released and is recovering from his injuries.The suspect fled the scene in a vehicle and officers pursued him, Austin Interim Police Chief Robin Henderson said. The suspect crashed the vehicle around 7:14 p.m. and was arrested, the chief said. He had a firearm on him, Henderson added.Inside the home involved in the burglary call, two people were found with “fatal injuries” and pronounced dead, police said. Police didn’t immediately release the names of those two people or specify how those injuries were sustained.The suspect was booked in Travis County jail and is charged with counts of capital murder, the Travis County district attorney’s office said. James is expected to remain in custody pending his trial, the office said.He was also booked on an outstanding warrant that had been issued on accusations of assault and family violence, Austin police said.“Based on information obtained over the course of these investigations, we strongly believe that one suspect is responsible for all of these incidents,” Henderson said.James was arrested in January 2022 on three misdemeanor assault charges, and the victims are believed to have been his parents and a sibling, Salazar said. The assault allegations involved “pushing” and “scratching,” Bexar County District Attorney Joe Gonzales said.The suspect’s family told the sheriff’s office a few days later he “has mental health issues” and did not belong in jail, Salazar said.The conditions of his bond were altered and James was released from jail on March 7, 2022. A day later, he cut off his ankle monitor, the sheriff said. “Those three charges then became warrants for his arrest,” he added.On June 6, 2023, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill into law making it a state jail felony for anyone to tamper with or remove a required ankle monitor. The legislation was a response to calls for action after violent crimes committed by people required to wear ankle monitors as a parole condition – including the deadly shooting at Methodist Dallas Medical Center in October 2022.In August 2023, deputies were sent to James’ house for “a mental health episode,” Salazar said. The suspect was upset and insulting to the deputies and would not let authorities inside his bedroom. Deputies eventually left and asked the suspect’s father to call so they could return and arrest James, but they were never called back, the sheriff said.“It’s always possible that we could have done more,” Salazar said Wednesday about the summer incident, but said deputies were “making every effort to avoid a violent confrontation.”James is expected to be charged in Bexar County with murder or capital murder “in the next day, maybe the next day or two” for his parents’ killings, Salazar said.“It appears, by all accounts, he suffered with mental illness for some years,” the sheriff said in a Wednesday news conference. “From what the family members are telling us, he’s had mental health issues for some years based upon some of the history that we’ve seen.”The suspect was also in the military but was discharged “due to some sort of a domestic violence incident in the military,” Salazar said. The sheriff said his office found about the military discharge on Wednesday.The suspect served as an Army infantry officer from February 2013 to August 2015, according to an Army spokesperson.James had no deployments on record, Lt. Col. Ruth Castro said Wednesday. His last rank held was a first lieutenant, which is typically held by officers with 18 to 24 months in uniform.He separated from the Army on August 17, 2015.CNN’s Lauren Mascarenhas, Ashley Killough and Haley Britzky contributed to this report.",7343,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/us/texas-killings-thursday/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231207085545-04-texas-shooting-1205.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police allegation heard pronounce army respond response condition wound record confront firearm investigation back return lieutenant burglary fire urge alter gunshot interim book trial charge greg handgun monitor drive custody vehicle independent rank large pursue described accusation contribute sort gonzales discharge leaf campus arrest deputy effort britzky assault lauren law travis day responsible phyllis austin told course key remain release multiple gov push unfolded crime suspect school insult antonio travel san salazar room bill roughly wednesday shane avoid pop reporter contact methodist accord due august information texas live parole capital military fatal specify small bond history castro october violence affected mental legislation suffer james tamper home sign scene action talk javier ruth grief center require obtain bexar year gun duty shoot immediately connect span post dead swift member held report found water typically sibling january flee rest injure quiet deployment inside victim belong central recover june ashley strongly male kill force make henderson cyclist jail chief sabrina possible emmanuel haley brutal expect fatally crashed abbott illness medical upset online family killing hour commit believe superintendent work county rahman caliber lifelong tuesday wear month add attorney ankle death message base robin matias incident week conference state suspicion misdemeanor remove serve sustain injury parent grisly monday piece backyard felony include infantry trauma hospital pending episode connection run mascarenhas killough scratch outstanding noon previously night left father murder account sheriff february health deadly involve cut joe issue house bedroom office domestic authority shot violent news unclear count summer warrant eventually mile dallas march separate district community segura call area officer,-0.9988,0.3268418902355985,9.8436678700361,0.2975510204081633,0
CNN,Jimmy Kimmel pays emotional tribute to the ‘genius’ of Norman Lear,2023-12-07 00:49:00,Brian Lowry,"An emotional Jimmy Kimmel paid tribute to the late producer Norman Lear at the top of his ABC show on Wednesday night, calling him “one of the most important and impressive people I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.”Kimmel, having teamed with the producer, who died Tuesday at his home at the age of 101, on the ABC specials “Live in Front of a Studio Audience,” hailed Lear as “The genius who brought us some of the greatest television shows and characters of all time.” He proceeded to list many of them, such as “All in the Family” and “Maude,” adding, “It’s an incredible list, and he was an incredible person. He changed situation comedy in the best way possible.”Kimmel continued, “Everyone who works in or even watches television owes him a great debt,” noting, “101 years, and somehow it wasn’t enough.”After reading an amusing thank-you card that Lear had sent him, the host said that Lear didn’t like to say goodbye but rather “To be continued,” so he closed by simply saying, “To be continued.” “Jimmy Kimmel Live” then proceeded with an on-screen disclaimer before the show that mirrored the one CBS – skittish about how viewers would respond – displayed prior to the first episode of “All in the Famiy” in 1971.Kimmel appeared alongside Lear on “Live in Front of a Studio Audience,” which presented actors performing live versions of episodes from Lear’s classic sitcoms, including “All in the Family” and “The Jeffersons.”Lear became the oldest person ever to win or be nominated for an Emmy, at 98, for producing the specials with Kimmel.Tributes to the producer poured in throughout the day after news of his death. All the broadcast networks featured a memorial card honoring Lear to kick off their primetime lineups on Wednesday night, which showed his picture and simply read, “Thank you for making us all family.”Separately, Lear’s widow, Lyn Lear, sent along a message to the Sentinel Awards, an event honoring TV writers whose work has dealt with significant issues. The awards are presented by Hollywood, Health & Society, which is based at the Norman Lear Center, a research center that Lear endowed at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.Lear was proud of the center, Lyn Lear wrote, “And he would not have wanted all of us to mourn. He would want us to celebrate the important shows you are honoring tonight, and most of all, he would want us to laugh.”In a 2020 interview, Lear said he never thought of his shows as “edgy,” despite their groundbreaking aspects, noting, “We were simply dealing with the problems that existed in our culture.”",2625,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/entertainment/jimmy-kimmel-norman-lear-tribute/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180930003531-brian-lowry-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,tv despite respond lineup person change top goodbye pleasure character win writer celebrate make version special edgy proceed maude continued reading card sitcom impressive close primetime culture memorial network perform feature audience paid interview famiy broadcast family classic separately sentinel situation work producer hail groundbreaking tuesday front add mourn deal day abc death honor message write research studio norman base kimmel emmy cbs school lear wednesday host tribute viewer endow present jimmy skittish note kick prior live include event aspect amuse disclaimer california mirror late alongside episode important southern night produce significant society health home university television displayed proud brought issue genius owes hollywood incredible simply award news dealt show center problem exist watch emotional picture widow year list debt nominate age tonight communication lyn great annenberg read call actor comedy team,0.9878,0.45714285714285713,7.566556169429095,0.5383699633699636,0
CNN,Fact checking the December GOP debate,2023-12-07 00:07:00,,"Four of the Republican presidential candidates made a variety of false, misleading or lacking-in-context claims on Wednesday during the fourth debate of the 2024 party primary.Former President Donald Trump did not participate in the debate. Here is a fact check of some of the claims from the candidates – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – who participated in the debate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.Ramaswamy went on a rant against the so-called “deep state” and promoted a widely debunked conspiracy theory about the January 6, 2021, insurrection during Wednesday’s GOP debate.“Why am I the only person on the stage at least who can say that January 6 now does look like it was an inside job?” Ramaswamy said.Facts First: This is one of the most pernicious right-wing lies about the January 6 insurrection. It’s false, unsupported by any real evidence, and has been repeatedly rejected by FBI Director Christopher Wray, a lifelong Republican appointed by Trump.This particular conspiracy theory emerged in summer 2021 in a series of articles and TV segments from pro-Trump news outlets. The false and self-serving narrative claims the US government orchestrated the US Capitol attack, sending undercover FBI agents to trigger the violence, so they could frame Trump supporters and make Trump look bad.The supposed evidence backing up the theory is nothing more than a conspiratorial web of unproven claims, half-truths and inaccurate drivel from Trump supporters who have aggressively tried to absolve him of responsibility for the deadly assault that day.“If you are asking whether the violence at the Capitol on January 6 was part of some operation orchestrated by FBI sources and/or agents, the answer is emphatically not. No. It was not violence orchestrated by FBI sources or agents,” Wray said last month.About 850 rioters have been convicted of crimes stemming from January 6, according to the Justice Department. Most of them pleaded guilty, and many acknowledged that they were at the Capitol because they supported Trump.Ramaswamy has a history of peddling disinformation about January 6. At a campaign event last week in Iowa, he falsely claimed “the cops were just letting them in,” referring to the rioters. Here’s a previous CNN fact checkfrom January 2022 on this specific lie.From CNN’s Marshall CohenHaley’s rivals attacked her policy proposal to push social media platforms to require name identification on social media and ban anonymous posts on the platforms.Haley disputed this claim from the debate stage, saying, “What I said was that social media companies need to show us their algorithms. I also said there are millions of bots on social media right now. They’re foreign. They’re Chinese. They’re Iranian. I will always fight for freedom of speech for Americans. We do not need freedom of speech for Russians and Iranians and Hamas.”But her rivals DeSantis and Ramaswamy quickly and loudly pushed back. “That is false,” Ramaswamy said.Facts First: What Haley said is false: she did initially propose banning anonymous speech for “everyone” on social media platforms and later walked back that proposal to focus on foreign-actors online.Haley did propose to ban anonymous posts on social media and require posters to be verified by their name on social media, saying on Fox News in November that, “Every person on social media should be verified by their name. It’s a national security threat.”Following blowback for her proposal from right-wing media and her rivals, Haley walked back those comments the following day by proposing that foreign-based actors, not US citizens, should be banned from posting anonymously, though she did not specify how she would require social media companies to identify those users.From CNN’s Em SteckDeSantis claimed that the Biden administration wants a “central bank digital currency,” saying that the president “want[s] to get rid of cash, crypto, they want to force you to do that. They’ll take away your privacy.”Facts First: The Biden administration has not officially proposed a policy of a “central bank digital currency,” but it has commissioned the government to study what the future of money and cryptocurrency would look like.In March 2022, President Biden signed an executive order requiring government agencies to create reports assessing the risks and benefits of creating a “central bank digital currency” or a digital dollar.Six months later, the Biden administration released a framework for its approach to digital currency that encouraged agencies to conduct further research. The Federal Reserve has yet to announce whether it will implement a digital currency.From CNN’s Em SteckHaley said during Wednesday’s GOP debate that younger people can’t afford a home and “the banks aren’t lending them any money; they’ve made the regulation so hard that they don’t want to give loans on mortgages anymore.”Facts First: Haley’s claims need more context.Mortgage rates have spiked during the Federal Reserve’s historic inflation-curbing campaign of dramatic monetary policy tightening, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage surpassing 7% in August and hitting as high as 7.79% in October. As of last week, mortgage rates averaged 7.22%.Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasuries, which move based on a combination of anticipation about the Fed’s actions, what the central bank actually does, and investors’ reactions.When Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates.High mortgage rates are among several factors that have contributed to the US housing market becoming the least affordable since 1984. Historically low inventory has resulted in prices rocketing higher and tighter credit standards have made lending more difficult.Banks and other lenders have tightened their lending standards in recent months following the financial turmoil this spring and the rising interest rates. In October, rejection rates for credit applications grew to 20.1% in 2023, up from 18% in 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Available credit for a mortgage has fallen to its lowest level in a decade. Demand for loans has also dropped considerably as well.Homebuyers are finding it harder to qualify and obtain loans, but banks have not stopped issuing mortgage loans altogether.From CNN’s Alicia WallaceDeSantis claimed during the debate that “I did a bill in Florida to stop the gender mutilation of minors. It’s child abuse and it’s wrong.”Facts First: The claim that gender affirming care is “gender mutilation” or “child abuse” is false based on the opinions of most major medical associations that consider gender affirming care medically necessary, evidence-based care.Gender affirming care, a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition away from the gender they were assigned at birth, is not “abuse” or “mutilation” according to the medical community. It is a recommended practice by most major medical associations. The American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry – agree that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults.Research shows that gender-affirming care can greatly improve a person’s mental health and well-being.For children, gender-affirming care is considered “crucial to overall health and well-being” for transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents, the US Health and Human Services Department Office of Population Affairs says.In May, DeSantis signed into a law that made it more difficult for adults to seek this treatment and banned this care for children.Delaying, or denying care, can exacerbate stressors and health problems for kids, research shows. Gender-affirming treatment builds self-esteem and improves overall quality of life, according to the US Office of Population Affairs, and peer reviewed studies show that the care improves general well-being. The American Academy of Pediatrics also says that gender affirming care is developmentally appropriate, nonjudgmental treatment that’s provided in a safe clinical space. The care is individualized and based on peer-reviewed scientific studies that show its effectiveness.Surgery is not “mutilation” and not every person who identifies as transgender or nonbinary will choose surgery. Surgery is usually done as one of the later steps in gender-affirming care experts say. No medical or surgical interventions are considered for prepubertal children. Some adolescents may choose what’s commonly called top surgery, which for transgender men and nonbinary people that removes breast or chest tissue, but the surgical choice would be rare. Generally, experts say, these are not procedures adolescents would need. The Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health guidelines say that genital reassignment surgery should be reserved for adults only. Adults who have the surgery report high rates of long-term satisfaction with the procedure. Studies show those adults who have had surgery had a significant reduction in psychological distress and other mental health issues.From CNN’s Jen ChristensenDeSantis vowed during the GOP debate on Wednesday to “open up all of our domestic energy for production” to “lower your gas prices.”Facts First: As he did on Wednesday, DeSantis’s frequent campaign claim that the US can lower gas prices by producing more domestic oil is misleading.Under Biden, US oil production has reached a new record this year, even surpassing output under former President Donald Trump. As CNN has reported, the US currently produces more oil than any other country on the planet, at about half a million barrels per day more than the prior annual record set in 2019.Prices at the pump in the US are highly dependent on the global oil market and the US cannot be truly energy independent when it comes to gas prices, energy experts have told CNN. Oil is a global commodity; the global price of oil determines US gas prices and it’s simply impossible to separate that price from shifting global dynamics like Russia’s war on Ukraine or OPEC’s recent decisions to cut oil production.There’s also the fact that the US consumes a different kind of oil than it produces, Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, and a former George W. Bush White House official, told CNN last year. McNally compared the light crude the US produces to champagne, and the heavy crude it imports to coffee. US oil refineries are specifically built to separate out the “heavy and gunky” crude we consume, McNally said.From CNN’s Ella NielsenDuring a discussion about US policy toward Israel, DeSantis made a claim about the American death toll from Hamas’ massive October 7 attacks in Israel, which killed about 1,200 people in total.“If you looked at this terrorist attack and the number of Americans, this would be one of the top 10 terrorist attacks in American history,” DeSantis said. “So, our own people were killed in that attack. And I think it’s absolutely appropriate to point that out.”Facts First: DeSantis’s claim is correct based on available terrorism statistics.There aren’t robust statistics that go back to America’s founding in 1776. But the Global Terrorism Database, maintained by the University of Maryland, contains detailed information about terrorist attacks that have occurred in the US since 1970.The US State Department said in mid-October that Hamas killed at least 32 American citizens in its sweeping assault in southern Israel. Available data from the Global Terrorism Database indicate that, as DeSantis said, this would’ve been among the top 10 deadliest terrorist attacks if it happened on US soil.In addition, some US citizens were taken hostage during Hamas’ attack in October. While four American hostages have been released since the start of the war, the White House has said there is still one American woman and seven men unaccounted.From CNN’s Marshall CohenDeSantis said during Wednesday night’s GOP debate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, “I banned China from buying land in the state of Florida.”Facts First: This needs context. The law signed by DeSantis prohibits most land purchases in Florida by Chinese entities and individuals (who are not US citizens or permanent residents), but the law did not completely ban all land purchases by these entities and individuals – as DeSantis’ categorical claim here may have suggested to debate viewers.DeSantis signed a bill this year that prohibits the ownership of real property in Florida by the Chinese government, its ruling Communist Party, members or officials of either the government or the party, other organizations based in China, or “any person who is domiciled in the People’s Republic of China and who is not a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.”But the law contains an exemption for Chinese individuals who have been granted asylum in the US or are on a US visa that is not a tourist visa. Those individuals are allowed to make one purchase of a residential property, of up to two acres, if the property is more than five miles from a military installation.From CNN’s Kaanita Iyer and Daniel DaleDeSantis claimed some progressive members of Congress, known as “the Squad,” called for the US to “import 300,000 people from the Gaza strip.”Facts First: This is misleading. While some progressives have signaled that the US should join other countries in accepting refugees, they haven’t floated a specific number.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a “Squad” member, told CNN’s Abby Phillip in October that while other countries in the region may be able to support Palestinian refugees, it “does not abdicate the United States from our historic role that we’ve played in the world of accepting refugees and allowing people to restart their lives here.”The UN reported in October that more than 300,000 people have been displaced in Gaza, but CNN could not find evidence that any of the members of the “Squad” advocated for accepting a specific number of refugees.From CNN’s Kaanita IyerChristie claimed in the Republican debate Wednesday that it was untrue that he signed a law the moderator characterized as requiring schools to “accept a child’s preferred gender identity, even if the minor’s parents objected” which would allow “the serious issue to remain a secret between the school and the child.”Facts First: Christie’s claim was true, but it needs context. In the debate, he argued that the law was put into effect and regulated in 2018 after he left office and that he did not issue the guidelines as the moderator was suggesting.What Christie did was sign a bill into law in 2017 that required the state’s education commissioner to create guidelines that would help schools understand what best practices would be in managing its transgender student population to include how to address what names and pronouns school staff should use when referring to a student. It also allowed students to dress in a way that was consistent with their gender identity, among other trans-inclusive policies. In the months prior to signing the bill, Christie had said that each school should handle the matter on its own. Later, when he signed the bill it was without comment.The guidance the moderator referred to was not released when Christie was in office. Instead, the guidance was released in 2018 under the next governor, Democrat Phil Murphy.From CNN’s Jen

CNN,Controversy hangs over climate talks as countries weigh whether to ditch fossil fuels,2023-12-07 01:03:00,Angela Dewan,"The first week of the COP28 climate talks has come to an end not with the euphoria of the first days of breakthrough announcements, but with growing anxiety about whether the world will do anything about the main cause of the climate crisis: fossil fuels.The trade-show-like pavilions — where countries have for days been touting everything from zero-carbon shipping to nuclear fusion energy — are slowly starting to empty. One European nation’s pavilion had just three staff members left late Wednesday morning, all rushing out to catch a flight home. Another representing climate vulnerable states had its lights switched off, no one at all inside.The summit’s glamorous early days are over. What’s left now is the tedious, hard work between countries’ negotiators who are sorting the thorny issue of what to do about fossil fuels — pursuing what could potentially be the most ambitious COP outcome in years.But journalists, delegates and civil society groups are still talking about the summit’s president, whose recent remarks cast a shadow over the negotiations.Comments from Sultan Al Jaber that came to light on Sunday sent shockwaves through Expo City in Dubai: In a late-November panel discussion, he said there is “no science” behind the demand to phase out fossil fuel to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius – the goal of the Paris climate agreement. Al Jaber, who is also an oil executive, fiercely defended his commitment to climate science the next day, and said phasing out fossil fuels is “inevitable” and “essential.”Days later, UN climate chief Simon Steill was asked by a reporter about Al Jaber during a news conference Wednesday, but refused to be drawn on the controversy, saying his focus was now on the summit’s critical negotiations.US climate envoy John Kerry fended off similar inquiries. Kerry has publicly supported Al Jaber’s COP presidency several times, but chose not to wade into it at a press conference Wednesday. He had earlier told POLITICO that Al Jaber’s remarks perhaps “came out the wrong way” and could use a “clarification.”Getting climate action on the same page as the science has never been more urgent; 2023 will officially be the hottest year on record, and even scientists are expressing alarm that the climate impacts they’re seeing are outpacing their predictions. The planet’s average temperature this year is on track to be around 1.4 degrees above pre-industrial levels — just a hair below the Paris Agreement’s threshold.The impacts of the climate crisis weigh heavily on attendees at the talks — but there are now concerns among civil society groups and some delegates that Al Jaber’s remarks may bleed into the negotiations themselves.“The whole COP has been a conflict of interest,” said Isabel Rutkowski from Germany, part of the European Youth Forum. “It’s frustrating because the science is pretty clear, and you have a president for COP who is not following science. It’s crazy.”Whether Al Jaber’s comments will have an impact on final language around fossil fuels is yet to be seen, but countries are deeply divided over the issue.The latest draft of the summit’s key agreement included several options: One called for a phase-out of fossil fuels –— the language widely supported by most climate scientists. Another called for a phase-down of fossil fuels, which is weaker language and leaves the door open for a future with more planet-warming pollution. Another option was to omit language on fossil fuels altogether.The Mexican delegation is supporting a phase-down of fossil fuels, Benjamín Murguía, a technical advisor to Mexican negotiators, told CNN, given the difficulties of getting a “phase-out” through the country’s parliament back home. The delegation doesn’t disagree with all of Al Jaber’s comments, but Murguía said it finds the controversies unhelpful.“It’s frustrating,” said Murguía, who wanted to see more progress and “action” and fewer distractions.“Mexico is a highly vulnerable country and we’re facing that as our own fight,” he said, pointing to Hurricane Otis, which killed dozens of people and tore through coastal cities. “We’re trying to rebuild Acapulco now.”Reaching consensus on fossil fuels was always going to be a tough fight. The UN’s Stiell said Wednesday that there was a “spectrum of positions” on the issue among the nations at the summit.Two sources who were in the room for a late-night drafting session told CNN the US, China and Saudi Arabia all requested a large number of changes to the draft before it was published. Those countries’ negotiators were told to “take a scalpel” and be surgical with the text.A delegate from the Philippines, which represents the G77 nations — a coalition of developing countries — described the US as taking a “broadsword” to the agreement, with nearly 200 edits or comments, the sources said.Some of India’s delegates expressed reservations on phasing out fossil fuels, according to the sources, but the country has previously supported a phase-down.CNN is reaching out to the US, China, Saudi Arabia and India.Al Jaber’s influence over talks may become clearer next week, when ministers and senior officials join other delegates and discuss this language openly in public sessions, said Tom Evans, a policy advisor in climate diplomacy and geopolitics for the E3G climate consultancy.And the controversy could, ironically, bring positive outcomes, he said.“The fact that we have had so much scrutiny on the fossil fuel industry and on the comments on the fossil fuel transition is actually, maybe helpful in putting them under the spotlight and saying, ‘If things do go south, we’ll be pointing at the UAE,’” Evans said.He cautioned that there were several other countries that were blocking progress on including a fossil fuel phase-out, and that failure in that regard wouldn’t solely be the UAE’s doing.“But, we do see that pressure now playing into the discussions, constructively,” he said.",5949,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/climate/cop28-fossil-fuels-al-jaber-controversy/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/local/231129103056-2023-cop-and-beyond-logo-large-169.png?c=original&q=w_1280,c_fill/h_80",Climate and Environment,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country european vulnerable climate evans negotiator clearer spotlight dozen change alarm record sultan edits frustrate arabia back ambitious outcome catch public request saudi critical track discus mexico develop sunday forum shipping large pursue described dubai otis sort warm similar rebuild leaf slowly senior diplomacy china wade caution pavilion broadsword open regard represent draft start wrong put panel day express uae told key cnn level acapulco demand executive solely reach room wednesday cast inquiry tom defend global positive pretty reporter coastal inevitable jaber accord heavily john controversy oil energy chose nation late fusion tedious stiell scientist drawn rutkowski prediction simon planet society expo benjamín home geopolitics action hair talk commitment mexican play politico page murguía helpful constructively light delegate fight press remark hottest bring civil year hard publish weaker nuclear follow surgical paris glamorous tout member officially deeply weigh clear negotiation bleed official shockwaves scrutiny interest difficulty fiercely morning number kill euphoria average pollution kerry phase flight chief discussion switch presidency city policy tough celsius early crisis concern rush influence session refuse recent industry degree announcement journalist work shadow option support parliament pressure president science summit steill germany progress minister part empty comment publicly group find failure highly delegation goal advisor week conference fact state outpace join staff omit consensus anxiety temperature fuel envoy focus earlier position future include grow india point transition impact previously give left world youth tore widely technical coalition disagree time attendee issue fossil urgent final news hurricane philippine potentially agreement cop reservation scalpel spectrum block thorny language divide source conflict south fend breakthrough ironically openly call isabel,-0.6214999999999999,0.302571860816944,9.901902222222219,0.3932773936020689,0
CNN,"December 7, 2023 Israel-Hamas war",2023-12-08 00:00:00,Kathleen Magramo,"Our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war has moved here.Editor’s Note: The following post includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.Simchat Greyman had to pause several times when describing the evidence of sexual violence he saw when recovering the bodies of victims of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel.One body was so severely brutalized that he and his colleagues from ZAKA, the ultra-orthodox Jewish human remains recovery organization, couldn’t tell whether it was a man or a woman.Greyman described finding a woman who was shot in the back of her head, lying on her bed, naked from her waist down. A live grenade was planted in her hand.And then there was the body with the nails.“I was called into a house, I was told there are few bodies over there. I saw in front of my eyes a woman, laying (down). She was naked and she had nails …,” Greyman managed to say before pausing for a long time, struggling to get the words out.“She had nails and different objects in her female organs. Her body was brutalized in a way that we could not identify her,” he added, the trauma clearly visible on his face.Greyman was testifying at a United Nations session on sexual and gender-based violence in the October 7 Hamas terror attack, hosted by Israel at the UN headquarters in New York on Monday.He was one of several eyewitnesses invited to address the meeting, providing evidence that sexual violence and rape occurred and were weaponized by Hamas during the attacks.CNN cannot independently verify individual allegations and claims. However, several first responders who attended the scenes of the October 7 attack told CNN the attacks were overwhelmingly gruesome and that some female victims were found undressed.The evidence of sexual violence presented during the session at the UN was ample and overwhelming and came from different sources.While Greyman spoke about his experience from the search and rescue operations, Yael Richert, a superintendent with the Israel Police, shared information gathered during the investigation so far.She said survivors of the terror attack told investigators they witnessed Hamas terrorists perpetrating sexual violence against the victims. She quoted testimonies of several individuals all of whom either directly witnessed sexual violence or saw clear evidence of it.Read more about the rape and sexual violence inflicted by HamasThe humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate in Gaza as Israeli forces expand their operations throughout the Palestinian enclave.Since Tuesday, the military has been operating in the southern city of Khan Younis, engaged in “intense battles” with Hamas fighters.The conflict has caused “unimaginable loss, destruction and misery” and “everyone in Gaza is hungry,” the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said.Israel’s security cabinet on Wednesday approved a “minimal” increase in the amount of fuel entering Gaza, but global leaders and aid groups say there needs to be much more assistance entering the enclave.Here’s what to know:The Israeli military in the early hours of Friday local time responded to an allegation that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deployed white phosphorus in southern Lebanon on Thursday.The Lebanon National News Agency (NNA) alleged Thursday that Israeli artillery shelled the outskirts of the town of Rmeish, south Lebanon, with “phosphorus.”Video obtained by CNN shows columns of white smoke above the outskirts of the hilltop town. CNN is unable to confirm the use of phosphorous munitions.In a statement to CNN, the IDF said that it “only legal weapons and ammunition.”Is white phosphorus illegal? Under an international protocol ratified by Israel in 1995, the use of such incendiary weapons is allowed when “not specifically designed to cause burn injury to persons,” CNN previously reported.There is no prohibition, per se, against white phosphorus in conflict. But the timing and location of its use are restricted.For example, it is illegal under the protocol to use white phosphorus against any personnel, civilian or military. It can be directed only against military targets. International law says incendiary weapons cannot be used where civilians are concentrated.Israel’s history with white phosphorus: Israel previously faced widespread criticism for firing white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during a Gaza offensive that began in late 2008. HRW said in a 2009 report that Israel’s white phosphorus munitions had killed and injured civilians and damaged civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse, and a hospital. HRW claimed that Israel’s use of the weapons in crowded neighborhoods “violated international humanitarian law (the laws of war), which requires taking all feasible precautions to avoid civilian harm and prohibits indiscriminate attacks.”In response, Israel pledged to limit the use of white phosphorus and make greater efforts to protect civilians during conflicts. Still, the government said that it had used white phosphorus lawfully.Claim of recent use: In October, Human Rights Watch accused Israeli forces of using white phosphorus during military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.According to the HRW report, the rights group said it verified one video taken on October 10 in Lebanon and another video in Gaza on October 11 that it claimed shows “multiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border.”Israel denied the claims by Human Rights Watch.An Israeli man presumed to have been held hostage in Gaza was killed on October 7 when Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel, his kibbutz announced in a statement Thursday.Kibbutz Be’eri announced the death of resident Dror Kaplun, 68, but did not specify when Israeli authorities informed the kibbutz about his death.It is not clear where he was killed.CNN has reached out to the Israeli prime minister’s office for more details.His wife, Marcel Frailich Kaplun, was also killed on October 7, the kibbutz said at the time.After the October 7 attack, the hostages’ families forum released a statement saying his children saw a video in which Kaplun and his wife were seen taken by militants and tied up toward the fence of the kibbutz.Egypt will not let Palestinians temporarily relocate to the country while Israel carries out its military operation in the Gaza Strip because it would be a violation of international humanitarian law, the foreign minister said Thursday.Some context: The United States has also objected to any efforts to move Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip. Vice President Kamala Harris said in a meeting Saturday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi that Washington will not allow for the forced relocation of Palestinians or any redrawing of the current border of the Gaza Strip.“Under no circumstances will the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, the besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza,” Harris said, according to a statement from the vice president’s office.More from the interview: Earlier Thursday, the Egyptian Authority for Crossings and Borders published a list of dozens of foreign nationals set to leave Gaza. Pressed on why it took so long to get those people out of the enclave, Shoukry said it’s all contingent on agreements.“It is totally up to Israelis to define and to provide the lists of those who can come out, and when they do we facilitate the repatriation. So, this is all to maintain the Rafah crossing, not to affect at all the flow of humanitarian assistance,” Shoukry told CNN.The list included more US citizens alongside nationals of Romania, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. It also includes 13 United Nations personnel intending to enter Gaza.Shoukry also said he thinks “it is necessary for the Palestinian people to demonstrate who they will accept as governance of the Gaza Strip.”When asked by Tapper whether Palestinian people would be better off with a group other than Hamas, the foreign minister said it would be up to the Palestinian people to decide.Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.The exact circumstances and dates of the detentions are unclear, but some of the detainees’ identities were confirmed by colleagues or family members.At least some of the men are civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a conversation CNN had with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor posted an image of one detainment and said in a statement on its website Thursday that “the Israeli army detained and severely abused dozens of Palestinian civilians.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on the images. CNN has geo-located some of the images to Beit Lahia, north of Gaza City.The Israeli media, without indicating a source, has portrayed the images as the surrender of Hamas members.“We investigate and check who has ties to Hamas, and who does not,” he said. “We arrest them all and question them. We will continue dismantling each one of those strongholds until we are done.”In a statement Thursday, news outlet The New Arab, or Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, said one of its correspondents and several members of his family were among those detained as part of the incident portrayed in the images.“Today, Thursday, the Israeli occupation army arrested the journalist and the director of ‘The New Arab’ office in Gaza, our colleague Diaa Al-Kahlot, from Market Street in Beit Lahia, along with a group of his brothers, relatives, and other civilians,” Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote.“The occupation deliberately forced Gazans to take off their clothes, searched them, and humiliated them when they were arrested before taking them to an unknown destination, according to what the people there told us,” he said.Hussam Kanafani, the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed editor-in-chief, said in the statement that Al-Kahlot and his family were still missing.“We will make every effort possible, in cooperation with international institutions and organizations concerned with the rights and freedom of journalists in the world, to determine the whereabouts of our colleague Diaa and release him as soon as possible,” Kanafani said.CNN spoke with a relative of another detained men, Hani al-Madhoun, from his home in the United States.“Israeli forces arrived on the street and called out all the men to come out, and they complied,” al-Madhoun told CNN. “This house was their place of refuge after our two homes were destroyed.”Al-Madhoun said he was in contact with his sister, who is in Gaza.He said he recognized his cousin Aboud in one of the photographs and saw his brother Mahmood in a video. He said that Mahmoud is a shopkeeper and Aboud “is not involved in any activities; he helps his father in construction.”US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday described how US pressure has resulted in incremental progress from Israel in protecting civilians and allowing aid into Gaza.Blinken noted that after each of his trips to Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government shifted toward the US position.The top US diplomat noted that on his first trip to Israel, in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 Hamas attack, “we made the case for the imperative of getting” aid into Gaza.“After we left, that assistance started to flow,” he said at a news conference at the State Department alongside UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron.He said on his second trip, the focus was on emphasizing how “humanitarian pauses could be beneficial in getting hostages out, getting more assistance in.”“Well, shortly after we left that’s also what happened,” he said.On his most recent trip to Israel last week, Blinken stressed the need to protect civilians and pressed the Israeli government not to carry out its offensive in south Gaza in the same way it did in the north. He also stressed the need for sustained humanitarian assistance.“What we’ve seen over the initial days is some important additional steps in the direction of doing just that,” Blinken said.Still, the top US diplomat reiterated that there remains a gap between the “intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground.”Israel says it will open the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza for the inspection of aid trucks in the “next few days” as the United Nation’s aid chief hailed the “promising signs” pointing toward this development.Col. Elad Goren made the announcement during a news briefing Thursday organized by Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, more commonly known as COGAT.He did not specify whether the trucks will be allowed to travel to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing itself after the inspection or whether they will need to travel through the Rafah crossing in Egypt, which is already being used to facilitate aid deliveries.“We will open Kerem Shalom just for inspection. It will happen in the next few days,” Goren said.Goren, who is head of the Civil Department at COGAT, said it would be essential to open the crossing if Israel wanted to inspect more than 200 trucks a day bound for Gaza.A few hours later, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths told a briefing in Geneva that there are “promising signs” indicating that the much-debated crossing would “be able to open soon.”Griffiths also did not provide any details regarding what role exactly the crossing would perform if opened.The UN has been calling for several weeks for the crossing to be opened, saying it would facilitate deliveries of more vital humanitarian aid to Gaza.US President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday to discuss the latest developments in the war between Israel and Hamas.During the conversation, Biden reiterated the need for Israel to protect civilians, according to a readout of the call from the White House.Biden also told Netanyahu that more aid was “urgently required across the board,” according to the statement.The president additionally relayed “deep concern” for hostages still being held in Gaza, telling Netanyahu that Hamas’ refusal to release young women civilian hostages is to blame for the breakdown in the humanitarian pause last week.Israeli and US officials believe Hamas continues to hold hostage a number of women between the approximate ages of 20 to 30 – many of them kidnapped from the Nova music festival – CNN previously reported. Hamas insisted that some of the remaining women they were holding hostage were considered part of the Israel Defense Forces, which Israel denied.More on the leaders’ calls: Per CNN’s count, it’s the 16th call between the two leaders since October 7, and the first since November 26.On Wednesday, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby was asked in the White House news briefing why the two had not spoken since November, Kirby said he “wouldn’t read anything into that.”“I just wouldn’t read anything into the fact that there hasn’t been a conversation in recent days. There absolutely will be additional conversations between the two. I have no doubt about that,” Kirby told reporters.The Israel Defense Forces on Thursday released a satellite image and video it said showed Hamas rocket launches next to a “humanitarian zone” and United Nations facility in southern Gaza.Because the IDF satellite image of the rocket location is cropped, and the video is cropped and low resolution, it is not possible for CNN to corroborate its location.“Hamas is the enemy of humanity and makes itself a threat to the entire world,” the IDF said on X, formerly known as Twitter.Some context: Along with the allegation, the IDF released a map showing the “Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone,” encompassing a large swath of southwestern Gaza. But in a post on X with the same allegation, the IDF posted a map showing a far smaller humanitarian zone, encompassing just a small neighborhood near the UN facility. And in a post on X earlier this week, the IDF’s Arabic language spokesperson referenced the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone without any map indicating its boundaries.The Palestinian Authority should be granted the ability to govern both Gaza and the West Bank — but it is still too early to discuss any details, Egypt’s foreign minister said Thursday.Sameh Shoukry said that it is “a matter that should be addressed by the Palestinian people,” and Egypt believes the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization are the “legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people.”Shoukry, speaking at an event in Washington, DC, hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that it is still early and premature to decide what will happen in Gaza since the conflict between Israel and Hamas is still ongoing.His comments come ahead of a Friday meeting between top diplomats from Arab states and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, DC.The foreign minister’s comments echo remarks by US President Joe Biden, who said last month that the Palestinian Authority should govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank following the war.In stark contrast, on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Palestinian Authority assuming power in Gaza won’t happen for as long as he is prime minister.“Whoever educates their children for terror, funds terror and supports families of terrorists, could not control Gaza after we eradicate Hamas,” Netanyahu wrote on social media.Some background: The Palestinian Authority is a government body with limited self-rule in the West Bank. It was established in the 1993 Oslo Accords, a peace pact between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization that saw the PLO give up armed resistance against Israel in return for promises of an independent Palestinian state. It has recognized Israel and engaged in multiple failed peace initiatives with it. Hamas controls Gaza and presents itself as an alternative to the PA.CNN’s Catherine Nicholls and journalist Tamar Michaelis contributed reporting to this post.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it is striking targets in Syria and Lebanon after missiles were reportedly launched toward Israel from those countries on Thursday evening.Two missiles launched from Syria landed in an open area in the town of Buq’ata in northern Israel, according to the IDF.The IDF also said it identified “a number of launches” from Lebanon toward the areas of Shtula, Malkia and Zar’it also in the northern part of the country. The launches led to sirens sounding in Golan Heights and Zar’it.The IDF said it is striking the sources of the launches.Earlier on Thursday, the IDF said that Israel Air Force fighter jets struck an “operational command and control center” in Lebanon belonging to Hezbollah after launches were detected coming from the vicinity.The World Health Organization (WHO) managed to deliver supplies to two hospitals in southern Gaza that have not received any deliveries since November 29, according to the organization’s director general.“Today WHO delivered trauma and emergency care supplies to European Gaza Hospital and Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza to cover the needs of 4500 patients,” WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on social media platform X.The WHO chief highlighted the detrimental impact of the “intense fighting” in southern Gaza, saying the fighting has made it “increasingly difficult to run any health operations” there.Since Tuesday, the Israel Defence Forces have been engaged in “intense battles” with Hamas fighters in Khan Younis city in southern Gaza.Video obtained by news agency Reuters on Thursday showed a slew of injured Palestinians rushing into the Nasser Hospital in the city following a barrage of Israeli strikes.Ghebreyesus reiterated that his organization remains “extremely concerned” about the thousands of “patients, and health and care workers” in Gaza, stressing that the only way to protect them is by immediately implementing a ceasefire.An overnight Israeli airstrike killed 18 family members of Dr. Munir Al-Bursh, director-general of the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza, the ministry said Thursday.Several of the bodies arrived at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza as Al-Bursh was on shift there Thursday morning, according to the health ministry.Al-Bursh told CNN his 1-week granddaughter was among those killed.Video from the hospital shows Al-Bursh kneeling on the ground before bodies wrapped in sheets. At least five covered bodies can be seen in the video.Al-Bursh uncovers the face of one of the deceased, an adult male, and touches his face, the video shows.He said the man is his nephew, a university professor with a law degree, days shy of obtaining a doctorate in international law, who “everyone knows for his kindness.”He said his father is the Undersecretary of the Hamas-run Ministry of Justice in Gaza.At least 634 people crossed into Egypt on Thursday through the Rafah border crossing, officials said, including more than 400 dual nationals.This is a breakdown of who exited Gaza into Egypt on Thursday, according to the Rafah Crossing Authority:It added that a total of 70 aid trucks have entered Gaza, including a load of 79,000 liters (nearly 21,000 gallons) of fuel.There are “promising signs” that the Kerem Shalom crossing linking Israel to Gaza may be opened for humanitarian deliveries, according to UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths.“We’re still negotiating,” he said, adding that the crossing has been a “feature of discussion these many weeks.”“There are some promising signs now that that may be able to open soon,” he added.What is Kerem Shalom: Before the war that started in early October, Israel had two crossings with Gaza: Erez, which is for the movement of people, and Kerem Shalom, for goods. Both were heavily restricted and have been shut since the war began. During the brief truce between Israel and Hamas, the Kerem Shalom crossing was used to transfer Israeli hostages from Gaza to Israel.During the two-month conflict, the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt has been the strip’s only entry point to the outside world. Aid to Gaza has trickled through this crossing. It is the only Gazan border crossing that isn’t controlled by Israel.Take a look at where the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings are located:Israeli forces in recent days have arrested and questioned hundreds of suspects in Gaza allegedly involved in terror activities, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said on Thursday.He also said that Israeli forces are “advancing the fighting” in Hamas strongholds in the southern and northern Gaza Strip.On the Israel-Lebanon border: Following the death of an Israeli civilian in northern Israel from an anti-tank missile from Lebanon, Israeli fighter jets struck “a series of terror targets” of Hezbollah on Thursday — in which several operatives of the militant group were killed, he claimed.Israeli military is on a “high alert” in the country’s border with Lebanon and “will severely respond to any terrorists act against Israel,” Hagari said.The United Nations aid chief has said that the organization’s operation in southern Gaza is unable to function properly.“Our humanitarian program is no longer a functioning one. It is one of response to opportunity,” UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths stressed Thursday.Meanwhile, the pace of the Israeli military operation is a direct “repeat of the assault in northern Gaza,” Griffiths said.Since Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces has been operating in the southern city of Khan Younis, engaged in “intense battles” with Hamas fighters. Video obtained by the Reuters news agency Thursday showed a slew of injured Palestinians rushing into the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis following a barrage of Israeli strikes.“None of us can see where this will end. None of us can see where the people crammed into that southern pocket of Gaza will go — those 2 million people,” Griffiths said.The Israeli prime minister said Wednesday that Israeli forces had surrounded the house of Yahya Sinwar, potentially closing in on the top Hamas official in Gaza – and the man most wanted by Israeli authorities.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sinwar was not in the house and was believed to be hiding underground in Gaza, but a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that it was “only a matter of time before we get him.”Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the “mastermind” behind Hamas’ terror attack against Israel on October 7 — though experts say he is likely one of several — making him one of the key targets of its war in Gaza.A longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas’ military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group’s civilian and political leader.He was elected to Hamas’ main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in the Gaza branch. However, he has since become the Politburo’s de facto leader, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).He has been designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State since 2015 and has been recently sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France.Early days: Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. His family was displaced from a Palestinian village during the Arab-Israeli war.He joined Hamas in the late 1980s and became one of the founders of its feared internal intelligence apparatus, known as the Majd.He was convicted in 1988 of playing a role in the murder of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians suspected of collaboration with Israel, and spent more than two decades in Israeli prison.Sinwar later said he had spent those years studying his enemy, including learning to speak Hebrew.Back in Gaza, Sinwar has risen through the ranks and quickly became a key player within Hamas. He became known for his brutality and the violence he inflicts on anyone he suspects of betrayal or collaboration, said Harel Chorev, senior researcher at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University.Learn more about Sinwar and why Israel calls him a “dead man walking.”King Abdullah II of Jordan called for an “immediate ceasefire” and emphasized the need to protect civilians in Gaza in a phone call with US President Joe Biden on Thursday, the Royal Hashemite Court said in a statement.King Abdullah II also expressed deep concern that the humanitarian situation could worsen significantly if military operations persist, the statement said. The conversation also delved into ensuring the swift delivery of humanitarian and relief aid to Gaza.The leaders discussed the importance of coordination to bring an end to the ongoing war and establish lasting peace, according to the statement.The king also reaffirmed Jordan’s rejection of any attempts to forcibly displace Palestinians within or outside Gaza, and opposed any endeavors to reoccupy parts of the strip.Investigations by two news organizations and two human rights groups made public on Thursday say that Israeli tank shells killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and injured six other journalists in southern Lebanon in October.The reports by Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch drew on forensic analysis, witness testimony and interviews with government officials, lawyers and medical professionals.The findings are in line with a CNN analysis of the events conducted at the time. A CNN team that was nearby in southern Lebanon reported at the time that the projectile that hit the journalists on October 13 came from Israel.CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the allegations.Eylon Levy, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, said Thursday that he was “not familiar” with the new reports.IDF spokesperson Richard Hecht on October 14 called Abdallah’s death “a tragic thing” without naming him directly or acknowledging Israel’s involvement. The same day, the IDF said, “A report was received that during the incident, journalists were injured in the area. The incident is under review.”AFP and HRW claim in their reports that the strike was a “deliberate,” targeted attack by Israel on the journalists. In a statement to Reuters, Hecht said, “We don’t target journalists.” He did not provide further comment, the news agency reported.Abdallah, 37, was killed and six other reporters were wounded while filming the Israeli border from southern Lebanon. AFP photographer Christina Assi had her leg amputated and remains in the hospital, according to AFP.After analysis of weapon fragments found at the scene, the reports say the journalists were killed and wounded by a 120mm tank round of Israeli origin “that is not used by any other groups in the region.”According to official statements and CNN’s video analysis and geolocation of the incident, at least six other journalists from AFP, Reuters and Al Jazeera all wearing body armor clearly labeled as “press” were injured in the blast.Amnesty International’s investigation did not find “any indication that there were any fighters or military objectives at the site of the strikes.”What the United States is saying: The Pentagon continues to urge Israel to protect innocent civilians, including members of the press, but it has not conducted its own assessment of the death of the Reuters journalist.Singh said the protection of civilians and the need to uphold the laws of armed conflict have repeatedly come up in both public and private conversations with Israeli officials.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the incident should be investigated. The top US diplomat said it was his understanding that Israel has begun such an investigation, and stressed the importance of seeing it through.CNN’s Oren Liebermann and Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting to this post.This post has been updated with the latest comments from the Pentagon and Antony Blinken.The US has now resumed drone flights over Gaza in support of Israel’s hostage recovery efforts, a Pentagon spokesperson said, after pausing them last month as part of a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas.Israel and the US had been flying surveillance drones over Gaza for weeks before the temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.The British government announced on Saturday that it will also begin conducting surveillance flights over the eastern Mediterranean and Gaza to help locate the hostages, which include British nationals.“Surveillance aircraft will be unarmed, do not have a combat role, and will be tasked solely to locate hostages,” the UK statement said, adding that “only information relating to hostage rescue will be passed to the relevant authorities responsible for hostage rescue.”Israel Defense Forces said Friday that there are 136 hostages still being held in Gaza, including 17 women and children.Two senior Hamas members were killed “a few days ago” in an Israeli attack in Gaza, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed in a statement Thursday.Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who IDF says is a senior operative from Hamas’ military intelligence unit, along with another senior member Ahmed Aiush were killed in an attack at Hamas’ central intelligence command center, the military said.CNN is reaching out to Hamas about the Israeli military claim.The IDF didn’t specify the location in Gaza where the two Hamas members were killed.Israel believes it is having some success removing senior Hamas military operatives, which a senior IDF official discussed with journalists about two weeks ago.The official said that Israel assessed Hamas’s military wing was made up of 24 battalions — 10 of which had been “hurt significantly” by Israeli strikes since October 7.Some battalions in the north of the Gaza Strip had lost more than four of their commanders, the official said, representing a loss to those battalions of more than half their senior command.Among other things, this made it harder for Hamas’ military leadership to issue orders for counterattacks, the official said, because there was increasingly no one available to direct operations.Replacing commanders in the middle of a war was not possible, the official added.CNN’s Andrew Carey contributed reporting to this post.The Lebanon National News Agency (NNA) alleged Thursday that Israeli artillery shelled the outskirts of the town of Rmeish, in southern Lebanon, with “phosphorus.”The town is in the far south, close to the Israeli border.Video obtained by CNN shows columns of white smoke above the outskirts of the hilltop town. CNN is unable to confirm the use of phosphorous munitions.CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment.What is white phosphorus? It’s an incendiary weapon used to set fire to military targets. Its use is restricted under international humanitarian law; it can’t be fired at or near civilian areas or civilian infrastructure.Some context: Last month, the IDF responded to accusations about the use of white phosphorus in Lebanon, dismissing reports that the substance had been used for setting fires but acknowledging that it does use it in some circumstances.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Thursday morning with Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, commending the Israeli security cabinet for agreeing to allow more fuel into Gaza but saying that more needs to be done to get humanitarian assistance into the war-torn strip, according to a senior State Department official.Blinken also told Dermer that the Israeli government must do more to protect civilians, the official said.Israel’s security cabinet on Wednesday approved a “minimal” increase in the amount of fuel entering Gaza.In an interview on CNN’s “King Charles” on Wednesday, Blinken said that Israeli is taking some “important steps” to better protect civilians, but more action is required.Gal Meir Eisenkot, son of Israeli government minister Gadi Eisenkot, has been killed in northern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces announced on Thursday.“Master sergeant (Res.) Gal Meir Eisenkot, 25 from Herlizya, combat soldier in the 699th Battalion of the 551st reserve commando Brigade, died in battle in the northern Gaza Strip,” the IDF said in a statement.His father was chief of the General Staff of the IDF from February 2015 to January 2019 and served in the military for four decades.In the wake of the October 7 attacks, he joined the wartime cabinet as a minister without portfolio. He is a member of Benny Gantz’s National Unity Party, and was elected to Knesset in 2022.A total of 88 IDF soldiers have been killed in Gaza since October 7.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences in a post on X, formerly Twitter.“The government of Israel and the citizens of Israel mourn together with you. Our heroes did not fall in vain. We will continue to fight until victory,” Netanyahu said.Israel war cabinet member and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz also paid his tribute, saying in a statement: “May the memory of Gal and the memory of all those who fell in the battle for the home of all of us be blessed. Also in his name, also in their name, we continue the mission.”Correction: This post has been updated to reflect Gal Meir Eisenkot’s rank is master sergeant, not first sergeant. It also was updated to reflect that his father served as chief of the General Staff of the IDF until January 2019.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited northern Israel on Thursday, where he gave a blunt warning to Hezbollah.His warning comes after an Israeli man was killed by an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon on Thursday, according to Israeli first responders MDA. The Israeli military said an anti-tank missile was fired from Lebanese territory toward the area of Mattat in northern Israel.Israel and Hezbollah — an Iran-backed armed group that dominates southern Lebanon — have been engaged in daily cross-border exchanges of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border after the start of the conflict between Israel and Hamas on October 7, raising fears that the fighting could escalate into a regional war.Israel has received 200 cargo planes of military equipment from several countries, according to Israeli Ministry of Defense.This comes as use of US weapons come under scrutiny.The planes carried military equipment, including ammunition, armored vehicles and weapons, according to the Israeli Ministry of Defense, as the use of US weapons in the ongoing war in Gaza comes under increased scrutiny.The US State Department and the Defense Department both said they are reviewing Amnesty International’s report.The Israeli ministry said more than 10,000 tons of military equipment have been delivered since the start of the war on October 7. Pictures released by the Israeli Ministry of Defense show two different types of armored vehicles, as well as pallets of supplies.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense said the aid had come from several countries, but declined to say what other countries had sent aid or how much of it had come from the United States. The shipments of US military aid began soon after the war began.On Wednesday, December 6, for the first time, the number of corpses arriving at Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza surpassed the number of injured, Doctors Without Borders reported.The Al-Aqsa hospital is supported by Doctors Without Borders, according to the organization, which is also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).MSF reported 115 people killed in 24 hours.“The hospital is full, the morgue is full,” it said on X, the social media platform formerly called Twitter.The Israel Defense Forces has released a photo of a group of senior Hamas officials it claims to have killed in its military operation in Gaza.The photo shows 11 men from the Northern Gaza Brigade — the second largest unit in Hamas, according to the IDF, seated around a table, five of which have been circled in red and labeled as “eliminated.”The men indicated to have been killed are:In a statement, the IDF said the fighters were killed in an attack on a Hamas tunnel where they were “hiding under civilian homes and close to the Indonesian hospital.”According to the IDF, Al-Ghandour was “head of the military formation and responsible for the observations in the north of the Gaza Strip.”The brigade was hard hit in the attack, according to the IDF, and its functioning has been significantly compromised due to damage to its command center and infrastructure in the tunnels below Gaza.The IDF also claims to have killed four battalion commanders in the Gaza Brigade who are not pictured, destroying its battalion headquarters and infrastructure as well as taking control of central Gaza strongholds.CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment.The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said that work has stopped at its ambulance center in the northern Gaza governorate, because there is no fuel for vehicles and hospitals are out of service.In a statement issued Thursday, the PRCS said that minor and moderate injuries were being handled at a medical point set up by the PRCS’ ambulance team in the area.It said that the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza faced “very great challenges” in treating the wounded, again accusing the Israel military of targeting the hospital.Work in all hospitals in Gaza City, especially Al-Quds and Al-Shifa hospitals, had stopped because the Israeli military prevented crews from providing services, and many workers had been forced to flee to the south, “creating hundreds of victims due to the impossibility of providing emergency and medical service to the injured.”The Israel Defense Forces has persistently denied targeting hospitals as such, but accuses Hamas of operating from within and under hospitals. Israel says it will strike Hamas wherever it sees the militant group.On Wednesday, the PRCS said it was stopping its ambulance operations in northern Gaza.In southern Gaza, the PRCS said the fuel crisis continued at the Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis governorate, “where the consumption of services provided has been reduced to minimum.”Recovery efforts: The PRCS also said that bodies continue to be retrieved from the streets and from under rubble but operations to recover the dead were difficult because of the lack of fuel.It estimated the number of those unaccounted for — either under the rubble or lying in the streets — at 7,500, of which more than 4,700 are children and women.The PRCS said that 286 medical staff had been killed in Gaza since October 7 and 56 ambulances destroyed.CNN is unable to verify the society’s figures, but ambulances have been unable to operate in parts of northern Gaza because of air strikes and impassable roads. Anecdotal evidence suggests many bodies have not been recovered from destroyed buildings.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron has told CNN that Israel should “behave differently” in the south of Gaza than it has in the north, as its military campaign in the embattled enclave spreads.Cameron, a former British Prime Minister, reiterated British support for Israel in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attacks, but urged the country to abide by international law in its response.“We have to give Israel that basic support of saying, ‘You are right to try to get rid of Hamas’ leadership and its armed personnel’,” Cameron told CNN during a trip to Washington, D.C.He resisted calls for an immediate ceasefire, saying: “If we leave Hamas in charge of even a part of Gaza, there will never be a two-state solution because you can’t expect Israel to live next to a group of people that want to do October 7 all over again.”But Cameron supported remarks by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who told CNN on Wednesday that Israel is taking some “important steps” to better protect civilians during its offensive in southern Gaza.A humanitarian crisis has unfolded in Gaza, where Israeli air and ground assaults have left Palestinians displaced and in dire need of food, supplies and medical care.Cameron said that Blinken, whom he will meet on Thursday, made “a series of points about how Israel is trying to behave differently in the south of Gaza to the north of Gaza, and I think that is right, and we should continue to make those points to them.”“Ultimately the long-term security of Israel does depend not only on their own armed strength and fortitude, but also on having Palestinians able to live in peace and security as well,” Cameron said.More than 16,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since October 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah, which compiles its reports with data from hospitals in Hamas-run Gaza.In northern Gaza, 97% of households have inadequate food consumption and approximately 83% in southern Gaza are “adopting extreme consumption strategies” to survive as the Israel-Hamas war has caused “unimaginable loss, destruction and misery” in the strip, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said Thursday“Everyone in Gaza is hungry,” WFP chief Cindy McCain warned on social media platform X, formerly called Twitter. She also reiterated support for the UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire.In a report, the WFP said 9 out of 10 people in northern Gaza are going a full day and night without food consistently. CNN has reported on starving residents in Gaza digging for food, supplies under the rubble.The report also made the following assessment:The WFP said it was able to conduct a rapid food security assessment using a remote survey during the truce which ended on December 1. After this period, the situation has deteriorated further.The US is considering beefing up protections for commercial ships around a vital Red Sea shipping route amid a series of recent missile attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militants operating out of Yemen, according to military officials.The US has discussed ways to increase security in the area with members of the Combined Maritime Forces, a multi-national naval task force charged with protecting commercial shipping in the Red Sea. US officials have said publicly that discussions have centered on the possibility of escorting ships operating in the Red Sea and through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait into the Gulf of Aden — the narrow channel that separates Yemen and the Horn of Africa.Seven members of the task force — made up of 39 nations that rotate command — have already offered to help, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told an audience at the Atlantic Council in Washington on Monday. US officials have declined to say which nations have stepped forward.The discussions about bolstering the task force reflect growing concern in the region over the Iran-backed Houthis’ interference with the vital channel, through which millions of barrels of oil passes daily.The Houthi rebels, who are funded and trained by Iran, have repeatedly attacked commercial ships with drones and missiles in recent weeks, and in November seized an Israeli-linked cargo ship, taking its crew hostage. They have also launched missiles toward Israel, one of which was intercepted by a US Navy destroyer in October.Sanctions: The US Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on 13 individuals and entities with ties to a network providing tens of millions of dollars to the Houthis.Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement that “the Houthis continue to receive funding and support from Iran, and the result is unsurprising: unprovoked attacks on civilian infrastructure and commercial shipping, disrupting maritime security and threatening international commercial trade.”“Treasury will continue to disrupt the financial facilitation and procurement networks that enable these destabilizing activities,” he said.CNN’s Haley Britzky and Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting to this post.Clashes and Israeli strikes are continuing in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, according to reports on Thursday. Meanwhile, video geolocated by CNN shows heavy gunfire at the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza.It comes as the Rafah border crossing is set to open today for dozens of foreign nationals and dual citizens to exit the war-torn Strip, according to Egyptian authorities.Here are some of the other developments:This post has been updated with new reporting on the death toll in Gaza.Several students were wounded after an Israeli airstrike hit the town of Kounine in south Lebanon, the Lebanese national news agency (NNA) reported Thursday. NNA said students at the Kounine Institute were injured by shattered glass.Kounine sits several kilometres away from the country’s border with Israel.Video obtained by CNN shows the aftermath of the strike, with thick black smoke billowing above the town, with people running to safety on the streets.CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the incident.Hezbollah also said they targeted the Israeli kibbutz of Ma’yan Baruch on Thursday morning, which sits close to the border with Lebanon, to “support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in support of their brave and honorable resistance.”Hezbollah also claimed on Thursday to target another town that borders south Lebanon.Protesters in the United Kingdom have blocked entrances at four weapon factories that provide Israel with weapons and supplies, activist group Workers for a Free Palestine said on social media Thursday.Dozens of demonstrators with Palestinian flags are staging the blockades at the BAE Systems factory in Glasgow, the L3Harris factory in Brighton and at sites in Bournemouth and Lancashire.They are also calling for the British government to back a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.The UK is a key supplier for Israel’s military, providing 15% of the components for Israel’s F-35 fighter jets, according to a reported published by UK-based organization Campaign Against Arm Trade (CAAT) on October 17.The total value of these contracts is estimated to be $422 million (£336 million) since 2016, according to CAAT.Video geolocated by CNN shows heavy gunfire at the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza on Thursday.The footage shows civilians running in the street as the gunfire echoes through the area.Other video also geolocated by CNN shows damage to the nearby Al-Yemeni Saeed hospital, where the walls appear to have been impacted by shelling. It’s unclear when the damage was sustained.Accurate information about the strikes and clashes in Gaza, as well as about casualties and the state of hospitals, is difficult to obtain because of sporadic communications.However, a journalist in northern Gaza, Khader Al Za’anoun, told CNN that Israeli airstrikes had destroyed the Othman bin Qushqar mosque in the Zaytoun neighborhood of Gaza City. There were also injuries in nearby houses, Za’anoun said.He added that the Israeli army was deploying tanks in Palestine Square in Gaza City.Al-Za’anoun said there had been heavy casualties in several neighborhoods on northern Gaza, including in Shuja’iya, Zaytoun and Al-Daraj, and it was difficult for ambulances to reach the affected areas because of the gunfire.CNN is reaching out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on ongoing operations and deployments in northern Gaza and the claims that the Othman bin Qushqar Mosque has been destroyed.Elsewhere, there are reports of clashes and Israeli strikes continuing in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, where the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that the military had encircled the house of the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.The IDF posted video Thursday of troops moving through buildings geolocated by CNN as in the north of Khan Younis.At least 94 people have died and 406 been injured in Lebanon as a result of “the Israeli aggression against southern Lebanon” between October 8 – when Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel – and December 5, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.In a report released on Wednesday, the ministry added that 92% of wounded people are males and 96% of wounded people are Lebanese,The Israeli military has regularly exchanged fire with militants in southern Lebanon over the past two months, saying when it is fired upon, it will return fire.The Lebanon Disaster Risk Management Unit as of Wednesday had registered 20,000 displaced people from villages in Tyre district, south Lebanon, Lebanon state-run NNA news said on Thursday.Those displaced people are distributed among five shelter centers in the city of Tyre, not including thousands who were displaced to other areas and were not registered within the Disaster Risk Management Unit, NNA added.The unit said that there is a lack of resources to provide services, saying nearly 40 villages on the border with Israel are still not safe for civilians to return.Israel has also evacuated communities on its side of the border in response to rockets fired from Lebanese territory.Eight Thai nationals are now believed to be held hostage by Hamas, according to Thailand’s foreign affairs ministry.That figure is one less than previously reported after it was discovered that one person was safely in Israel the whole time.Twenty-three Thai nationals held hostage in Gaza were released by Hamas under a deal brokered with Israel with the help of foreign mediation. The agreement saw a pause in fighting and the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza will open Thursday for dozens of foreign nationals and dual citizens to exit the war-torn strip, according to Egyptian authorities.A list published by the Egyptian Authority for Crossings and Borders includes 63 US citizens alongside nationals of Romania, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.It also includes 13 United Nations personnel intending to enter Gaza.Rafah is the only border crossing in Gaza not controlled by Israel. It has been a vital lifeline for aid to enter the enclave and for people to escape the fighting since Israel’s war with Hamas began in October.UK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps will visit Israel and the occupied West Bank this week in a push for humanitarian aid to be delivered quicker to war-torn Gaza, the British government said Thursday.In a news release, the government said Shapps will discuss delivering aid by sea directly to the strip during upcoming talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.Four Royal Air Force flights carrying more than 74 metric tons of aid for Palestinians have landed in Egypt, the release added.Shapps is also expected to discuss progress on recovering hostages, including several Britons who were taken by Hamas in the October 7 attack.Two Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday amid Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza, the Israeli military said.One of the men was killed in battle in central Gaza, while the other died a day after he was wounded in southern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.Four other Israeli soldiers were seriously injured in Gaza on Wednesday, the IDF said.Dozens of Israeli troops have been killed since Israel expanded its ground operations in the Palestinian enclave in October. More than 16,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in the strip since October 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.Multiple United Nations agencies are warning of the dire situation for residents of war-torn Gaza as Israel approved a “minimal” increase in the amount of fuel permitted to enter the strip to prevent a “humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics” in the south.In separate statements Wednesday, the World Health Organization chief said Gaza’s health system is “on its knees” and nearing total collapse, while the head of the World Food Programme said the humanitarian system in the strip is collapsing and, “Everyone in #Gaza is hungry.”Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it is advancing in the south of the enclave, where it says it has surrounded the home of Hamas’ leader in Gaza in what a senior adviser to Israel’s prime minister told CNN was a “symbolic victory.”Here’s what else you need to know:Gaza’s health system is “on its knees” and nearing total collapse, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement on Wednesday.On Tuesday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah accused the Israeli military of placing the Kamal Adwan hospital under siege.CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for a response. In previous statements, Israel had maintained it targets Hamas infrastructure in the strip.WHO has reported at least 212 attacks on Gaza’s health sector since October 7. As a result, only 14 hospitals are partially functioning and three are minimally functioning in the strip, while 19 have gone out of service, the WHO chief added.Palestinian Minister of Health Mai Al-Kaila said Tuesday that none of the hospitals in northern Gaza can accommodate surgical operations, while the capacity has surpassed 216% in hospitals in the south.CNN’s Kareem Khadder contributed reporting to this post.An investigation by Amnesty International alleges that a US-made weapons guidance system was used in two Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in October in which 43 civilians are said to have been killed.Fragments of the US-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions guidance system were found in the rubble of destroyed homes in the neighborhood of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to a report released Tuesday by the human rights organization.Israel uses a wide variety of American weapons and munitions, but Amnesty’s report is one of the first attempts to tie an American-made weapon to a specific attack that left a significant number of civilians dead.The JDAM is a “guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into accurate, adverse weather ‘smart’ munitions,” according to the US Air Force.CNN cannot independently verify Amnesty’s findings.Amnesty said its weapons experts and a “remote sensing analyst” examined satellite imagery and photos of the homes that show the “fragments of ordnance recovered from the rubble” and the destruction, the report explains. Amnesty’s fieldworkers took the photos.As a result of these two attacks, 19 children, 14 women, and 10 men were killed, the report claims.The human rights organization said it “did not find any indication there were any military objectives at the sites” of the airstrikes or that the individuals living in the homes were legitimate military targets.In a statement to CNN, the Israel Defense Forces called the report “flawed, biased and premature, based on baseless assumptions regarding the IDF’s operations.”Read more about the Amnesty report.World Food Programme (WFP) Chief Cindy McCain is warning of the limited access to food and water in the Gaza strip.WFP said 97% of Palestinian households in the northern areas of the strip and 83% in the south reported inadequate food consumption — with many having spent at least one day without eating.The lack of cooking gas in Gaza has also led many to rely on waste burning, firewood and wood rubbish, which can have negative health repercussions, including high risks of respiratory diseases, according to WFP’s data.Additionally, the average daily clean water consumption levels range between 1.5-1.8 liters per person across the strip, which is way below the 15 liters minimum average volume of water for drinking and hygiene per person daily.The number of civilian casualties in Gaza is too high, US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Wednesday.Speaking several days into the renewed offensive by Israeli forces in southern Gaza, Miller said the United States wants “to see the civilian death toll lower than it has been.”Miller noted the conflict in southern Gaza was “still at an early stage,” and would not say whether the US believes Israeli forces are carrying out this part of their offensive differently than in the north.Miller said the State Department had “some very frank conversations with the government of Israel about that when we were there last week,” during US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit.“We continue to have very frank discussions with them about this question, and I think I’ll leave it at that,” he said.Blinken said last week that Israel must prosecute the war differently in the south than it did in the north.Israeli forces have breached Hamas “defense lines” in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where they have been involved in a fierce battle with the militant group since Tuesday, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said Wednesday.It comes after the IDF said the Israeli military had begun carrying out raids against “Hamas strongholds” in the center of Khan Younis, the territory’s second-largest city.Within a few hours after Israeli troops surrounded the city, “the soldiers pierced through the defensive lines of the Khan Younis Brigade, encircling it and for the first time began to operate in the heart of the area,” the military said.The Khan Younis Brigade is one of Hamas’ two most significant battalions, according to the Israeli military.Hamas leader “underground”: Earlier Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces had encircled the house of Hamas’ leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. The IDF would not say where it believes Sinwar is, but that he was “underground.” Sinwar is originally from Khan Younis but it is unclear if he is currently there.Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is “underground” in Gaza, the Israeli military said Wednesday, but did not say where they believe he is.The statement from an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson came shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the IDF had surrounded Sinwar’s house in southern Gaza.“Our role is to reach Sinwar and kill him. We need to do that as soon as possible,” he added.A senior adviser to Netanyahu on Wednesday told CNN the encirclement of Sinwar’s house is a “symbolic victory.”“It will be a real victory very soon,” Mark Regev said. “It’s only a matter of time before we get the man.”A partisan clash between Senate Republicans and Democrats over border policy continues to threaten the effort to send badly needed foreign aid to key US allies as time and money are running out for Ukraine.Senate negotiators are vowing to continue to try to reach a deal, after Republicans blocked foreign aid from advancing Wednesday evening in protest over the package’s lack of changes to border and immigration policy.The impasse among negotiators has taken on a renewed sense of urgency as the 2023 congressional calendar is drawing to a close.The Senate has struggled for weeks as it tied immigration and border security policy — one of Congress’ historically most divisive issues — to a legislative package for sending aid to key US allies, among them Israel and Ukraine.Read the full

CNN,Feud between Haley and Ramaswamy grows more heated in 4th debate,2023-12-06 23:29:00,Aaron Pellish,"Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy clashed throughout Wednesday’s fourth Republican primary debate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, reigniting one of the most contentious feuds of the primary cycle thus far, which was punctuated by Ramaswamy’s accusation that Haley was “corrupt.”Ramaswamy attacked Haley in the opening minutes of the debate, criticizing her for accepting donations from wealthy donors, including some who have supported President Joe Biden, and for her support of the US providing aid to Ukraine.Haley responded to attacks of her growing support from wealthy donors by dismissing Ramaswamy as “just jealous” and said she doesn’t change her positions to appease donors.Haley and Ramaswamy have traded barbs at each of the previous three debates, with each exchange heightening the tension between the two. The source of their disagreements typically focuses on foreign policy issues, but as the two continue to clash, their attacks have become increasingly personal. The substance and tone of those moments at Wednesday’s debate appeared to build on the history of confrontation between them, as both candidates leaned into personal attacks.Ramaswamy reiterated his attacks on Haley’s ties to donors throughout the debate, culminating in him holding up a handwritten sign on his notepad that read “Nikki = Corrupt” as he defended himself from claims that his attacks against her were sexist.“After the third debate, when I criticized Ronna McDaniel after five failed years of leadership of this party and criticized Nikki for her corrupt foreign dealings as a military contractor, she said that I have a woman problem. Nikki, I don’t have a woman problem. You have a corruption problem. And I think that that’s what people need to know. Nikki is corrupt,” he said, emphasizing his argument by holding up the sign, which he had written in large font on his notepad, for the audience to see.When asked if she would like to respond to Ramaswamy’s blunt attack, Haley dismissively declined.“No, it’s not worth my time to respond to him,” she said.At the first debate in Milwaukee, Haley joined several candidates on the stage, including former Vice President Mike Pence and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, in criticizing Ramaswamy’s positions on the war in Ukraine, the US relationship with Israel, and China.“The problem that Vivek doesn’t understand is, he wants to hand Ukraine to Russia, he wants to let China eat Taiwan, he wants to go and stop funding Israel. You don’t do that to friends,” Haley said.Haley added that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a “murderer” and that Ramaswamy is “choosing a murderer over a proud American country.”Ramaswamy hit back at Haley by suggesting she’s supporting America’s role in global conflicts to benefit corporations that supply weapons for the US military.“Nikki, I wish you well on your future career on the boards of Lockheed and Raytheon,” he said.Haley then cut off Ramaswamy, reiterating her belief that his positions will harm America’s interests.“He will make America less safe. Under your watch, you will make America less safe,” Haley said. “You have no foreign policy experience and it shows.”The two continued their disagreement on foreign policy during the third debate in Miami, where Ramaswamy sought to differentiate himself from the former UN ambassador’s foreign policy experience. He portrayed her as overeager to engage the US in foreign conflict and suggested she personally profited from US military contracts during her time on the board of Boeing.Ramaswamy compared Haley to former Vice President Dick Cheney, viewed by some as the driving force behind the US entering into wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during the George W. Bush administration.“Do you want a leader from a different generation who is going to put this country first, or do you want Dick Cheney in three-inch heels?” Ramaswamy asked the audience.Haley, the only woman on the stage, responded to the quip about her shoes directly before defending her support for Israel’s military operations against Hamas.“I’d first like to say they’re five-inch heels and I don’t wear them unless you can run them,” Haley said. “I wear heels, they’re not for a fashion statement. They’re for ammunition.”During Wednesday night’s debate, Ramaswamy again sought to discredit Haley’s foreign policy experience, which he said is “not the same as foreign policy wisdom,” and challenged Haley on the debate stage to name three provinces in eastern Ukraine.“Reject this myth that they’ve been selling you that somebody had a cup of coffee stint at the UN and then makes 8 million bucks after has real foreign policy experience. It takes an outsider to see this through,” Ramaswamy said.“Look at the blank expression,” he continued, gesturing to Haley as members of the audience booed Ramaswamy. “She doesn’t know the names of the provinces she wants to fight for.”Later in the debate, Haley did name multiple provinces being fought over in eastern Ukraine.During the second debate in Simi Valley, California, Haley attacked Ramaswamy for having recently joined TikTok, the social media app owned by the Chinese-based company ByteDance. As Ramaswamy sought to defend his decision to join the app in hopes of reaching younger voters, Haley bluntly panned his reasoning.“Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber,” she said.Haley continued to attack Ramaswamy for his business dealings in China and called for a total ban on the social media app.“We can’t trust you. We can’t trust you,” she said. “We can’t have TikTok in our kids’ lives. We need to ban it.”The entanglement set the stage for another clash during the third debate in Miami after Ramaswamy evoked Haley’s daughter’s use of TikTok as part of his defense for his own use of the app.“In the last debate, she made fun of me for actually joining TikTok while her own daughter was actually using the app for a long time. So you might want to take care of your family first,” Ramaswamy said.Haley interjected, telling him to “leave my daughter out of your voice.”“You’re just scum,” Haley muttered into the microphone as Ramaswamy continued his response, rolling her eyes.",6201,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/politics/haley-ramaswamy-feud/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/untitled-1-20231207035456720.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country funding leadership clashed respond enter response alabama change afghanistan culminate simi back minute continue corporation russia argument lockheed profit russian tension daughter sought weapon relationship american stop suggest drive long app heighten continued interject ban gesture large accusation tiktok mutter microphone audience corruption pan moment compare appease personally mike view leave primary china vivek company wish booed put taiwan write lean multiple fun trust america gov harm reignite reach contentious dick outsider wednesday medium total province defend global emphasize biden fashion dealing increasingly cup benefit career california military eastern miami role overeager experience eat history donation stage board challenged build supply set operation heel million sign george republican proud carolina bit young candidate font entanglement dismissively fight former life vladimir year claim understand cheney portrayed member typically wealthy handwritten shoe leader vice differentiate tuscaloosa social scum bluntly dumber defense notepad wisdom fought attack blunt mcdaniel party force make hear voter cycle fail hand aid exchange policy foreign sell eye haley quip donor jersey opening contract tie family expression entrepreneur safe penny israel recently support friend previous chris directly president choose wear valley christie add roll different part criticize reiterate debate myth contractor nikki fourth bytedance feud personal trade join barb worth decision evoke murderer feel iraq stint confrontation focus position future belief include grow run punctuate disagreement engage jealous real night raytheon clash woman hold time cut corrupt putin joe statement issue blank hit bush ronna generation provide problem discredit watch tone coffee accept hope source conflict ukraine ramaswamy milwaukee south business ambassador substance read kid reject buck dismiss call,-0.9353,0.14513788098693758,8.91953795379538,0.2964755978148835,0
CNN,Australia signs major security deal with Papua New Guinea,2023-12-06 23:07:00,Angus Watson,"Australia and Papua New Guinea have signed a major security agreement that will place Australian police in the Pacific nation.Speaking to reporters alongside Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape in Canberra on Thursday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese characterized the deal as a “significant and historic” agreement between two countries with already close relations.“It will make it easier for Australia to help PNG address its internal security needs and for Australia and Papua New Guinea to support each other’s security and the region’s stability,” Albanese said.The new deal cements Australia’s role in Papua New Guinea’s policing, judiciary and defense. Australia has pledged 200 million Australian dollars ($130 million) to support the initiatives, including a training center for police recruits.While the deal does not preclude Papua New Guinea from signing pacts with other nations, both countries agreed to consult with one another on security threats.Marape said Papua New Guinea’s judiciary, public service and borders were established by Australia before the country became an independent nation 48 years ago.“You have always given support to us. What happens up north of your borders has deep, deep shared effect, benefit, consequences, on our region,” Marape said.He told reporters the agreement with Australia showed they were “brother and sister nations,” but added his country would not pick sides as it had a foreign policy of “friends to all.”The deal comes in the wake of a US security agreement with Papua New Guinea signed in May which included upgrades to local military bases.In 2022 China and the Solomon Islands shocked the US and its allies by announcing a bilateral security pact, affirmed in Beijing in July. The deal between Honiara and Beijing stoked fears of the possibility of a Chinese military base in the western Pacific and prompted a diplomatic push by Australia in the Pacific.Asked about China at the Canberra press conference, Marape said Papua New Guinea’s relationships with the US and Australia don’t come at the “expense of our relationships elsewhere.”",2121,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/australia/australia-papua-new-guinea-security-deal-intl-hnk/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210615140022-angus-watson.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",Politics,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police country historic dollar share australia defense public make relationship side ally major internal july foreign policy close independent service australian fear diplomatic western cement consult china support friend papua address brother effect stoke add deal minister easy preclude told base sister conference push consequence place affirm albanese possibility marape reporter local honiara prime canberra judiciary guinea benefit include pacific establish bilateral png expense island military nation alongside role signing region give characterize initiative significant james million announce north sign thursday chinese wake agree deep border solomon center show beijing agreement pick press training year shock anthony pact stability prompt security pledge upgrade,0.9598,0.2828854314002829,11.793439153439149,0.30427663734115346,0
CNN,Aluminum tower construction in Tahiti for Olympic surf event paused after barge damages coral,2023-12-07 08:08:00,Amy Woodyatt,"The International Surf Association says it welcomes the pause of an aluminum tower’s construction ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic surfing competition in Tahiti, French Polynesia, as surfers voice their concern about the environmental impact of preparations for next year’s event.Teahupo’o, Tahiti, some 9,759 miles away from Paris, is regarded as one of the world’s best surf spots, and is home to World Surf League (WSL) tour competitions, where a wooden structure is usually erected for competitions and later removed.However, Olympic organizers’ plans to build the aluminum tower to host 40 people to judge and televise the competition have been met with opposition from locals and pro surfers.In November, Olympic organizers said they had adjusted the tower’s original design of to make it “more moderate.” Originally meant to weight 14 tons, the tower will now be nine tons, though foundations still need to be drilled.A petition by residents and visitors of Teahupoo calling for the government to rethink the tower, as well as the drilling of the platform and the underwater pipelines for the surfing competition has received over 181,000 signatures.However, controversy over the structure continues to bubble: video posted Saturday by Save Teahupo’o Reef showed a barge – being used to build the tower – stuck on the reef, as well as evidence of broken coral.“The ISA was saddened and surprised to see that a test undertaken by the French Polynesian government resulted in the coral reef at Teahupo’o being damaged by a barge,” the ISA said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the French Polynesian government has taken the decision to pause all further testing and preparations to draw lessons following the incident on the reef.“The ISA welcomes this decision, and has urged intensified consultations to consider all available options.”Surfer Kanoa Igarashi was one of the surfers to speak out on the construction of the aluminum tower, posting to Instagram: “After seeing yesterday’s video, I’ve realized how much damage this ‘new tower’ is causing.”“I trusted that they would consider the local environment more. But I guess I was wrong … All for a two-day event and not much future benefits for the local community,” said Igarashi on Sunday, and later reshared.“The Olympics is meant to leave the community a better place than before the games but this action is not showing that in my opinion. I hope we can all find a solution,” he added.Meanwhile, 11-time world champion Kelly Slater, has also criticized the revised plans for the platform, reportedly commenting that it “doesn’t make any sense to need such a giant tower for a 2 days event.”In a statement sent to CNN, the World Surf League said it was “concerned by the damage to the reef at Teahupo’o that seems to have occurred due to the ongoing work to construct a new tower for the 2024 Olympics.”“We continue to believe it is important for organizers to engage with and listen to the local community as they contemplate their decisions related to the Olympic competition at this iconic wave,” added the World Surf League statement.Campaigners and local residents have long been raising concerns about the impact of the new structure on the environment.Astrid Drollet, secretary of the Vai Ara O Teahupo’o association, which is behind the petition Save Teahupo’o Reef, told CNN that the existing wooden tower “has been in use for 20 years and is very well maintained.”“So we don’t understand why Paris 2024 and French Polynesia are not using this tower for the four days of competition,” adding that the new tower “is going to cause major damage to the environment.”Alexandra Dempsey, coral reef ecologist and CEO of Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation, said that the coral formation that makes Tahiti such an ideal place for professional surfing could be damaged by the tower.“The local communities there are incredibly passionate and culturally tied to the ocean, and particularly the reef systems and the reef systems there that caused the wave action in that area. And the perfect wave … is … a natural effect of how the reef is and has been naturally formed for millions of years,” she told CNN Sport.“You’re really not only damaging the ecology of the reef, but also the structure that’s been there, that’s been able to create the wonderful waves that that site was chosen for. And we’re not really sure what the outcomes or the fallout would be of damaging the reef system there,” she added.There are over 1,000 species of fish and 150 species of coral in French Polynesia, according to Tahiti’s tourism board. Threatened by the effects of climate change and mass tourism, the corals are a highly protected species.“The French Polynesian Government and Paris 2024 are working on solutions that will enable the new tower to be set up which has been reduced in size and weight,” said a statement from Paris 2024 sent to CNN.“This was the result of collective effort between Paris 2024 and French Polynesian government to reduce the impact of the tower on the natural environment.“Technical meetings organised with all those involved in the project, and guided by the project manager on site, should enable solutions to be found rapidly.“With less than a year to go before the surfing events are due to be held in Teahupo’o, those involved in the project are reaffirming more than ever their desire to work with the associations in a transparent manner to ensure that the Paris 2024 Games are a success for French Polynesia.”",5513,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/sport/olympic-tahiti-surf-environmental-damage-intl-spt/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231206120026-02-tahiti-2024-olympics.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_833,w_1480,c_fill",Sports,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,chosen climate visitor raise ecologist available broken november change ocean sultan opinion ongoing manner continue reaffirm preparation outcome urge khaled incredibly mass revise sunday ahead polynesian intensified major organizer long natural spot kelly competition ceo reduce draw ideal project professional tower leave effort system effect regard receive wrong stuck day damage meant told particularly wooden cnn weight yesterday trust undertaken drollet game saturday wednesday surf teahupoo polynesia realize consider local evidence accord structure due benefit platform controversy event slater alexandra originally video tour listen fish tahiti construction board reportedly living meeting build passionate set guide secretary home million action form international specie design site olympic test ara concerned exist original opposition year drilling resident understand pipeline post isa away follow paris related reef held result found teahupo pause surfer threaten organise foundation judge make formation tourism instagram desire coral iconic concern enable lesson tie plan wonderful success believe work ecology collective giant contemplate surprised olympics add fallout environment comment erect criticize find wsl dempsey highly incident guess aluminum pro place host sadden wave adjust decision igarashi save manager occur televise speak future protect french champion league perfect petition welcome consultation barge transparent important engage impact government association world kanoa ensure solution naturally technical culturally involve rethink statement underwater voice bubble show create environmental construct hope mile community call size area,0.9924,0.05441683294032287,9.638070009460733,0.3625224466891134,0
CNN,The first Chinese warships have docked at a newly expanded Cambodian naval base. Should the US be worried?,2023-12-06 22:21:00,Nectar Gan,"Chinese warships have docked for the first time at Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base, which is undergoing a Chinese-funded upgrade that has drawn concerns from the United States over its potential role in expanding China’s overseas military footprint.Cambodia’s Defense Minister Tea Seiha visited the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy warships docked at the Ream port on Sunday along with his father – and predecessor – Tea Banh, according to a post on the official’s Facebook page.While the post did not specifically mention the Chinese military, the accompanying photos showed two PLA Navy corvettes docked side by side. On board one of the corvettes, identified as the “Wenshan” on the vessel’s gangplank, Tea Banh reviewed a row of Chinese naval officers.The ships are in preparation for training the Cambodian navy, according to the post.Other photos in the post show the father and son inspecting infrastructure construction on the site and viewing a design plan of the project.Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore, said according to public records, this is the first time PLA Navy ships have docked at the port, which before renovation was only fitted for the Cambodian Navy’s smaller patrol crafts.“It is a signal that Ream is about to be completed. Of course, it’s still work in progress for them, but at least now, it has expanded to the point that it could accommodate a foreign navy ship,” he said.John Bradford, executive director of the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, said it is no surprise that Chinese ships were the first to visit the upgraded base.“After all, the facilities were funded by the Chinese and China is a close partner to Cambodia,” he said.The visit of Chinese warships coincided with a top Chinese general’s trip to Phnom Penh, where he hailed China and Cambodia as “true ironclad friends.”He Weidong, a vice chairman of China’s top military body, the Central Military Commission, told Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet that the two countries’ militaries have sustained “high-level cooperation in fields including high-level exchange, mechanism building, joint drills and exercises, and personnel training,” according to a Chinese readout of the meeting.Hun, who succeeded his father Hun Sun earlier this summer, thanked the Chinese military for its “strong support for the modernization of the Cambodian army,” according to the statement posted on the Chinese Defense Ministry’s website.The Chinese general also held talks with Tea, the Cambodian Defense Minister, to exchange views on “bilateral relations, military cooperation, and international issues of common interest,” according to the readout, which did not mention the visiting PLA Navy warships.CNN has reached out to China’s Ministry of Defense for comment.A US State Department spokesperson said Washington was monitoring reports of the Chinese warships, according to Reuters. “While we have no comment on this specific development, we have serious concerns about the PRC’s plans for exclusive control over portions of Ream Naval Base,” the official told Reuters, referring to China by its official name, the People’s Republic of China.The unprecedented presence of Chinese navy ships at the Ream Naval Base, which occupies a strategic position near the southern tip of Cambodia close to the South China Sea, is likely to deepen long-standing concerns among US officials that China is seeking a military outpost in the Gulf of Thailand.Such concerns were already heightened in June last year, when Chinese and Cambodian officials presided together over a ground-breaking ceremony for a project to renovate the port with grant aid from China.Cambodian officials have repeatedly denied the facility would be used by China as a naval base, insisting the project is in line with Cambodia’s constitution, which bars foreign military bases on its territory. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have described the base as an “aid project” to strengthen Cambodia’s navy and called assertions otherwise “hype” with “ulterior motives.”For the US, the Chinese-funded expansion at Ream is particularly troubling as it involved the demolishing of a US-funded facility there — a development that served as something of an analogy for Cambodia’s closer ties with Beijing and growing distance from Washington, according to Bradford at the Yokosuka Council.For some, the visiting Chinese navy ships have raised new alarms.“The arrival of these Chinese warships at Ream exposes China’s long-concealed military aims, marking a major evolution in China’s regional defense posture. To continue dismissing China’s expanding military footprint is to indulge in self-delusion,” said Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.Singleton, who wrote an analysis on Beijing’s growing push for overseas port access earlier this year, said China’s presence at the Ream Naval Base is part of a broader plan to complicate America’s global military calculus.“By building closer military ties and economic dependencies with select countries along major maritime routes, Beijing can exert diplomatic pressure on them, limiting U.S. basing access and complicating coalition-building efforts to support Taiwan’s defense should China ever invade,” the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own, he said.Alongside Djibouti in East Africa, Beijing’s sole military base overseas, Ream “signals more than just a cost-effective extension of China’s defense perimeter, but a calculated, assertive repositioning with grave implications for Washington and its allies.”But other experts have noted that the level of access the PLA is granted at Ream could be very different from its base in Djibouti, where Chinese troops can be permanently stationed at onshore facilities. That arrangement would be a violation of Cambodia’s constitution, said Koh at the RSIS.“There are many other types of access arrangements that don’t amount to or fall short of a real base agreement,” Koh said, such as allocating certain piers solely for Chinese navy use or ensuring the PLA Navy can be accommodated when it visits.“I think there’s a lot of it being overblown that it’s a base for the Chinese. I don’t think that’s the case,” he said.Cambodia has also appeared to be open to allow other foreign delegations to visit Ream – seen as part of its effort to refute accusations it is granting the Chinese military exclusive access to the naval base. Last March, a Japanese navy delegation visited the base.“Until we could see going forward, whether the Cambodians only allow the Chinese navy to dock at the base, or they will allow other foreign navies to dock, we cannot come to a very easy conclusion that it is arranged only for exclusive Chinese access,” Koh said.But even if Ream will not be used to exclusively and permanently station Chinese forces, gaining regular access to it could have implications for military operations related to the South China Sea dispute between China and the Southeast Asian claimants.Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims.“Ream would provide PLAN forces with an additional axis for attack and resupply in the case of a South China Sea conflict. Furthermore, bases on the Asian mainland would possibly be more easily resupplied, more resilient, and more capable than those established on relatively remote reclaimed features,” said Bradford, the analyst.But he noted that the facilities in Cambodia would not be a “game-changer” in a South China Sea struggle.“The distance (from) Ream to the Spratly Islands is greater than the distance from the Spratly Islands to major PLA bases on Hainan island,” he said, referring to the southernmost Chinese province and the disputed archipelago in the South China Sea where Beijing has built military installations on manmade islands.Chinese forces operating from Cambodia would have to fly over Vietnam or detour south to pass between Vietnam’s southern tip and the northeast corner of Peninsular Malaysia, making this line of attack vulnerable to interdiction, Bradford said.But Ream also allows the Chinese navy to dock much closer to the southern South China Sea – an important factor in China’s growing operations in Indonesia’s Natuna Sea and Malaysia’s Economic Exclusion Zone, said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.“This new naval base exceeds Cambodia’s present requirements, but its significance is more geo-strategic than purely military. It signifies the Sino-Cambodian defense relationship and adds to Vietnam’s concerns about being encircled by China,” Schuster said.",8944,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/asia/cambodia-ream-naval-base-chinese-warships-us-analysis/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231026160351-nectar-gan-medium-shot.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100",International News,https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.W3gWO3a5Tnx3PvP_-LsgjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country spratly vulnerable raise army lot refer northeast renovate fly fall craig record short top succeed southernmost inspect complete archipelago insist continue rsis line preparation public strategic grave resilient requirement amount relationship side sunday expert schuster facility liberation major troop heighten banh dispute manet footprint close economic described accusation wenshan port rajaratnam type resupply body installation resupplied project zone gangplank strong brunei dock senior africa view built evolution effort china exceeds aim hail warship sandbar exclusion navy arrangement ship open upgraded corner relation mention taiwan review koh conclusion write told study chairman course particularly level undergo overblown america executive readout push solely school reach expand surprise tip tea province global present route mainland repeatedly department presence station mechanism partner deny accord prime capable drill ulterior pacific establish common outpost potential military reposition role small southern construction broader board drawn arrival commission purely operation possibly exercise talk reuters international bar site design unprecedented vietnam demolish facebook preside perimeter former onshore field year claim post pla cambodian regional specifically related held report spokesperson penh relatively official row thanked vice japanese interest accommodate visit central interdiction indisputable carl june case defense posture accompany trip operating photo invade attack foundation malaysia expose modernization force make factor sole naval corvette vessel aid analysis forward exchange foreign joint expansion hype distance concern command feature assertion patrol permanently tie peninsular docked plan access limit united exclusively diplomatic phnom cambodia deepen sun work calculate mark grant support fellow assertive pressure violation ceremony compete hundred add progress different minister part comment dependency axis easy occupies complicate research signal seiha overseas building strengthen sovereignty base infrastructure easily delegation yokosuka southeast significance state encircle serve allocate seek select remote identify cooperation hainan control sustain arrange ream regular note position earlier reclaim exert bilateral include grow fit director island fund specific republic general important refute council real exclusive point tank singleton father personnel indulge ensure constitution bradford signifies involve chinese time hold statement issue washington additional detour coincide ministry asian ironclad extension philippine analogy intelligence beijing provide show djibouti pier agreement indonesia renovation development training east summer implication closer gulf mile conflict march trouble south monitoring prc portion maritime natuna great weidong manmade territory call dismiss upgrade singapore predecessor,0.9855,0.20125223613595705,11.341992619926199,0.3584222087436375,0

""After that, I'm not a dictator.""Hannity said that it sounded like what Trump was saying was that he would go back to his first-term policies, to which the former president agreed.Trump's comments come after multiple media outlets claimed a second term for the former president would result in a ""dictatorship.""Biden's campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez blasted Trump over the comments, saying in a release, ""Donald Trump has been telling us exactly what he will do if he’s reelected and tonight he said he will be a dictator on day one.""""Americans should believe him,"" she said.Trump mocked President Biden for his claim that he wouldn't be running for re-election if Trump wasn't in the race.""Well, I think somebody gave him a talking point.

Who else would be able to do it, number one, who else would think about it?"" Trump asked, adding that he told farmers to ""buy more land"" and ""bigger tractors.""Trump's town hall began with him torching Biden over his criticism of his MAGA movement.""You know, I see Biden talking about, 'Oh, MAGA! MAGA!' MAGA means Make America Great Again. That's what it means. And that's what people want,"" Trump said to cheers from the crowd.""They want to see our country be great again.

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced Wednesday that he will resign from his congressional seat after being ousted as House speaker.McCarthy made the announcement in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal.""No matter the odds, or personal cost, we did the right thing. That may seem out of fashion in Washington these days, but delivering results for the American people is still celebrated across the country. It is in this spirit that I have decided to depart the House at the end of this year to serve America in new ways. I know my work is only getting started,"" McCarthy wrote. ""I will continue to recruit our country’s best and brightest to run for elected office. The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders.""McCarthy surmised, ""It often seems that the more Washington does, the worse America gets. I started my career as a small-business owner, and I look forward to helping entrepreneurs and risk-takers reach their full potential. The challenges we face are more likely to be solved by innovation than legislation.""KEVIN MCCARTHY, MATT GAETZ TRADE JABS AS FIERCE RIVALRY CONTINUES: HE 'BELONGS IN JAIL'Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is not running for re-election, he says. (Tom Brenner for The Washington Post via Getty Images)He detailed that ""the most reliable solution to what ails America is before our eyes: everyday men and women who are raising families, showing up for work, volunteering, and pursuing the American Dream with passion and purpose. I agree with President Reagan’s observation that 'all great change in America starts at the dinner table.'""""Despite the best attempts by special interest groups and the news media to divide us, I have seen the goodness of the American people. They are what will ultimately uphold the enduring values of our great nation. We all have a role to play in that effort,"" McCarthy wrote. ""I never could have imagined the journey when I first threw my hat into the ring. I go knowing I left it all on the field — as always, with a smile on my face. And looking back, I wouldn’t have had it any other way. Only in America.""McCarthy started the op-ed by writing, ""I’m an optimist. How could I not be?"" He went on to detail how he’s the son of a firefighter and served in the same congressional seat for the last 17 years, ironically from the same office in which he was previously denied an internship.McCarthy recalled how he helped Republicans to a House majority twice. ""We got more Republican women, veterans and minorities elected to Congress at one time than ever before,"" he wrote.

""We reduced the deficit by more than $2 trillion, revamped work requirements for adults on the sidelines, cut red tape for critical domestic energy projects, and protected the full faith and credit of the U.S. We kept our government operating and our troops paid while wars broke out around the world.""McCarthy was the first House speaker to be voted out of the position in U.S. history.With the departure of former Rep.

Though McCarthy maintained support from most Republicans in the House, eight GOP detractors ultimately ushered in his ouster in October, mainly taking issue with McCarthy for choosing to work with Democrats to temporarily delay a federal government shutdown.At the start of this year, Republicans held only a fragile margin in the chamber after a predicted ""red wave"" failed to materialize in the 2022 elections.McCarthy endured a dayslong floor fight in January that eventually resulted in his ascension to the House’s top job at a time when deep divisions within the GOP raised serious questions about the party’s ability to govern following former President Donald Trump leaving office.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",5692,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-announces-he-wont-run-re-election-being-ousted-speaker,https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/340/340/Danielle-Wallace-headshot.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cgyUI9sP8zj7Zhf5tpOI2wHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country leadership oust raise minority boot change top opinion trillion back uphold continue smile broke seat vacate owner resign critical celebrate requirement rare american troop app continued lose pursue reduce project passion detailed full leave effort hochul govern admission firefighter slim maintain matter start day reagan kevin write cost remain congressional legislative ouster america gov crime reach expand fox bill wednesday file medium inquiry tom journey global volunteer biden reporter deliver fashion deny rep temporarily career establish departure applewhite revamped energy california potential nation role experience depart october floor meeting deficit legislation set red brightest george republican congress talk play agree wall border imagine speaker meaning ring fight knew original former credit field year goodness speaks stun post follow brenner independence held result january innovation leader dream interest surmise despite motion endure impeachment charter majority odds operating party accomplishment make dayslong special solve spirit sideline fail forward table eye restore dinner division predict communist paid achieve adult family hour commit entrepreneur secure announcement work orchestrate support tape president choose month job date question gop group detractor kathy threw purpose fragile chamber journal rival lead persistent scott fact proposal value personal trump trade serve ushered delay street elect wave select ability image newsom challenge ail parent rivalry decide gavin piece position york vote recruit federal protect mccarthy lending afford run gaetz veteran previously government speakership loses left accountable world woman solution fierce recall optimist announce chinese time hold bipartisan cut cheerfully capitol reliable issue washington detail listing house office domestic generation deep news materialize intelligence obscure show getty donald margin ultimately ascension matt election faith closer eventually divide santos observation ironically attempt district great everyday pass democrat committee,0.9959,0.05270555165144061,8.772265696087352,0.43740620490620497,0

Fox News,"Biden's billion-dollar plan to build 500,000 EV chargers has yet to yield a single charger",2023-12-06 12:19:00,Thomas Catenacci,"President Biden's trillion-dollar infrastructure package included billions of dollars to fund an ambitious plan to construct a massive nationwide electric vehicle (EV) charging network, but has yet to yield a single charger two years later.Overall, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) earmarked $7.5 billion for electric vehicle chargers — $5 billion for the so-called National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program and another $2.5 billion in discretionary funds for charging and fueling infrastructure — as part of the federal government's ambitious effort to expand EV ownership and reduce carbon emissions.However, just $101.5 million has been distributed for seven state NEVI awards and just two projects, located in Columbus, Ohio, and Pittston, Pennsylvania, have begun construction, according to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation which was established by the IIJA. At its current pace, the billion-dollar program, designed to build out a network of 500,000 chargers and award $5 billion in five years, will fund a handful of projects and dish out just $250 million in that time frame.""Too many members of Congress think ‘Field of Dreams’ is a blueprint for infrastructure: build it and they will come. No, they won’t come. Because Americans didn’t want EVs when this wasteful spending was passed and they don’t want them now, even with all the massive subsidies and incentives to buy EVs,"" Daren Bakst, the director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center for Energy and Environment, told Fox News Digital.INTERNAL DEM MEMO CLAIMS GOP BILL OUTLAWING EV MANDATES MAY LEAD TO PREMATURE DEATHSDeveloping a massive electric vehicle charging network is vital to achieve President Biden's goal of ensuring 50% of car purchases are electric by 2030. (Anna Moneymaker/Pool/Getty Images | Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Bakst added that car dealers are continuing to warn of waning interest in EVs and manufacturers are rethinking their EV strategies. Last month, in a letter to President Biden, a coalition of thousands of car dealers from around the country said they opposed any EV mandate, saying ""enthusiasm has stalled"" for EVs and noting their lots are full of EVs consumers don't want.Bakst further called for Congress to fully defund the NEVI program to save taxpayers money.HOUSE SET TO HOLD VOTE ON BILL STRIKING DOWN BIDEN'S EV PUSH: 'RADICAL AND UNATTAINABLE'""Market realities influence the states that play a central role in whether EV chargers will be built,"" Bakst continued. ""Therefore, it shouldn’t be a surprise that no EV chargers have been built using the $7.5 billion. States don’t want to waste time and money on building EV chargers that will fail.""""The lack of demand for EVs is part of the equation, but so too are the technological shortcomings of EVs and the rural nature of many states,"" he said. ""Then there’s also the Biden administration imposing inflexible and stringent federal requirements, something that states have said will cause problems in implementing the NEVI program. As it is, more than half of the states have not even started soliciting bids for EV chargers.""According to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, the seven public conditional NEVI awards were announced in Ohio, Hawaii, Maine, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Alaska and Kentucky. And 17 states are in the process of soliciting more proposals and applications for future EV charging station projects, a process that can take months or years.""Under the Biden-Harris Administration, all 50 states plus Puerto Rico and D.C. have received historic funding to advance, for the first time in the nation’s history, the buildout of a convenient and reliable national charging network,"" a Joint Office spokesperson told Fox News Digital.According to Cox Automotive data, factoring in generous tax credits, the average transaction price for electric cars was $53,469 as of July, while the average price of gas-powered vehicles was $48,334. And the Department of Energy reported that the average range of model year 2021 gasoline vehicles was 403 miles, compared to the median 234-mile range of model year 2021 EVs. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)""Since the President took office there has been a 70% increase in charging ports now in place, and as states move quickly and deliberately to energize even more EV chargers stamped Made-in-the-USA, Americans can be confident that we are on track to meet our ambitious goals,"" the spokesperson added.Under the IIJA's NEVI Program, funding is designed to be distributed to all 50 states, which then award funding to private developers who construct the charging stations.In addition to the goals of distributing all $5 billion earmarked for the program by 2026 and building 500,000 total chargers, the program is designed to ensure a charger is built at least every 50 miles along major U.S. highways.""We need to move much faster,"" said Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit group that advocates for the adoption of EVs on a mass scale.""We applaud the seven states that have awarded funding,"" he continued. ""We continue to urge states to accelerate their work to issue [requests for proposal] and work with vendors to create a national charging network that is critical to accelerating electrification.""FORD DRAMATICALLY SCALES BACK EV PLANT AMID PLUMMETING SALES IN BLOW TO BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY GOALSMeanwhile, the Columbus project touted by the Biden administration as the first success story of the NEVI program broke ground in October, but isn't expected to be operational until early next year, more than 24 months after the IIJA was passed and signed into law in late 2021. The Ohio Department of Transportation said the project will consist of four chargers, which may take up to 40 minutes to give an EV an 80% charge.""The President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help us win the EV race by working with states, labor, and the private sector to deploy a historic nationwide charging network that will make EV charging accessible for more Americans,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in February 2022. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)The Pittston project will also consist of four 350-kilowatt charging ports located in a highway service area.Using NEVI funds, Ohio and Pennsylvania are both planning to construct dozens of additional fast-charging stations statewide by the end of 2024.And, in addition to the NEVI program, the $2.5 billion earmarked under the Department of Transportation’s Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program has yet to be distributed or awarded anywhere.

This time around, the Wolverines will try to avoid an upset with a matchup against the red-hot Alabama Crimson Tide.""Michigan has been at the top for most of the season. They had those huge results,"" Adam Pullen, assistant director of trading at Caesars, told Fox News Digital.""They’re just blowing teams out left and right. Obviously, they had a few close games in the remaining three games of the season. All won by single digits. Penn State, Maryland and Ohio State. Once Georgia lost, that further cemented them as the definite No. 1.""After the second week of the 2023 college football season, the Alabama Crimson Tide were deemed too flawed to make a run at the CFP as discussions about Nick Saban’s retirement began.None of it was accurate.Since losing to Texas in early September, Alabama has ripped off 11 straight wins, including an impressive victory over No.1 Georgia in the SEC title game.The Crimson Tide were selected over Florida State as the fourth and final playoff team, setting off a massive debate over the past several days.""This is just one of those years where — and there have been other years like this — where somebody that may have been deserving got left out,"" Saban said on Sunday, according to CBS Sports. ""Florida State, certainly, going undefeated did everything they could to get into the playoffs. Unfortunately, probably because of the injury to their quarterback, are not going to have that opportunity.""MICHIGAN'S BLAKE CORUM BELIEVES TEAM ALREADY HAS 'CHIP ON OUR SHOULDER' GOING INTO CFPWhile many feel that FSU should have been in the CFP over Alabama, the Crimson Tide are not the same team that lost to Texas in Week 2.The Alabama Crimson Tide celebrate with the SEC championship trophy after defeating the Georgia Bulldogs 27-24 in the SEC championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta Dec. 2, 2023. (Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)After that loss, Jalen Milroe did not play against South Florida as Saban gave Ty Simpson and Tyler Buchner a shot under center. Following a less-than-impressive win, Saban turned back to Milroe, who turned himself into a player who has had odds of winning the Heisman at times this season.In the final 11 weeks of the season, Milroe was brilliant, accounting for 28 touchdowns and throwing just four interceptions since the September loss to Texas.""We won 11 games in a row and beat the No. 1 team in the country, so we're not the same team that we were when we played Texas earlier in the season,"" Saban said. ""We were kinda in transition at the quarterback position. It was unsettling. I think it affected our team.""Alabama was rewarded with a matchup against No. 1 Michigan in what will be a game between two traditional college football powers at the most storied venue in the sport.""You see Alabama a close second choice of two to one. Michigan’s plus-185. But the line says it right there,"" Pullen continued. ""The game is almost a pick'em game. Michigan is a small favorite. It just shows you that those two teams are very close in the ratings. Even though it is a one and four matchup. You’ve gotta throw the seeding out the window when you get to this stage.""Texas is back.Those three words can finally be said with certainty after head coach Steve Sarkisian led the Longhorns to their first Big 12 title since 2009 and the school's first-ever appearance in the CFP.They did so by blowing the doors off of Oklahoma State in their final Big 12 game.Sophomore quarterback Quinn Ewers set a Big 12 title game passing record, throwing for 452 yards and passing Oklahoma’s Sam Bradford on the list.Texas put it on Oklahoma State early and often, heading into halftime with a 35-14 lead.

Obviously, everybody sees what they last saw,"" Pullen said when asked if the way Washington and Texas won their conference championships plays a role in the odds.""To me, the Big 12 wasn’t as strong, but they definitely closed it out with a big win, winning against Oklahoma State. A lot of people were hoping to see another Texas-OU [Oklahoma] rematch, which didn’t occur. But, look, Texas handled their business.

A group of more than a dozen Republican lawmakers, led by Reps. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., and Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., introduced the legislation in July in response to the Biden administration's tailpipe emissions regulations unveiled months earlier.""The passage of the CARS Act is a massive victory for every consumer and the entire American auto industry,"" Walberg told Fox News Digital. ""Biden’s mandate has always been unrealistic, and a textbook study on how central planning and Bidenomics simply do not work. Mandating EVs has never been a responsible or affordable solution.""""Americans should always have the option to buy whatever car suits them the best and the House has taken a massive step toward ensuring that opportunity still exists,"" he added.STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES' CLIMATE, COST BENEFITS: 'WON'T ACHIEVE THE GOALS INTENDED'President Biden has set a goal of ensuring 50% of car purchases are electric by 2030. (Stephen Maturen/Getty Images | David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The CARS Act would particularly block regulations proposed in April by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which would significantly increase tailpipe emissions standards for gas-powered cars. The bill would also prohibit any rule mandating the use of a specific technology or regulations that limit the availability of new vehicles based on engine type.If the EPA rule is finalized, the White House projected that a staggering 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases and up to 50% of bus and garbage truck purchases could be electric by 2032.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)They have also argued that a large EV push will benefit Chinese industry which currently dominates global EV battery supply chains.""Voting for the CARS Act and taking a stand against EPA’s de facto ban on most new gasoline, diesel, flex fuel and hybrid vehicles should not be a partisan issue for members of the House,"" American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers Vice President of Government Relations Aaron Ringel told Fox News Digital prior to the vote Wednesday.""Banning vehicle and fuel technologies based on just one category of emissions is unlawful, illogical and bad for consumers, families and our national security,"" Ringel said.

(iStock)They also were shown to have less buildup of amyloid proteins in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.The goal of the restricted eating is to restore the circadian rhythm, the researchers said, which could help counteract the numerous disruptions that Alzheimer’s patients face when it comes to sleep and schedule-related confusion.HIDDEN BELLY FAT COULD SIGNAL ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE RISK 15 YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS SHOW UP, STUDY FINDS""Our study emphasizes the power of feeding timing in aligning the circadian clock and its impact on the brain,"" said senior study author Paula Desplats, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine, in a statement to Fox News Digital.""We were hopeful to see some improvements in pathology, but did not expect such profound effects in reducing plaques and inflammation and improving memory,"" she went on.Compared to a control group of mice that ate on demand, the fasting mice showed improvements in memory, were less hyperactive in the evenings and had fewer sleep disruptions. (iStock)""The effects of time-restricted feeding on lower amyloid pathology were also measurable in blood using markers found in the clinic, which was another important finding.""The researchers hope that these findings will lead to human trials.The goal is to obtain funding to start a pilot study of patients next year.""Accessible interventions like this have great translational potential, as they are available and are usually very well-tolerated,"" Desplats said.The goal is to obtain funding to start a pilot study of patients next year.""This may have special importance for the elderly, as time-restricted eating does not require limitation in calories or change in the diet, but may offer important benefits ranging from metabolic and sleep regulation to potential cognitive improvement.""TIME-RESTRICTED EATING NO MORE BENEFICIAL THAN CALORIC RESTRICTION IN OBESE PATIENTS, STUDY SAYSAdopting a new dietary pattern should not be a replacement for medical care, however, as Desplats emphasized the importance of patients' discussions about options with their clinicians.More than six million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's, and every 67 seconds, someone in America develops the disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.

Fox News,Hunter's ex-business associate blasts Biden's new claim about son's business dealings: 'Complete malarkey',2023-12-07 11:46:00,"Brandon Gillespie , Cameron Cawthorne","EXCLUSIVE: A former business associate of Hunter Biden is pushing back against President Biden after he angrily claimed it was a ""bunch of lies"" that he interacted with his son's foreign business associates.Biden was pressed during a press conference on Wednesday about why he interacted with ""so many"" of his son and brother's foreign business associates, but he denied having any such interactions, despite evidence to the contrary.""I'm not going to comment. I did not, and it's just a bunch of lies,"" Biden responded. ""They're lies. I did not. They're lies.""One of Hunter's former business associates reacted to Biden's comments by telling Fox News Digital that his claim was ""complete malarkey"" and said there is ""plenty of evidence"" to refute his denial.HUNTER BIDEN PAID JOE BIDEN FROM ACCOUNT FOR BIZ THAT RECEIVED PAYMENTS FROM CHINA: COMERPresident Biden has repeatedly defended his son Hunter amid a wave of legal troubles, saying multiple times that his son has done ""nothing wrong"" and that he is ""confident"" of that prior to the Justice Department's appointment of a special counsel to further investigate the matter. (George Frey, Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Fox News Digital has reported extensively on the mounting evidence contrasting Biden's claim, including that Hunter's former friend and longtime business partner Eric Schwerin visited the Obama White House and then-Vice President Biden’s residence dozens of times between 2009 and 2016.Schwerin was the founding partner and managing director of Hunter's now-dissolved firm Rosemont Seneca Partners when he was appointed by then-President Obama to the Commission for the Preservation of America’s Heritage Abroad, an independent U.S. government agency, in early 2015. Obama reappointed him to the commission in January 2017.In addition to being a key player in facilitating Hunter's Chinese business deals, Schwerin was also intimately involved with handling the elder Biden's finances. A person familiar with Schwerin's role in handling the finances previously told Fox News Digital that Schwerin worked on Biden's personal budget and helped coordinate with his tax preparers.The individual also pointed to the frequency of Schwerin's communications with Biden and his top aides and said it was ""inevitable"" Rosemont Seneca business came up in conversations.NATIONAL ARCHIVES TO HAND OVER 62,000 BIDEN RECORDS TO HOUSE GOP, INCLUDING EMAILS USING ALIASESBiden also met with at least 14 of Hunter’s business associates from the U.S., Mexico, Ukraine, China and Kazakhstan over the course of his vice presidency, and was even photographed alongside Hunter giving some of them a tour of the White House's Brady Briefing Room.In a 2016 email to Miguel Magnani, a business tycoon and former Hunter associate from Mexico, Hunter admitted that he had ""brought every single person [Miguel has] ever asked [him] to bring to the F'ing White House and the Vice President's house and the inauguration"" and blasted him for going ""completely silent."" Hunter also said he wanted Magnani to be at the plane with his parents when Biden landed in Mexico City.In February 2016, Hunter Biden emailed his Mexican business partner while en route to Mexico aboard Air Force Two and expressed frustration over apparent radio silence, saying, ""I'd like to know why I've delivered on every single thing you've ever asked - and you make me feel like I've done something to offend you."" (Fox News)Hunter had previously introduced Magnani to his father during a White House tour on Feb. 26, 2014. White House visitor logs show that Magnani and his father, Miguel Aleman Velasco, visited the West Wing on Feb. 26, 2014, and Biden was later photographed with Hunter giving Velasco and Magnani a tour of the White House Brady Press Briefing Room.Additionally, in December 2013, Hunter traveled with Biden on a trip to Asia, which included a stop in China, and introduced him to his Chinese business partner Jonathan Li in the lobby of the hotel where the U.S. delegation was staying.A closed-door interview over the summer with Hunter's former business partner, Devon Archer, revealed that the elder Biden would also have coffee with Li during the visit. Less than two weeks later, Hunter would enter into a joint-venture called BHR Partners, a Beijing-backed private equity firm controlled by Bank of China Limited.BIDEN’S NARRATIVE ON NEVER DISCUSSING BUSINESS DEALS WITH HUNTER CONTINUES TO CRUMBLEPresident Biden departs Dublin Airport on Air Force One with his sister Valerie and son Hunter on April 14. (Julien Behal/Irish Government via Getty Images)The closed-door interview before House Oversight investigators also revealed that Hunter would use his dad as ""defensive leverage"" to send ""the right signals"" to his foreign business partners, while selling him as ""the brand"" that offered ""capabilities and reach,"" as well as a ""unique understanding of D.C."" The transcript said Hunter put his father on speakerphone while meeting with business partners at least 20 times to sell ""the brand.""The elder Biden was also in attendance at a spring 2015 dinner at Washington, D.C.'s upscale restaurant Cafe Milano, which included Burisma board adviser Vadym Pozharskyi. The Biden campaign tried to discredit the New York Post's initial reporting on the controversial dinner in 2020 and said, ""No meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,"" but Archer torpedoed that narrative.Pozharskyi emailed Hunter the following day and said, ""Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It's realty [sic] an honor and pleasure.""WHITE HOUSE, HUNTER BIDEN’S TEAM KEEP SHIFTING GOALPOSTS IN DENYING DAD’S INVOLVEMENT WITH BUSINESSESA top Burisma executive emailed Hunter Biden the day after the April 2015 Cafe Milano dinner to thank him for the ""opportunity to meet"" then-Vice President Biden. (Fox News)A year earlier, Biden attended another dinner at Cafe Milano, according to a House Oversight memo, which included Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, former Kazakhstan Prime Minister Karim Massimov and Kazakh oligarch Kenes Rakishev. Earlier this year, Massimov was sentenced to 18 years behind bars for his reported role in an attempted coup.The committee provided screenshots of bank records they say demonstrate that Baturina, the widow of former Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, wired $3.5 million to Rosemont Seneca Thornton on Feb. 14, 2014, a couple of months before the dinner.Fox News Digital also previously reported on how associates and top staffers at Hunter’s now-defunct company visited the Obama White House more than 90 times when he was vice president in the Obama administration.Biden has repeatedly insisted that he had no knowledge of his son’s foreign business dealings and had no role in influencing them. He also repeatedly said he never spoke with his son about foreign business dealings, despite mounting evidence contradicting this claim.From left: Eric Schwerin, Hunter Biden and President Biden. (Fox News)""First of all, I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with their business, period,"" Biden said in August 2019 during his campaign. ""There wasn't any hint of scandal at all when we were there. It was the same kind of strict, strict rules. That's why I never talk with my son or my brother or anyone else, even distant family about their business interest, period.""Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich pressed Biden earlier this year on whether he lied ""about never speaking with Hunter about his business deals,"" prompting the president to reply, ""No.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHunter's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, declared a few months ago that the first son ""did not share"" his business or his profits with his father, marking another notable shift in the narrative responding to allegations that link Biden to his son’s business dealings.""I can tell you that Hunter did not share his business with his dad,"" Lowell said at the time. ""I can tell you that he did not share money from his businesses with his dad.

But there's a lot of things that LIV Golf has to offer that were very, very enticing, starting with team golf,"" he told Fox News’ Bret Baier. ""Being part of a team is something that's been really big for me throughout my career.""I was part of the Spanish national team from the age of 14 till I graduated college.

And that's where that comes in.""Obviously, it is a factor, and it was an important one, obviously, in this decision. But there's many other things, like I mentioned earlier, that make it so exciting. Once you get past that, the love of the game and wanting to grow it to a global market, being part of the team, being a captain, hopefully being a leader to teammates.

McAfee asked Silver whether he felt obligated to be a part of international relations after mentioning a ""country we’re not the tightest with right now.""CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMNBA Commissioner, Adam Silver speaks to the media during a press conference before the Atlanta Hawks game against the Orlando Magic as part of 2023 NBA Mexico Games on November 9, 2023 at Arena Ciudad de Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico.

I will say, I was reading a lot of those obituaries around Henry Kissinger’s death at 100 where was sort of an exemplar of a great global diplomat,"" Silver said. ""I wanna say, I understand. This is going too far off field maybe from your question — I, of course, believe we have to have a strong military. I’m a big believer. At the same time — call it soft power or call it diplomacy — I think through sport, through culture and through arts, it brings connectivity with people of diverse cultures and backgrounds. Basketball is one of those sports.""Silver then went on to talk about basketball’s influence around the world and what values it teaches before making a point about the importance of children being active when it comes to fighting off obesity and diabetes.""I’m a sports executive not a diplomat, but I think the things that we do around the world by participating in these national games, Olympic games, by taking our games globally, by bringing international players to the United States, by showcasing the very best, by people seeing our values of this game around the world, these principles, I call it like, ‘the rule of law,’ it’s interesting the World Cup of soccer was in Qatar — 200 countries participating — everyone accepted those were the rules. Whatever was going on in those countries, whatever autocrat or dictator, whoever was running those countries, everyone accepted for on that pitch on that soccer field when the ref made the decision, they may have disagreed with it, but those are the rules, and a winner’s declared at the end of the tournament.FAN DIES DURING PELICANS-KINGS GAME AFTER SUFFERING 'MEDICAL EMERGENCY'NBA Commissioner Adam Silver speaks during a press conference prior to the NBA Japan Games 2019. (KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP via Getty Images)""Sports teaches those values. And just lastly, this is an issue for the United States, but really for the whole world. Even though we’re seeing more prosperity in many places, you continue to see issues around childhood obesity, diabetes, and in many cases it’s because kids aren’t active. That’s a whole separate issue that you need fun, engaging platforms like sports just to keep kids running and engaged and wanting to be outside and wanting to do things with physical coordination. That all becomes very important. I think sports is very unique from that standpoint.""Kissinger died last week at the age of 100. The German-born American diplomat, academic and presidential adviser who served as secretary of state for two presidents and left his stamp on U.S. foreign policy for decades pioneered the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, began a rapprochement with China and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 for negotiating the Paris Peace Accords to end U.S. involvement in Vietnam.He also played a leading role in the normalization of diplomatic ties between the U.S. and China under Presidents Nixon and Ford.Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger takes in the game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox on August 28, 2007 at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx borough of New York City.

Fox News,"Hunter indictment a 'nuclear bomb for the Bidens,' as Joe sounds like Clinton during Lewinsky scandal: experts",2023-12-07 21:05:00,Charles Creitz,"After a California grand jury handed down an indictment of first son Hunter Biden, political analysts predicted the bombshell would put President Biden in a self-constructed ""trap"" after he again claimed allegations he was in influence-peddling cahoots with his brother and son were ""lies.""A grand jury empaneled in the Central District of California – which comprises Los Angeles – handed down an indictment against Hunter Biden.""I think a lot of people felt … that David Weiss was going to let these charges skate and Hunter Biden would never be held accountable for making millions of dollars overseas. And a lot of people will say that was inappropriate,"" former Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., said.READ IT: FULL INDICTMENT AGAINST HUNTER BIDENAn excerpt from the indictment obtained by Fox News said ""the defendant engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019.""Duffy also surmised that if legal conditions worsen for the Bidens in this Los Angeles case, that Democrats are going to seek an ""off ramp [and] look to the hair-gel governor"" there in 2024.George Washington University Law Prof. Jonathan Turley told Fox News the indictment may rhetorically box-in President Biden, due to his long-held denials of knowledge or participation in his son's foreign business dealings.Turley riffed that there's some similarity between Biden's denials and former President Clinton's famed attestation, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman,"" during the 1998 Whitewater-Lewinsky scandal.HUNTER BIDEN FACES NEW INDICTMENT IN CALIFORNIAPresident Clinton's denials of relations with intern Monica Lewinsky sounded like Biden's denial of knowledge of his son's dealings, Turley said. (Harry Hamburg/NY Daily News via Getty)""I mean, basically [Biden is] saying ‘I did not have interactions with those people’,"" Turley said.""It didn't work for Clinton. And it's even more insulting here,"" he added, pointing to polling showing a majority of Americans including a swath of Democrats telling pollsters they don't believe Biden on this front.Turley contrasted that with his own prediction that no Democrats would support the GOP's impeachment inquiry.""But what the president is facing is a trap of his own making. He ran for office promising, assuring, the American people that he had no knowledge of these transactions,"" he said. ""That has been directly contradicted. Hunter Biden himself contradicted his father on that. But you have Hunter's close associate saying that that's absolute nonsense, that, of course, he knew.""BIDEN'S HOMETOWN OF SCRANTON REVEALS HOW IT REALLY FEELS ABOUT BIDENOMICS""So, [Joe is] in this, this sort of frozen-in-amber with a story that he cannot possibly maintain,"" he added.Turley later added that the Justice Department has let the statute of limitation run out on the ""most serious"" potential charges against Hunter Biden.At the same time, he proffered that Republicans may actually suffer a political loss in one way from the indictment announcement, because the younger Biden may choose to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, and potentially therefore stymie Congress' ability to question him under oath.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWashington Times opinion editor Charles Hurt added to Fox News that the indictment must be ""like a nuclear bomb going off for the Biden family,"" saying that it must terrify President Biden as he approaches his reelection contest to have his son indicted for something he may or may not be connected to.""The other part of this is regardless [of whether] Joe Biden is completely untainted by any of this in any sort of legal sense or in any sort of business sense, which I would be highly skeptical of – but even if that were the case, he still has lied to the American people about it over and over and over again,"" Hurt said.Harvard Law Professor-Emeritus Alan Dershowitz also reacted to the Hunter Biden indictment, telling FOX News the person who is ultimately responsible for the case not being whisked under the rug is Delaware Judge Maryellen Noreika, who previously rejected a plea deal between the Biden Justice Department and Hunter Biden's attorneys.""Judge Noreika made sure that this was not all covered up by a deal that made no sense,"" he said on ""Hannity.""""I predicted on your show and other shows that Judge Noriega would not accept the deal. I was trashed for it by many academics, by CNN, by many other media – But she did the right thing. She sent it back. And the result has been now much more information coming out to the American public.""Dershowitz said the next step for the Justice Department should be the appointment of a ""real"" special counsel who is independent of the DOJ.Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett has said in the past federal regulation 28 CFR 600.3 contends a special counsel shall be selected from outside the United States government, in a previous argument against Weiss' ultimate validity.Dershowitz argued this person should replace Weiss, who is also the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware.Because if it becomes just an impeachment concern – then half the country won't believe it; half the country will. The same thing happened with Trump. But if there's a special counsel who's credible and who can get to the bottom of this and either clear President Biden or accuse President Biden, I think the American public will,"" Dershowitz concluded.Fox News' David Spunt and William Mears contributed to this report.Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.He joined Fox News in 2013 as a writer and production assistant.",5639,https://www.foxnews.com/media/hunter-indictment-nuclear-bomb-bidens-joe-sounds-like-clinton-during-lewinsky-scandal,https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/0806bc60-d6cd-4beb-be8e-abe363521110/731bb4f0-835d-4960-b9da-70a0496fb4ff/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cgyUI9sP8zj7Zhf5tpOI2wHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country allegation hunter noriega bombshell lot owe jury condition opinion academic back excerpt writer argument sound public cover noreika american charge intern half independent close contribute sort defendant argue happen full similarity statute proffer clinton react democrat brother maintain relation assistant put law deal responsible told course cnn polling stymie comprises monica hurt insult fox inquiry medium ultimate story department biden reporter credible dealing production due information basically california appointment potential bidenomics reelection transaction past political riffed jarrett bomb prediction suffer reveals indict million university possibly republican congress duffy creitz young contends ramp gregg sexual obtain accuse former knew scheme californiapresident ran year connect nuclear delaware loss step cfr held result clear amendment felt surmise rug dershowitz central mears impeachment person dollar associate grand case justice majority charles tax nonsense judge assure make special swath appwashington participation hand pollster foreign interaction predict concern absolute united family alan believe announcement bottom work worsen support legal william previous directly president scranton choose question analyst add attorney gop part hannity plea governor david overseas maryellen regulation trash highly promising skeptical contest state attestation trump join jonathan seek ability select knowledge cahoot hometown feel replace claimed pay federal skate include lewinsky bidens empanel turley denial rhetorically run engage contrast real angeles point previously government father accountable untainted woman time joe bidenan completely washington contradict office news limitation potentially show getty harry spunt wei ultimately daily accept invoke indictment inappropriate approach terrify business district counsel famed reject lie editor whisk trap,-0.8430500000000001,0.05320092214931725,10.194947768281097,0.3973393390646912,0

ABC,"Bloodshed, fear, hunger, desperation: Palestinians try to survive war's new chapter in southern Gaza",2023-12-08 01:47:00,"ISABEL DEBRE Associated Press, SAMY MAGDY Associated Press, and NAJIB JOBAIN Associated Press","RAFAH, Gaza Strip -- The roads are so ravaged that the dead and wounded arrive by donkey cart. Desperate relatives rush bloodied and dust-covered people, many of them children, to the hospital.Naseem Hassan, a 48-year-old Palestinian medic in the Gaza Strip's southern town of Khan Younis, said it had become impossible to walk through Nasser Hospital, with people spread out everywhere. Some patients, terrified or semiconscious, tugged at his sleeve when he squeezed through the halls. They groaned, slept and died on those bloodstained floors, he said.His skeletal staff at the 350-bed hospital has struggled to cope with an influx of over 1,000 patients. Without fresh bandages and gauze, Doctors Without Borders said, patients’ wounds have become seriously infected, in many cases septic.“When I think about it for a moment, I start to cry,” Hassan said by phone, struggling to be heard over the shouts of the doctors and nurses who remained. “It's a good thing I'm too tired to think.”On Dec. 7, United Nations monitors said the hospital received its first delivery of supplies since Nov. 29. The World Health Organization delivered trauma and emergency care supplies to the area for about 4,500 patients.In recent days, Israeli tanks have rumbled into southern Gaza, starting with Khan Younis. It's the opening of a grim new chapter in a war that has already killed over 17,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and displaced what the United Nations estimates to be 1.9 million people. The war — which erupted when Hamas militants rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and abducting more than 240 others — has severely damaged or destroyed as much as 36% of all the buildings across the entire enclave, according to analysis of publicly available satellite imagery from the European Earth observation program Copernicus taken Wednesday.Those who took refuge in southern Gaza from the military campaign that reduced the north to rubble over the past two months now find themselves stuck in a cramped, desperate patch of ever-shrinking land as Israel expands its invasion.“The suffering is really apocalyptic,” said Khaled Abu Shaban, 38, an aid worker near Khan Younis. Israel's intensive shelling has forced agonizing choices, he said. Should he venture out to the supermarket or search for well water, at risk of being killed? Or should he let his young daughters go to sleep hungry and thirsty?His 7-year-old cheered Wednesday, he said, when he brought home a tomato. “It is unacceptable that we are searching for water and anything that we can chew in the 21st century.""The pitched street battles and heavy bombardment have blocked aid groups from delivering vital supplies in Khan Younis, the U.N. said, where hungry families are sometimes streets away from warehouses full of food.On Tuesday, desperate mobs stormed a warehouse where two days' worth of food aid had piled up before distribution, the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency, known as UNRWA, said, lamenting the dangers that stalled delivery. People snatched whatever they could and ran off with sacks of flour.“The hunger war has started,” said Nawras Abu Libdeh, a worker in Khan Younis with the humanitarian organization Medical Aid for Palestinians. “And this is the worst of all wars.”In central Gaza, which has been so far spared Israel’s ground invasion, residents said thousands of jostling Palestinians pounce on aid trucks the moment they arrive, screaming for food and ripping into packages.“There are 8,000 people in this shelter, and any vegetables disappear before I see them because people seize everything so fast,” said Mazen Junaid, a father of six who fled to the central city of Deir al-Balah from northern Gaza. The swelling crowds, he said, make it difficult to breathe and move.The prices of staple foods have ballooned out of reach, residents said, with a bag of flour now some 450 shekels ($121). Sugar, emptied from supermarkets, goes for about 40 shekels ($10) on the black market. Rare wartime luxuries savored over the past few weeks — coffee, eggs, biscuits — have vanished. Without cooking gas, Palestinians chop down whatever trees they find for firewood.“There is hunger, there is nothing: There is no flour, no water,"" said Etimad Hassan, who sleeps pressed together with 21 family members in a small tent in Deir al-Balah. Her voice trembled with rage. “We are not animals. Why do they put us in tents like dogs? At least guarantee us a place for shelter.""Adding to the misery, there is little to no treatment available for the 14% of Gaza's population suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic heart conditions, said the World Health Organization.“Asthmatics do not find inhalers. Diabetics do not find insulin,” said Ebraheem Matar, a doctor at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. “Hypertensive patients do not find receptor blockers.""Hassan said her husband abruptly stopped taking his blood pressure medication when he ran out, a withdrawal doctors warned would increase his risk of heart attack. “I’m worried it will kill him,” she said.Junaid said he spends his days begging for food in the streets and scouring pharmacies and health clinics for any anti-inflammatory medication to blunt his throbbing headaches. He checked five pharmacies Thursday and returned home empty-handed.“We didn’t start this war,"" he said. “What will I do, leave my daughters to die in it?”Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, many of whom already fled fighting two or three times, have set off for the southern city of Rafah on the Egyptian border. The Israeli military air-dropped fliers and called and texted evacuation warnings to thousands of civilians across Khan Younis while pressing deeper into the city.Misery spans the horizon in the southern border town. Thousands of people sleep in the cold outside. Others crowd together wherever they find space.“You find displaced people in the streets, in schools, in mosques, in hospitals,"" said Hamza Abu Mustafa, a schoolteacher in Rafah. ""You find displaced families everywhere.”Chaotic scenes of sickness and filth unfold at the U.N. shelters in Rafah, bursting at the seams. The U.N. humanitarian office said Wednesday that poor sanitation has led to rampant cases of scabies, lice and diarrhea, raising fears that more serious diseases may soon spread.

ABC,"UNLV gunman was unemployed professor who had 150 rounds of ammunition and a target list, police say",2023-12-08 00:48:00,RIO YAMAT Associated Press and BEN FINLEY Associated Press,"LAS VEGAS -- A 67-year-old college professor who was denied jobs at various Nevada colleges and universities stuffed loaded handgun magazines into his waistband before walking into a University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus building and killing three faculty members, police said.After police killed him in a shootout, Anthony Polito was found to be carrying nine magazines for a 9mm handgun he’d legally purchased last year and also a list of targets at the school — although none of those shot were on that list, police said Thursday.He was killed in a shootout with police about 10 minutes after the first reports of shots fired in Beam Hall, a business school building.Police still had no motive for Wednesday's attack, which also left a 38-year-old visiting professor in life-threatening condition at a hospital.The university was to remain closed Friday but was tentatively scheduled to reopen next week for finals.Polito arrived at UNLV at 11:28 a.m., about 15 minutes before the shooting, in a 2007 Lexus that he parked in a lot south of the business school, Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said.Polito got out of the car, placed items in his waistband and then entered Beam Hall at 11:33 a.m. The first reports of gunfire came at 11:45 a.m., McMahill said.Terrified students and professors cowered in classrooms and offices as the gunman roamed the top three floors of UNLV’s five-story Lee Business School.University and city police swarmed into and outside the building. UNLV police Chief Adam Garcia has said the first university officer arrived at the business school within 78 seconds of the gunfire report.Near the main entrance, UNLV officers saw Polito leaving the building and he shot at them, a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department statement said Thursday night.The officers fired back, killing him at the scene.Authorities searched Beam Hall and found two people dead on the third floor and one victim dead on the fourth floor, the statement said.Investigators believe the wounded survivor was shot on the fifth floor, but he managed to make it to the ground floor.Student Jordan Eckermann, who was in a second-floor classroom in the business school when the rampage began, said the timestamp on a short cellphone video he recorded showed the building’s alarm went off at 11:48 a.m., three minutes after the shooting started.It’s unclear how many shots Polito fired, but the sheriff said Polito brought more than 150 rounds of ammunition to the campus.Given that sheer number of rounds, McMahill said he believed Polito may have been intending to open fire on the student union next to the business school, where students were hanging out, eating and playing games.Polito also was carrying what McMahill described as a “target list” of named faculty members both from UNLV and from East Carolina University in North Carolina, where Polito taught at the university’s business school from 2001 to 2017.He resigned from East Carolina as a tenured associate professor, according to a statement Thursday from the university.“None of the individuals on the target list became a victim,” McMahill said, adding that police have contacted everyone on the suspect’s list, except for one person who was on a flight.A dash camera in Polito’s car showed that before heading to campus, he stopped at a post office in Henderson, where he was living, police said.Police discovered that he had dropped off 22 letters to university faculty members across the U.S.Some contained an unknown white powder that was later found to be harmless, police said.Police didn’t immediately disclose the nature of the letters or other details.The sheriff said at a news conference that investigators were still looking into a motive but noted that Polito applied for several jobs at various colleges and universities in Nevada and was denied the job each time.However, Roseman University of Health Sciences in Henderson said Polito had an adjunct faculty contract and taught two courses in the school’s the Master of Business Administration program from October 2018 to June 2022. He left when the program was discontinued, said Jason Roth, a spokesperson for the school.Authorities on Thursday said Polito appeared to be struggling financially. When they arrived at his apartment Wednesday night to search the property, they found an eviction notice taped to his front door, McMahill said.Inside, detectives found a chair with an arrow pointing down to a document “similar to a last will and testament,” McMahill said without elaborating.Also Thursday, UNLV President Keith E. Whitfield identified two of the victims who were killed as business school professors Patricia Navarro-Velez and Cha Jan “Jerry” Chang. Whitfield said the name of the third victim will be released after relatives have been notified of the death.In a letter to students and staff, Whitfield said that the shooting “was the most difficult day in the history of our university.”Navarro-Velez, 39, was an accounting professor who held a Ph.D. and was currently focused on research in cybersecurity disclosures and data analytics, according to the school’s website.Chang, 64, was an associate professor in the business school’s Management, Entrepreneurship & Technology department and had been teaching at UNLV since 2001. He held degrees from Taiwan, Central Michigan University and Texas A&M University, according to his online resume. He earned a Ph.D. in management information systems from the University of Pittsburgh.The attack at UNLV terrified a city that experienced the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history in October 2017, when a gunman killed 60 people and wounded more than 400 after opening fire from the window of a high-rise suite at Mandalay Bay on the Las Vegas Strip, just miles from the UNLV campus.It wasn’t immediately clear how long Polito had been living in the Las Vegas area.One of Polito’s former students at East Carolina, Paul Whittington, said Polito often talked about his regular trips to Las Vegas. He also seemed obsessive over anonymous student reviews at the end of each semester, Whittington said.Polito told Whittington’s class that he remembered the faces of students who gave him bad reviews and would express that he was sure who they were and where they sat, pointing at seats in the classroom, Whittington said.“He always talked about the negative feedback he got,” said Whittington, now 33, who took Polito’s intro to operations management class in 2014. “He didn’t get a lot of it, but there would always be one student every semester, or at least one student every class, that would give a negative review. And he fixated on those.”___",6654,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/unlv-gunman-unemployed-professor-150-rounds-ammunition-target-105488098,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/65fc95a1-0a28-4369-b250-e653e98eb62d/wirestory_8f75fc1c5f863f5d928c48aa1189aedf_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police semester cha lot metropolitan survivor enter condition gunfire wound alarm top short record back minute manage relative hang patricia master intend teach seat fire resign feedback stop handgun long close described michigan hall similar whittington tenure financially campus leave unlv classroom tentatively jan system open difficult front struggle vega detective taiwan review day express property kevin told course remain negative release suspect school wednesday discontinue experienced faculty jason department carry head begin accounting ammunition deny fixate contact accord information texas video paul harmless technology drop eat history earn taped mcmahill october living floor suite modern jerry student operation adam university north bay talk polito carolina play round obsessive former search unknown friday year immediately shoot stuffed post dead sat cybersecurity disclosure beam member held report spokesperson found clear reopen victim visit central person associate arrow june program remember resume number whitfield trip kill rampage attack adjunct lee roth make henderson schedule chief purchase city deadliest keith college administration professor testament cower opening apartment contract online degree waistband believe garcia county timestamp disclose president chair motive science job entrance add swarm data park walk chang research building intro ground week fourth conference notify strip gunman place powder dash union identify legally analytics car staff mandalay window regular note focus anonymous roam document jordan taught point give night left arrive cellphone class individual sheriff health shootout nevada roseman notice clark management eckermann load thursday statement brought camera item office contain shot news target show letter apply entrepreneurship unclear eviction sheer east list lexus discover investigator mile magazine white south anthony terrify business nature currently officer,-0.9937,0.31559963931469787,11.49181208053691,0.2749373710580607,0
ABC,"Houston has a population that's young. Its next mayor, set to be elected in a runoff, won't be",2023-12-08 00:40:00,JUAN A. LOZANO Associated Press,"HOUSTON -- A mayoral runoff Saturday between state Sen. John Whitmire, 74, and U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, 73, has the fourth-largest city in the U.S. on the verge of picking a new leader who cuts against Houston's demographic trends. Census figures show Houston is becoming younger, with a median age of around 35 and 25% of the population below 18.Although other City Halls have not exactly been swept up in a youth movement — New York Mayor Eric Adams is 63 and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is 70 — the choices in Houston have frustrated some of voters in the Democratic stronghold, particularly younger ones, at a time when the party is searching for new political stars in Texas who might be able to end 30 years of GOP dominance statewide.“I think the main issue is identifying with the politician. A lot of young people can’t,” said Julian Meza, a 19-year-old history student at Houston Community College who plans to cast a ballot. He added, “I don’t really want to vote for them, but I have no other choice.”Fellow student Amanda Estela Portillo, a 19-year-old biology major, agreed that she finds it difficult to connect with older candidates.“It seems like the older generations ... they kind of just like brush it off and are just like, ’You don’t know what you’re talking about kid. You’re too young.’ And I feel like it’s a sense of hopelessness that a lot of us feel,” Portillo said.Whitmire and Jackson Lee, who emerged from a crowded field of nearly 20 candidates in the Nov. 7 general election, have both touted their decades of experience in political office. But they also say the perspectives of younger voters are important to them and have promised to make young individuals a part of their administration.On Sunday, Jackson Lee attended an outreach event cosponsored by Houston-based Rap-A-Lot Records that featured speeches by candidates and musical performances and aimed to encourage voters, including younger ones, to go to the polls.“I want this administration to have people saying, ’I’m good because the mayor cares about me. I’m good because City Hall is open to me,'” Jackson Lee said onstage alongside local rappers including Lil Bushwick, the son of Bushwick Bill, a founding member of the iconic Houston rap group the Geto Boys.Whitmire, for his part, has held various campaign events with organizations for young professionals, telling one gathering in August that “the future of Houston needs a voice at City Hall.”“Why do young people not get involved in city politics? I think a lot of them have given up on the process,” Whitmire said Sunday after a mayoral forum. “I understand their cynicism and their frustration. And that’s what I’m offering, experience of a can-do candidate.”Von Cannon, 41, who operated a food truck at Sunday's voter outreach event, said advancing age isn't necessarily a problem for a candidate, but “I think authenticity is a big thing that younger voters look for.”Ronda Prince, chief of operations at Rap-A-Lot Records, said experience is important “but you just cannot ignore and leave out the concerns, the issues that young people have. If you want to reach young people, talk to young people.”Getting younger voters to the polls, particularly in local elections, remains a “huge puzzle” in the city and around the country, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston.“Houston is changing. It’s becoming much younger and certainly more Latino, and the demographics in terms of who runs for office and who wins ... doesn’t always reflect those changes,” Rottinghaus said.An analysis by Rottinghaus suggested that two-thirds of voters in the Nov. 7 election were over the age of 55. The Harris County Clerk’s Office said a review of early voting for the runoff has found an average age of about 62.Age has been an issue in other political contests — such as next year's presidential race, which seems likely to pit President Joe Biden, 80, against former President Donald Trump, 77. In Texas' general election last month, voters rejected a proposed change to the state Constitution that would have raised the mandatory retirement age for judges by four years, to 79.One challenge with reaching out to younger people has been making voting more convenient, according to Rottinghaus.Officials in Democratic-led Harris County, where Houston is located, expanded access during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 with drive-thru voting and 24-hour polling locations, two initiatives popular with younger voters. But those were later banned by the GOP-led Texas Legislature.Rottinghaus also said some younger voters might not vote because issues they care about often don't factor into local elections.While the Houston mayoral race has been dominated by discussion of crime, crumbling infrastructure and potential budget shortfalls, other matters that are important to voters like Meza and Portillo, such as supporting reproductive and immigration rights and the LGBTQ+ community, are largely absent.Kit Delgado, a 19-year-old art student at Houston Community College, said that while a mayor can’t really impact those issues much, it’s important to younger voters to have someone in office who shares their values.“If we have a mayor who supports our ideas, maybe we can get a governor who has support of our ideas and then representatives. I think that’s a good reason to start voting locally, like for my age group,” Delgado said.___",5439,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/houston-population-young-mayor-set-elected-runoff-105488005,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/aae1ec9c-7ff2-4d80-94e6-5e61e68711dc/wirestory_43308e60628f2947173eccfac5ca020a_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country raise reason lot change record share frustrate reproductive win huge promise remains kind amanda sunday forum suggest bass major encourage locally ban hall emerge professional population leave perspective biology eric aim politics stronghold open difficult matter start frustration review estela runoff demographic particularly democratic decade lil authenticity polling poll crime reach dominance expand saturday bill cast crumble trend ballot rap biden local mandatory harris accord august john texas event potential clerk political sheila experience history crowd brush advance student operation adam figure university geto talk idea young agree candidate truck locate cosponsor julian former search pick performance field year connect understand cannon voting brandon tout member held prince attend found leader reflect speech politician operate portillo convenient average meza party lee census judge make verge factor voter chief discussion latino houston analysis city college administration professor retirement iconic largely concern early feature delgado onstage popular access plan gathering county support fellow campaign movement bushwick president month cynicism science add rapper gop part governor group swept find presidential pandemic shortfall infrastructure term contest state trump ignore mayoral identify challenge food feel representative big york vote future outreach process include mayor alongside general important whitmire puzzle rottinghaus run angeles budget impact give initiative pit jackson youth constitution individual musical involve time cut race joe issue office art voice star generation immigration problem show donald median propose offering election dominate location ronda age necessarily choice hopelessness community kid reject organization,0.5747,0.11031439602868173,9.473583093179634,0.376937493400908,0

ABC,Federal judge poised to prohibit separating migrant families at US border for 8 years,2023-12-08 00:33:00,ELLIOT SPAGAT Associated Press,"SAN DIEGO -- A federal judge was poised Friday to prohibit separation of families at the border for purposes of deterring immigration for eight years, preemptively blocking resumption of a lightning-rod, Trump-era policy that the former president hasn't ruled out if voters return him to the White House next year.U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw tentatively approved a court settlement in October between the Justice Department and families represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU says no one formally objected, clearing the way to end the case nearly seven years after it was filed.Sabraw, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, ordered an end to separations in June 2018, six days after then-President Donald Trump halted them on his own amid intense international backlash. The judge also ordered that the government reunite children with their parents within 30 days, setting off a mad scramble because government databases weren't linked. Children had been dispersed to shelters across the country that didn't know who their parents were or how to find them.Under the proposed settlement, the type of “zero-tolerance” policy under which the Trump administration separated more than 5,000 children from parents who were arrested for illegally entering the country would be prohibited until December 2031.Children may still be separated but under limited circumstances, as has been the case for years. They include if the child is believed to be abused, if the parent is convicted of serious crimes or if there are doubts that the adult is the parent.Families that were separated may be eligible for other benefits — legal status for up to three years on humanitarian parole; reunification in the United States at government expense; one year of housing; three years of counseling; legal aid in immigration court. But the settlement doesn't pay families any money. In 2021, the Biden administration considered compensating parents and children hundreds of thousands of dollars each, but talks stalled.As he seeks to return to the White House in next year's elections, Trump has been noncommittal whether he would try to resume family separations. He defended the results in an interview with Univision last month, claiming without evidence that it “stopped people from coming by the hundreds of thousands.”",2337,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/federal-judge-poised-prohibit-separating-migrant-families-us-105488006,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c522cc31-c10a-4913-8f72-62b384539a94/wirestory_2720c59c1873a9c3fc53da1aad4d1a80_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country shelter enter dollar aclu case justice return june resume backlash doubt judge american voter stop court aid policy administration illegally type disperse interview adult united family rule arrest abuse believe tentatively legal liberty president month represent convict hundred humanitarian day amid find eligible purpose univision reunification child reunite state crime deter approve trump san preemptively resumption seek union defend clearing department biden scramble consider parent evidence pay federal benefit include parole poise expense dana october government money set housing appoint prohibit george order mad talk international bush house limited circumstance immigration formally sabraw noncommittal border database donald former link propose friday halt thousand civil election year block settlement status separation claim object white separate district compensate diego result intense december counsel,-0.37155,0.25673940949935814,12.29697270471464,0.31755952380952385,0

But the settlement doesn't pay families any money. In 2021, the Biden administration considered compensating parents and children hundreds of thousands of dollars each, but talks stalled.As he seeks to return to the White House in next year's elections, Trump has been noncommittal whether he would try to resume family separations. He defended the results in an interview with Univision last month, claiming without evidence that it “stopped people from coming by the hundreds of thousands.”",2337,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/federal-judge-poised-prohibit-separating-migrant-families-us-105488008,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c522cc31-c10a-4913-8f72-62b384539a94/wirestory_2720c59c1873a9c3fc53da1aad4d1a80_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country shelter enter dollar aclu case justice return june resume backlash doubt judge american voter stop court aid policy administration illegally type disperse interview adult united family rule arrest abuse believe tentatively legal liberty president month represent convict hundred humanitarian day amid find eligible purpose univision reunification child reunite state crime deter approve trump san preemptively resumption seek union defend clearing department biden scramble consider parent evidence pay federal benefit include parole poise expense dana october government money set housing appoint prohibit george order mad talk international bush house limited circumstance immigration formally sabraw noncommittal border database donald former link propose friday halt thousand civil election year block settlement status separation claim object white separate district compensate diego result intense december counsel,-0.37155,0.25673940949935814,12.29697270471464,0.31755952380952385,0

ABC,High-profile attacks on Derek Chauvin and Larry Nassar put spotlight on violence in federal prisons,2023-12-08 00:15:00,MICHAEL R. SISAK Associated Press and MICHAEL BALSAMO Associated Press,"Derek Chauvin was stabbed nearly two dozen times in the law library at a federal prison in Arizona. Larry Nassar was knifed repeatedly in his cell at a federal penitentiary in Florida.The assaults of two notorious, high-profile federal prisoners by fellow inmates in recent months have renewed concerns about whether the chronically understaffed, crisis-plagued federal Bureau of Prisons is capable of keeping people in its custody safe.In the shadow of gangster James “Whitey” Bulger’s 2018 beating death at a West Virginia federal penitentiary and financier Jeffrey Epstein’s 2019 suicide at a Manhattan federal jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, the Bureau of Prisons is again under scrutiny for failing to protect high-profile prisoners from harm.Chauvin, 47, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd in 2020, was hospitalized for a week after he was assaulted Nov. 24 at a medium-security federal prison in Tucson, Arizona — the same complex where an inmate tried to shoot a visitor last year with a contraband gun.Chauvin's suspected attacker, an ex-gang leader, told correctional officers he would have killed him if they hadn't responded when they did, prosecutors said. He was charged last week with attempted murder and has been moved out of Chauvin's prison to a federal penitentiary next door.Chauvin’s family is “very concerned about the facility’s capacity to protect Derek from further harm,"" his lawyer, Gregory Erickson, said. ""They remain unassured that any changes have been made to the faulty procedures that allowed Derek’s attack to occur in the first place.""Nassar, 60, the ex-U.S. women’s gymnastics team doctor who sexually abused athletes, was treated for a collapsed lung after he was stabbed multiple times in the neck, chest and back on July 9 at a federal penitentiary in Coleman, Florida. His attacker was stopped by other inmates before officers arrived.The attacks on Chauvin and Nassar, among dozens of other assaults and deaths involving lesser-known federal inmates, are symptoms of larger systemic problems within the Justice Department’s largest agency that put all 158,000 federal prisoners at risk. They include severe staffing shortages, staff-on-inmate abuse, broken surveillance cameras and crumbling infrastructure.The violence has challenged a perception — repeated by some lawyers and criminal justice experts quoted in the news media when Chauvin was sentenced last year — that federal prisons are far safer than state prisons or local jails. The inmates suspected of attacking Chauvin and Nassar both have violent histories.After Chauvin’s attack, his mother complained in a since-deleted Facebook post that the Bureau of Prisons was keeping her in the dark on details of the assault and his medical condition — echoing complaints early in the COVID-19 pandemic when families weren’t informed about inmates who were dying from the virus until it was too late. The agency said it gave updates on Chauvin’s health to everyone he asked to be notified.“Derek Chauvin’s murder of George Floyd was a tragic loss of life and a horrifying reminder of the inequality that pervades our justice system,” said Daniel Landsman, the deputy director of policy at the criminal justice advocacy group FAMM, or Families Against Mandatory Minimums.“However, no one’s sentence, regardless of their offense, includes being subjected to violence while they’re in prison. The attack on Chauvin is the latest in a long list of incidents that highlight the urgent need for comprehensive independent oversight of our federal Bureau of Prisons,” Landsman said.An ongoing Associated Press investigation has uncovered deep, previously unreported problems within the Bureau of Prisons, including rampant sexual abuse and other staff criminal conduct, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including inmate assaults and suicides.The Bureau of Prisons, with more than 30,000 employees, 122 prison facilities and an annual budget of about $8 billion, has drawn increased oversight from Congress and scrutiny from government watchdogs in the wake of Bulger and Epstein’s deaths.A law passed last year requires the Bureau of Prisons to overhaul outdated security systems and replace broken cameras — one of several critical issues that came to light in the wake of Epstein’s suicide. In some instances, however, the agency has been slow to comply, blaming technological challenges.Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, meanwhile, has issued a pair of scathing reports citing management failures, flawed policies and widespread incompetence as factors in Bulger’s killing and blaming a “combination of negligence, misconduct and outright job performance failures” for Epstein’s suicide.""The numerous and serious transgressions that occurred in this matter came to light largely because they involved a high-profile inmate,"" Horowitz wrote in a June report on Epstein’s suicide. “The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and Bulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the custody and care of such inmates.""High-profile inmates are labeled in the federal prison system as “Broad Publicity” because of their widespread publicity as a result of their criminal activity or notoriety as public figures. Incidents involving them typically attract far greater media attention and public curiosity than other prison mayhem, but they're often a sign of larger dysfunction.In the wake of Epstein’s suicide, officials at a federal jail in Brooklyn took the unusual step of making his longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell wear paper clothing and sleep without bedsheets. They woke her up with flashlights every 15 minutes to make sure she was still alive.But that’s far from the norm. In June, another high-profile inmate, “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, was found unresponsive in his cell by correctional officers making rounds after midnight at a federal prison medical center in North Carolina. Kaczynski previously attempted suicide while awaiting trial in 1998 but rejected a psychiatrist’s diagnosis that he was mentally ill.Responding to Horowitz, Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters wrote that lessons learned from the investigation would be “applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.” But asked by the AP last week, the agency declined to detail what changes, if any, have been made, saying it does not “discuss specific security practices.”Peters also promised a sweeping security review after the Tucson gun breach in November 2022, telling the AP that the Bureau of Prisons would assess safety measures and identify lapses at prison camps, potentially providing lessons for tightening protocols throughout the agency. Asked for an update, the agency said it “does not comment on matters related to investigations.""A spokesperson, Benjamin O’Cone, said the Bureau of Prisons “takes seriously our duty to protect the individuals entrusted in our custody, as well as maintain the safety of correctional employees and the community.”“As part of that obligation, we review safety protocols and implement corrective actions when identified as necessary in those reviews to ensure that our mission of operating safe, secure, and humane facilities is fulfilled,” O’Cone said.Chauvin began his incarceration in solitary confinement at a maximum-security Minnesota state prison, sequestered from other inmates and kept in his cell 23 hours a day “largely for his own protection,"" his former lawyer wrote in court papers.He transferred to FCI Tucson in August 2022 after making a deal to simultaneously serve all of his punishment for Floyd’s murder in federal prison — a 21-year federal sentence for violating Floyd’s civil rights, which was later reduced by seven months, and a 22½-year state sentence for second-degree murder.Chauvin’s sentencing judge, empathizing with him over his isolation in state prison, expressed optimism that he would fare better with fewer restrictions as a federal inmate.“While for security reasons and for your protection these conditions may have been necessary, I still feel for you and the difficult days you’ve gone through,"" U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson told Chauvin at his July 2022 federal sentencing. ""Hopefully, the Bureau of Prisons will be able to improve these conditions substantially.”Rather than solitary confinement or protective custody, the Bureau of Prisons placed Chauvin in the “dropout yard” — a housing unit for former police officers, ex-gang members, sexual abusers and other high-risk prisoners.Though generally thought to be safer for such inmates than the general prison population, those units still see occasional flashes of violence, like Nassar’s stabbing in a “dropout yard” unit at the U.S. Penitentiary in Coleman, Florida.Nassar, who was also convicted of possessing images of child sexual abuse, was attacked in his cell after he purportedly made a lewd comment while watching a Wimbledon women’s tennis match on TV. An inmate, identified in prison records as Shane McMillan, stabbed him repeatedly before four other inmates pulled him away.McMillan was previously convicted of assaulting a federal prison officer in Louisiana in 2006 and attempting to stab another inmate to death at the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, in 2011. He remains locked up in Florida and has yet to be charged with attacking Nassar, who was moved to a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania. Court records did not list a lawyer for him.In May 2018, Nassar's lawyers said, he was attacked within hours of being placed in general population at the Arizona federal penitentiary next to Chauvin’s prison. Nassar’s lawyers, who have not shared details of that assault, blamed it on the notoriety of his case and his seven-day televised sentencing.In contrast, Chauvin’s move to federal prison appeared to start off well. In a brief glimpse of his life as a federal inmate, he appeared by video from FCI Tucson in March — wearing a prison-issued short-sleeve blue button-down shirt — to plead guilty in a Minnesota tax evasion case.Last month, Chauvin mailed court papers from the prison — complete with his handwritten name and inmate number on the envelope — in a longshot bid to overturn his federal guilty plea. In them, he complained that his ex-lawyer had ignored supposed new evidence of his innocence, but said nothing about how he was being treated behind bars.Prior to Chauvin’s stabbing, there were no public reports of violence toward him — but he was still at risk.John Turscak, the former Mexican Mafia gang leader and one-time FBI informant accused of attacking Chauvin, told investigators he thought about stabbing him for a month before seeing an opportunity to strike in the law library around 12:30 p.m. local time on Nov. 24, federal prosecutors said.Turscak stabbed Chauvin 22 times with an improvised knife, only stopping when correctional officers reached him and used pepper spray to subdue him, prosecutors said. FCI Tucson has struggled with low staffing in the past, but the Bureau of Prisons said nearly every correctional officer position is now filled and staffing wasn't an issue the day Chauvin was attacked.Two employees were working voluntary overtime, but none were on mandatory overtime, nor was the prison using augmentation — a practice in which nurses, teachers, cooks and other staff are pulled from other duties to guard inmates, the agency said.Chauvin’s lawyer said he confirmed to his family that allegations in Turscak’s charging document were accurate, adding that the assailant ambushed him from behind.Turscak told the FBI that he attacked Chauvin because he is a high-profile inmate for killing Floyd, prosecutors said. Turscak said he chose Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, as a symbolic connection to the Black Lives Matter movement and the Mexican Mafia’s “Black Hand” symbol, prosecutors said.Turscak, 52, led a faction of the Mexican Mafia in the Los Angeles area in the late 1990s and was due to be released from federal prison in 2026 after serving more than 30 years for racketeering and conspiring to kill a gang rival. Court records did not list a lawyer for him.Now, after Turscak’s arrest and Chauvin’s return to FCI Tucson, Erickson said he and his client’s family have more questions — and concerns. They are continuing to push for answers on additional measures, if any, that are being taken to protect Chauvin, and will pursue “any avenues available under the law to ensure his continued safety,” Erickson said.“It remains a mystery how the perpetrator was able to obtain and possess dangerous materials"" to fashion a makeshift knife, ""and how a guard was unable to reach and apprehend the perpetrator until Derek had been stabbed 22 times,” Erickson said.“Why was Derek allowed into the law library without a guard in close enough proximity to stop a possible attack? the lawyer said. “His family continues to wonder.”__",13129,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/high-profile-attacks-derek-chauvin-larry-nassar-put-105487720,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5d24a8af-62e2-4f99-a795-e48da23f910f/wirestory_410aa291befb9a8dc29e0d77fa13c96e_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,slow ghislaine increase supermax condition response unabomber change mayhem investigation ongoing quote protective continue perception public pull uncovered unusual remains critical trial charge ambush pervades highlight independent large annual minnesota fare pursue guard florence abuse deputy shortage bureau system difficult maintain matter law put overhaul day beating express told chronic transfer unable tragic multiple release mother knife child harm colette jeffrey renew humane mcmillan crumble coleman repeatedly department strike fashion move evidence knifed august informant paper mafia late video manhattan flashlight correctional violence drawn voluntary measure hamper louisiana gang pepper technological north george complex action wake horowitz transgression envelope concerned lung facebook require sexual accuse former life performance presumably shoot arizona overtime loss step michael complaint result found cell handwritten clothing larry team occasional yard tucson proximity justice deficiency dangerous minneapolis confinement corrective guilty attack label hospitalize tax cook optimism misconduct fail punishment hand whitey policy bid largely concern early augmentation possess opportunity bulger stabbed family abuser floyd secure work shadow safer implement fellow purportedly movement solitary virus convict mentally blue part posse death group pandemic avenue failure mystery overturn rival week magnuson serve low match update image identify sexually ted notoriety staff improvised televise incompetence attacker position federal include systemic oversight norm general activity flash attention give blame protocol severe murder woman employee housing landsman involve time collapse isolation additional detail deep violent instance comply provide problem daniel tighten watch inmate numerous obligation list empathize contraband fill rampant march fci security great reject complain area police subdue allegation tv visitor reason available dozen respond combination broken november derek record share glimpse back minute complete return watchdog reminder promise broad tennis gregory breach discus expert stop improve facility long psychiatrist custody continued close sentence thanksgiving doctor symptom agency athlete reduce simultaneously teacher nassar famm population assailant prisoner unit arrest perpetrator outright stab procedure handle assault unreported inequality practice struggle start evasion deal review kaczynski lock write suicide library remain learn inspector bedsheets push suspect mail reach entrust chauvin medium emergency shane neck fulfil turscak dark nurse negligence begin symbol local mandatory horrify due capable woke particular publicity chose past paul symbolic maxwell escape widespread broader challenged answer james conduct figure west sign await sleep congress mexican carolina round confirm center light apprehend safety attract obtain press notorious friday civil year gun comprehensive duty unresponsive bop post client understaffed related member report inform diagnosis typically spokesperson advocacy prosecutor official leader scrutiny echo sweep unassured scathing makeshift outdated associate repeat criminal offense june cone case fbi epstein number florida kill shirt operating judge make camp brooklyn factor jail court possible july longshot violate suppose colorado flaw lawyer medical lesson recent gangster wimbledon safe hour confidant month wear job question add comment plea prison benjamin black chest incident lead racketeering fact plead state curiosity incarceration risk surveillance ignore place lewd conspire protection spray penitentiary decline feel replace occur generally erickson protect lapse director material virginia specific document chronically connection contrast budget angeles previously government ensure individual health ass management restriction innocence midnight subject issue camera mission urgent especially pennsylvania dropout news potentially accurate pair apply gymnastics sex treat sequester investigator faction capacity attempt billion district longtime pass financier traffic officer faulty,-0.9992000000000001,0.1828014319445502,11.737817715019254,0.4496354458089152,0
ABC,Census Bureau wants to change how it asks about disabilities. Some advocates don't like it,2023-12-08 00:11:00,MIKE SCHNEIDER Associated Press,"The U.S. Census Bureau wants to change how it asks people about disabilities, and some advocates are complaining that they were not consulted enough on what amounts to a major overhaul in how disabilities would be defined by the federal government.Disability advocates say the change would artificially reduce their numbers by almost half. At stake are not only whether people with disabilities get vital resources for housing, schools or program benefits but whether people with disabilities are counted accurately in the first place, experts said.Some also question the timing of the change, which comes just as more people are living with new, long-term conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic.Census Bureau officials say the proposed change on its most comprehensive survey of American life will align the U.S. with international standards, allowing comparisons among countries. They also say it will better capture how disabilities occur in the real world, since they rarely fit neatly into stark yes-or-no boxes that don't account for variations or nuance.“The bureau has spent time, money and energy trying to improve counts of racial and ethnic minorities who have been historically undercounted, but the statistical agency seems willing to adapt questions that will shortchange the numbers of people with disabilities,” said Scott Landes, an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University.“This, in my mind, is illogical,” Landes, who is visually impaired, said in an interview. “There is a piece of me that thinks, 'How dare you — to think that we don't count.' I get offended.""If given final approval, the changes to the American Community Survey questions would be implemented in 2025. The ACS is the most comprehensive survey of American life, covering commuting times, internet access, family life, income, education levels, disabilities and military service, among other topics. The statistical agency was asked to make the change by the National Center for Health Statistics and is accepting public comment on the proposal through Dec. 19.The existing questions ask respondents to answer “yes” or “no” if they have difficulty or “serious difficulty” seeing, even with glasses, or are blind; hearing, or are deaf; concentrating, remembering or making decisions because of a physical, mental or emotional condition; walking or climbing stairs; dressing or bathing; or performing everyday tasks because of a physical, mental or emotional condition.

The international standards being considered by the Census Bureau typically define a person as having a disability if they answer “cannot do at all” or “a lot of difficulty” for any task or function.During testing last year by the Census Bureau, the percentage of respondents who were defined as having a disability went from 13.9% using the current questions to 8.1% under the international standards.

The Associated Press defers whenever possible to the wishes of people or groups in how they choose to be described but uses neutral language that withholds judgment about a person’s condition.Disability advocates said the international standards were formulated without their input. Last month, the Census Bureau's National Advisory Committee recommended that the statistical agency not adopt the change until it meets further with disability advocates and researchers.While the proposal may be better for scientific research, the questions, if approved, will be adapted with the needs of agencies and not people with disabilities in mind, Andrew Houtenville, research director at the Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire, told members of the National Advisory Committee at last month’s meeting.“This has taken a lot of people by surprise,” Houtenville said.Some experts believe the current questions don't adequately account for people with mental health problems, developmental disabilities or chronic health conditions, like those faced by many people living with long COVID.

For instance, a person with limited hearing may be able to function fully with the help of hearing aids but can still identify as having a disability.“You can be proud of your disability and still not want the pain and symptoms of the conditions that lead to that disability.

ABC,"A Chinese military surveillance balloon is spotted in Taiwan Strait, island's Defense Ministry says",2023-12-08 00:09:00,The Associated Press,"TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan’s Defense Ministry says a Chinese military surveillance balloon was spotted in the Taiwan Strait, as well as a large-scale movement of military aircraft and ships.The ministry said the balloon passed southwest of the northern port city of Keelung on Thursday night, then continued east before disappearing, possibly into the Pacific Ocean.However, there seemed to some uncertainty about whether the balloon was operated directly by the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of China's ruling Communist Party. The ministry referred to it both as a “”PLA surveillance balloon"" and as “1 PRC's balloon,"" using the acronym for the People's Republic of China, China's official name.A Defense Ministry spokesperson said they had no additional information.China has long blurred the lines between military and civilian functions, including in the South China Sea, where it operates a huge maritime militia — ostensibly civilian fishing boats that act under government orders to assert Beijing's territorial claims.Taiwan has threatened to shoot down such balloons, but the ministry did not say what, if any, action was taken. It said the balloon was monitored flying at an altitude of approximately 6,400 meters (21,000 feet).It also said 26 Chinese military aircraft were detected, along with 10 Chinese navy ships, in the 24 hours before 6 a.m. Friday. Of the aircraft, 15 had crossed the median line that is an unofficial divider between the sides, but which Beijing refuses to recognize. Some also entered Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone outside the island's airspace, which encompasses the 160 kilometer (100 mile) - wide Taiwan Strait.Taiwan’s military monitored the situation with combat aircraft, navy vessels and land-based missile systems, the ministry said. The incident came just over month before Taiwan is to hold elections for president and the legislature and raises questions about possible Chinese efforts to influence the vote.Such incursions occur regularly as a means of advertising China’s threat to use force to annex the self-governing island republic it considers its own territory, wear down Taiwan’s military capabilities, and impact morale among the armed forces and the public, who remain largely ambivalent to China’s actions.The Chinese missions have also prompted Taiwan to up its purchases of aircraft from the United States, its chief ally, and revitalize its own defense industry, including producing submarines.Beijing strongly protests all contacts between the island and the U.S., but its aggressive diplomacy has helped build strong bipartisan support for Taipei on Capitol Hill.U.S. President Joe Biden vowed sharper rules to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown aerial objects after three weeks of high-stakes drama sparked by the discovery of a suspected Chinese spy balloon transiting much of the country early in the year.",2928,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chinese-military-surveillance-balloon-spotted-taiwan-strait-islands-105487719,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/6e950201-c4bd-4e17-bb6b-ef3605dca916/wirestory_cb16e57f0be3fd77fc4ed52f6122a1a4_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country advertising meter raise boat army ally refer enter fly encompasses unofficial capability divider operate defense strongly huge line threaten ruling altitude public vowed threat party force track side official chief liberation monitor wide long spot balloon vessel possible continued city annex purchase port largely early air communist influence branch regularly refuse zone airspace united strong acronym industry function hour rule diplomacy situation considers northern drama effort china discovery support transit movement directly navy system ship month president wear identification question aerial taiwan remain incursion incident week state suspect surveillance approximately keelung combat southwest biden aggressive occur fishing militia contact sharper cross include pacific kilometer foot operates military island republic impact government recognize night produce build protest taipei territorial uncertainty assert possibly revitalize chinese thursday ostensibly order action hold bipartisan capitol joe additional mission ministry spark beijing potentially median strait disappear legislature aircraft unknown friday east blur election year shoot arm detect mile pla object south prc act maritime spy prompt spokesperson missile territory pass civilian ambivalent,-0.06405,0.0,12.702450592885373,0.35285120285120275,0

During a two-day event starting Friday, selected families will shop at a free toy store, stocked with brand new toys, video games, stuffed animals, scooters, clothes, makeup and musical instruments.“The emotional aspect of being able to give your child something your child wanted versus just something to sort of get you through the holidays, that’s such a load off the minds of somebody who maybe didn’t think they were going to be able to do that,” Paisley said.The Paisleys got a sneak peak on Thursday before the free toy store opened, marveling over the stacks of gifts, wrapping station, Christmas trees and holiday decorations.

In addition to the free groceries, Belmont University, where Paisley graduated, now offers additional services to low-income families, including financial literacy events, music therapy and medicine management.“People come on hard times and we want this to be a safe, welcoming place for everybody, whether you’re volunteering or whether you’re needing the services,"" Williams-Paisley said. ""It’s just a community and we’re all in it together.”The Store received about 2,000 donated items, about half of which came from the Nashville area, and raised $20,000. Parents will be able to drop off their kids at a church next door, where they can play and drink hot chocolate while the adults shop and get gifts wrapped.There are plans for the toy store to become a recurring event, but Williams-Paisley noted The Store would need year-round donations to keep people fed.“We’re still not serving everybody that we want to serve. Food insecurity is on the rise. The USDA just released its report saying 17 million households in this country are facing food insecurity and that’s on the rise from 2021,"" Williams-Paisley said. “There’s so much we want to do.

ABC,Free toy store in Nashville gives families the dignity of choice while shopping for holiday gifts,2023-12-08 00:02:00,KRISTIN M. HALL Associated Press,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- When country music star Brad Paisley and his wife, actress Kimberly Williams-Paisley, helped create a free grocery store in Nashville, Tennessee, their goal was to give families in need the ability to choose their own food in a place that felt like a normal store.This year, The Store is offering that same dignity of choice to parents looking for gifts for the holiday season. During a two-day event starting Friday, selected families will shop at a free toy store, stocked with brand new toys, video games, stuffed animals, scooters, clothes, makeup and musical instruments.“The emotional aspect of being able to give your child something your child wanted versus just something to sort of get you through the holidays, that’s such a load off the minds of somebody who maybe didn’t think they were going to be able to do that,” Paisley said.The Paisleys got a sneak peak on Thursday before the free toy store opened, marveling over the stacks of gifts, wrapping station, Christmas trees and holiday decorations. Volunteers and staff from Belmont University and The Store spent hours unpacking and organizing all the donated toys into sections and decorating while listening to Christmas music.The celebrity couple brought the idea of a free grocery store to Nashville after seeing the concept years ago at the Unity Shoppe in Santa Barbara, California. When The Store launched in early 2020, it was just weeks after a tornado hit the city and before the global pandemic made food access an immediate problem.The Store and its staff adapted, turning into a food delivery service for older people and delivering a million meals in the first year of operation. In addition to the free groceries, Belmont University, where Paisley graduated, now offers additional services to low-income families, including financial literacy events, music therapy and medicine management.“People come on hard times and we want this to be a safe, welcoming place for everybody, whether you’re volunteering or whether you’re needing the services,"" Williams-Paisley said. ""It’s just a community and we’re all in it together.”The Store received about 2,000 donated items, about half of which came from the Nashville area, and raised $20,000. Parents will be able to drop off their kids at a church next door, where they can play and drink hot chocolate while the adults shop and get gifts wrapped.There are plans for the toy store to become a recurring event, but Williams-Paisley noted The Store would need year-round donations to keep people fed.“We’re still not serving everybody that we want to serve. Food insecurity is on the rise. The USDA just released its report saying 17 million households in this country are facing food insecurity and that’s on the rise from 2021,"" Williams-Paisley said. “There’s so much we want to do.

ABC,Michigan school shooting victims to speak as teen faces possible life sentence,2023-12-08 00:00:00,ED WHITE Associated Press,"PONTIAC, Mich. -- A teenager who killed four other students at a Michigan school will listen to their families and survivors of the mass shooting before a judge decides whether the attack will carry a life prison sentence.Crime victims in Michigan have a right to speak in court, and the final hearing Friday in suburban Detroit is likely to be tense and emotional.Ethan Crumbley, 17, could be locked up with no chance for parole, a punishment sought by the Oakland County prosecutor.But because of the shooter's age, Judge Kwamé Rowe also could order a shorter sentence — anywhere from 25 years to 40 years at a minimum — that would eventually make him eligible for release by the state parole board.The shooter pleaded guilty to all 24 charges in the 2021 Oxford High School shooting, including first-degree murder and terrorism.“I’m excited to have my words heard and my story heard,” Kylie Ossege, 19, who was severely wounded, recently told The Associated Press.Crumbley, who was 15 at the time of the shooting, also will have an opportunity to speak in court and possibly explain why he believes he should be spared a life sentence.Defense attorney Paulette Michel Loftin has argued Crumbley deserves an opportunity for parole after his “sick brain” is fixed through counseling and rehabilitation.But after listening to testimony from experts, Rowe said in September that he had found only a “slim” chance that Crumbley could be rehabilitated behind bars.In a journal, the shooter wrote about his desire to watch students suffer and the likelihood that he would spend his life in prison. He made a video on the eve of the shooting, declaring what he would do the next day.Crumbley and his parents met with school staff on the day of the shooting after a teacher noticed violent drawings. But no one checked his backpack for a gun and he was allowed to stay.Like their son, Jennifer and James Crumbley are locked up in the county jail. They are awaiting trial on involuntary manslaughter charges, accused of making a gun accessible at home and neglecting their son's mental health.The shooter killed Madisyn Baldwin, Tate Myre, Hana St. Juliana and Justin Shilling at the school in Oxford Township, about 40 miles (60 kilometers) north of Detroit. Six other students and a teacher also were wounded.The Oxford school district hired an outside group to conduct an independent investigation. A report released in October said “missteps at each level” — school board, administrators, staff — contributed to the tragedy.Crumbley's behavior in class, including looking at a shooting video and gun ammunition on his phone, should have identified him as a “potential threat of violence,” the report said.___",2705,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/michigan-school-shooting-victims-speak-teen-faces-life-105487171,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/81f884c0-4ff8-44f1-be49-0ea8eab5ac77/wirestory_fb10065053ca542b0d443671bab53947_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,victim minimum heard behavior ossege rowe survivor september likelihood wound myre associate madisyn investigation decides tate baldwin chance kill threat guilty attack mass judge sought make expert charge jail trial court punishment kwamé shooter independent desire sentence severely contribute michigan hire teacher opportunity accessible administrator argue family believe county sick deserves recently oxford brain rehabilitate slim backpack attorney tense juliana day group prison lock eligible write phone told level release journal plead township state school crumbley justin identify hana fix story high explain carry staff kylie ammunition paulette parent speak word drawing include excite kilometer parole michel jennifer potential eve video listen checked pontiac neglect suburban misstep october violence board manslaughter mental murder class suffer james student teenager spend conduct home notice possibly north order time await shill final detroit spar violent testimony accuse watch life friday loftin year gun shoot eventually hearing shorter declare mile age oakland district report found counsel involuntary,-0.99315,0.22181146025878,10.752793522267204,0.49357142857142855,0
ABC,Drought vs deluge: Florida's unusual rainfall totals either too little or too much on each coast,2023-12-08 00:00:00,CURT ANDERSON Associated Press,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- In Florida, this year has been a tale of two states as far as rainfall totals, with the southeast coast deluged by sometimes-record rainfall and much of the Gulf of Mexico coast facing a drought.Counties up and down Florida’s west side are under new water use restrictions, especially in one area where the water table has gotten so low that wells could dry up. Now Florida's wettest season is over until late spring.What's happening in Florida could soon become a reality elsewhere, as farmers and residents increasingly have to deal with changes in weather patterns because of climate change. This means hotter temperatures in summer, more powerful hurricanes and other heavier rainstorms and droughts during unexpected seasons.“You know, as the climate changes, we’re going to have to adapt to these extremes,” said Dan Durica, a board member at Tampa’s Sweetwater Organic Community Farm. “And so you have to know how to deal with like the boom and bust of the, like, climate chaos.”For most people, the restrictions affect lawn and landscape watering, which accounts for about half the water used daily in the affected areas. For example, in three counties around Tampa Bay watering is only allowed one day a week depending on a resident’s address and only then before 8 a.m. or after 6 p.m.“The whole western coast of Florida has been impacted by this deficit rainfall during the rainy season,” said Mark Elsner, water supply bureau chief for the South Florida Water Management District. “With the west coast having a deficit about 30%, we didn’t get that recharge that we expected. And as a result, we have lower groundwater levels starting the dry season.”The main driver of the precipitation divide was a weaker than typical high pressure system this summer over the western Atlantic Ocean that led to persistently lighter easterly winds, said Robert Molleda of the National Weather Service office in Miami.“This wind pattern tends to focus most of the precipitation over the interior and eastern side of the peninsula, rather than a more typical east wind pattern which would focus a lot of the daily summer thunderstorms over the western half of the peninsula,” Molleda said in an email.Indeed, in mid-November a no-name storm with wind gusts approaching tropical storm strength lashed Miami, Fort Lauderdale and nearby areas with readings approaching a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over three days, In the Florida Keys, the city of Marathon set an all-time daily record for November when 6.68 inches (17 centimeters) of rain fell in a single day.In April, a storm that sat over Fort Lauderdale dumped nearly 25 inches (63.5 centimeters) of rain in some areas, causing many neighborhoods to flood. And just during the past 90 days, many parts of South Florida have been inundated again with between 150% and 200% of average rainfall totals, according to the weather service.Over on the Gulf coast, it's a different story. Drought has persisted for months. All or parts of 14 counties are under water use restrictions imposed by two water management districts that began last week and will remain in force until July, according to agency documents. This affects everything from lawn watering to golf courses to landscaping to agriculture.“All wasteful water use such as hosing down driveways and impervious surfaces, allowing water to flow unattended and using water in a grossly inefficient manner, is prohibited,” the Southwest Florida Water Management District website says.Violators can be fined varying amounts depending on the jurisdiction. In Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, fines range from $100 for an initial offense to $500 for repeated violations, although a warning is given first.One of the underground reservoirs Florida relies on, the Mid-Hawthorn Aquifer, is 15 feet (4.5 meters) lower this year compared with each of the past four years, according to the South Florida Water Management District. This is threatening supplies in wells in Cape Coral, which is just north of Fort Myers and is still recovering from last year's Hurricane Ian destruction.Many wells in the area were drilled to shallower depths in past years and now could dry out if the aquifer does not recover, Elsner said.“Today, they’re drilling those wells deeper because we’ve seen water level declines. So those shallower wells are most susceptible to drying out,” he said, noting that more than 100 permits for deeper replacement wells have been issued in Cape Coral during the past couple of years.Farmers have many methods to reduce water use. Practices include slow-drip irrigation, deep mulching and watering at night when there is less evaporation, Durica said.Even with all the water conservation efforts, Florida's west coast will need rain to truly ease the water shortage.Forecasters say it's likely Florida will experience heavier rainfall than usual over the typically drier winter months because of a weather phenomenon known as El Nino, which occurs when waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean grow warmer, impacting climate worldwide.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts a 55% chance of a strong El Niño this winter.“The hope is that with increased rainfall compared to normal this winter and spring, drought conditions would be alleviated,” Molleda said. “The latest drought outlook calls for a likely removal of drought conditions along the Florida Gulf coast sometime between December and February.”___",5475,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/drought-deluge-floridas-unusual-rainfall-totals-coast-105487168,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/38479489-9fe3-471b-93d2-65bfd3864dfe/wirestory_a4c23d088b6059beea2b70bf3e7907a4_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hillsborough climate lot spring increase depend condition rainstorm change november ocean record rainfall organic manner shallower interior hose replacement centimeter amount side mexico atmospheric half typical petersburg farm inch inefficient service easterly agency warn golf lash ian reduce strong compare happen tampa western deluge effort pattern address bureau system reality practice precipitation drought powerful start susceptible deal day storm course key wasteful level remain landscape april mulch niño total robert story depth begin increasingly accord coast impose drill dry pacific groundwater adapt foot oceanic late fin outlook miami eastern past persistently neighborhood experience reservoir board affected deficit supply gust set aquifer phenomenon prohibit west fell north bay underground cape unexpected driver locate website national flow heavier drier warmer year drilling weaker resident sat lawn single member result water typically december recharge usual meter weather impervious inundate alleviate surface nearby recover offense repeat durica threaten removal florida strength chance average jurisdiction range force hotter chief rain farmer city reading table july nino administration driveway expect dumped coral normal thunderstorm grossly wet peninsula winter vary boom county sweetwater mark marathon molleda conservation pressure month violation different part extreme bust season lead week southeast state permit atlantic low tropical southwest decline irrigation high method occurs temperature note focus affect deeper include grow evaporation document lighter impact give couple night lauderdale account management restriction myers issue initial office especially flood deep today hurricane fine east daily summer elsner unattended ease divide persist gulf hope south approach predicts wind rainy district fort community call area relies,0.023650000000000004,0.05479452054794521,10.674382470119522,0.4160849840395295,0
ABC,Suspect in UNLV shooting had more than 150 rounds of ammunition: Police,2023-12-07 23:10:00,"Meredith Deliso, Alex Stone, and Alyssa Starr","The suspect in Wednesday's deadly shooting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was armed with more than 150 rounds of ammunition and used a handgun he legally purchased last year, authorities said Thursday.The suspect -- a former college professor identified by Las Vegas police as Anthony Polito, 67 -- was killed in a shootout with responding officers about 10 minutes after shots were first reported at UNLV's Beam Hall, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a media briefing.The suspect, who was pronounced dead at the scene, had pulled up to the campus with 11 magazines, and nine loaded magazines were found on his person, McMahill said. It is unclear how many rounds were fired, McMahill said. The suspect had a Taurus 9 mm handgun that was legally purchased last year, the sheriff said.A motive remains under investigation. He is believed to have acted alone, McMahill said.The sheriff said he believes the suspect was heading to the nearby student union before he was confronted by officers outside Beam Hall.""I believe we averted a much larger tragedy by the actions of that heroic police officer,"" McMahill said.The suspect lived in Henderson, Nevada, and previously worked as an assistant professor at East Carolina University. He had applied for jobs with several institutions of higher education in Nevada and ""was denied each time,"" McMahill said.He had applied for a college professorship at UNLV, but was not hired, sources told ABC News.He was struggling financially and a notice of eviction was taped to his front door, McMahill said.Prior to the shooting rampage, the suspect visited a post office in Henderson and sent 22 letters to university personnel across the U.S. with no return address, according to McMahill. All of the people who were sent letters were identified and contacted, McMahill said.A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told ABC News authorities had all 22 envelopes in their possession, which they intercepted.Preliminary test results on the white powder in the first envelope opened have come back as being talcum powder, the source said, The authorities have to test every envelope with care and while following procedure, which will take time.While executing a search warrant at the suspect's home, authorities found a chair with an arrow pointing down to a document that was ""similar to a last will and testament,"" McMahill said.During the investigation, authorities also determined that Polito had a list of people ""he was seeking"" at UNLV and faculty from East Carolina University, McMahill said. None of the individuals listed on the target list were victims in the shooting, he said.""We have contacted almost everyone on those lists to make sure that they are all right,"" McMahill said.A law enforcement source told ABC News authorities think Polito spent a few minutes looking for people on the list, but was unsuccessful in finding them and then shot other victims who happened to be in the building.Investigators are looking into the suspect's past employment. They are also scrubbing the suspect's social media, devices and computers they seized, but right now there were no warning signs from friends or family prior to the incident, authorities said.Three people -- all staff members -- were killed in the shooting, authorities said. A fourth shooting victim -- a 38-year-old visiting professor -- remains hospitalized in life-threatening condition, McMahill said.Two of the deceased victims were identified by authorities Thursday: Cha Jan Chang, 64, who was known as ""Jerry,"" was a UNLV business professor, and Patricia Navarro Velez, 39, was an assistant professor in accounting at UNLV.",3707,https://abcnews.go.com/US/suspect-unlv-shooting-150-rounds-ammunition/story?id=105478841,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a61ebd77-f507-4bd8-bf2e-35ea85a82ed6/las-vegas-shooting-ap-jt-231207_1701988557736_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police victim cha employment pronounce decease metropolitan visit respond person social condition nearby confront investigation arrow back minute return patricia kill pull fire rampage hospitalize remains make henderson handgun purchase college large professor talcum testament hire hall warn similar financially happen family campus seize believe unlv enforcement work procedure jan friend address education open institution motive chair determine job front struggle vega assistant law abc kevin find chang told incident fourth suspect taurus powder wednesday medium seek mm union knowledge identify faculty legally department high professorship head staff accounting ammunition deny contact accord prior live scrub past document taped mcmahill point previously personnel device possession individual sheriff student avert jerry navarro shootout deadly university nevada tragedy notice home sign scene load action time thursday polito carolina round office test authority unsuccessful shot news envelope execute target velez computer apply letter unclear eviction former search east year heroic shoot list spent arm warrant dead source post magazine white follow anthony beam act member business report result found officer,-0.9854,0.32371189641219317,11.336516516516514,0.23984341484341481,0

ABC,Adele praises influential women after being honored at THR's Women in Entertainment gala,2023-12-07 21:51:00,JONATHAN LANDRUM JR. AP entertainment writer,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Adele paid homage to the many women -- including her mother, grandmother and aunts — who helped shape her world and personality since she was a child.The superstar singer then praised actor Kerry Washington and found herself in awe while in the presence of singer Dua Lipa after she received the prestigious Sherry Lansing Leadership Award at The Hollywood Reporter's Women in Entertainment breakfast gala Thursday. She was handed the award by Helen Mirren for excelling as a trailblazer and her philanthropy work in Hollywood.“You are the absolute epitome of what it is to open doors and more importantly leave them open,” said Adele of Lansing, the first female to head a Hollywood studio. The singer has been a supporter of the LGBTQ and women rights, and associated with an organization that helps provide clean water to countries in need.Mirren, an Oscar winner, applauded Adele for her musical prowess. The actor said she felt a “shiver” down her back when she listened to the singer's debut single “Hometown Glory.”“That chill comes just a few times in your life when you realize you are listening to a brilliant and game-changing new artist,” Mirren said of Adele, a 16-time Grammy winner who also has collected an Oscar and Emmy during her lauded career. “I thought, ‘Wow, a goddess walks amongst us.’ ”Adele's shoot-from-the-hip speech, which involved several F-bombs, drew laughter and applause from the audience. She said the women in her family molded her into the person she is today through their boisterous and strong personas.“They are a force to be reckoned with and quite frankly terrifying. But that was because they had to be,” the singer said. “They had to learn the hard way what it is to be a woman. In turn, they hardened. Their character was their armor. But thanks to them, my character is my skin.”Previous honorees include Oprah Winfrey, Meryl Streep, Viola Davis, Reese Witherspoon, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston and Barbra Streisand.In her speech, Adele expressed her gratitude toward Kerry Washington, who was earlier honored with the Equity in Entertainment Award, which recognized her for amplifying the voices of underrepresented communities in the entertainment industry.Actor Ariana DeBose, who presented Washington with the award, admired how the “Scandal” actor “squashed the traditional stereotype” of being a Black woman in Hollywood.“Every component of the career that (Washington) built, the empire that she has created speaks to equity,” said DeBose, who starred in the “West Side Story."" “How has she done that? By being herself and taking up space.”Earlier, Will Ferrell lobbied for Washington to run for president.“Please?

ABC,NBA In-Season Tournament not lacking in the Las Vegas glitz and glamour,2023-12-07 21:40:00,MARK ANDERSON AP sports writer,"LAS VEGAS -- When league officials decided to play the semifinals and championship game of the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament in Las Vegas, they knew it wouldn't be an understated affair.And it hasn't been.Though the semifinals Thursday count in the standings and half a million dollars is on the line for the players who win the final, the tournament has the combination of an exhibition All-Star Game feel to a playoff atmosphere intensity not often seen before Christmas.Nelly and TLC set the tone by performing at Toshiba Plaza, where fans congregate outside T-Mobile Arena before entering the building.Inside the arena were Julius Erving, Gary Payton, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Vivica A. Fox. The two-time WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces also were in attendance.There was a red-carpet entry for LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo and other top players. They played on a red-and-blue court.“Just all of the different things that they have made of it, and you get to be a part of it and you’re like, man, this is pretty special,” Bucks All-Star guard Damian Lillard said. “I think the atmosphere was what it was. When I played USAB, that’s kind of how I felt, just like the energy in the building felt like USA Basketball in the summer because the crowd was just so neutral. But it was a good experience.”NBA Commissioner Adam Silver watched the action, and he will give a state-of-the-league news conference before Saturday's final. He no doubt will be asked about Las Vegas as a potential candidate for expansion, and Silver has said the city already is treated like the 31st franchise with each team playing in the Summer League here.“This is like the worst-kept secret in the world, isn’t it, that this is eventually going to be an NBA city?” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “We’ve been coming here for so many years for Summer League. ... I think the turnout today shows that there’s certainly interest in the NBA game. I believe that the NBA can make just about anything happen. The In-Season Tournament is something that there were many, many skeptics about for many years, and right now it’s all the buzz.”NBA broadcast partners ESPN and TNT did the usually unthinkable, with one broadcasting one semifinal and the other network handling the other one. They even had dueling pre-game shows, with Charles Barkley of TNT's popular “Inside the NBA” taking a shot at the ESPN's vocal Stephen A. Smith by telling him not to come over to his set.“This ain't ‘First Take,’” Barkley told a laughing Smith. “This going to be the first (butt)-whooping you take.”For all the glitz and glamour, the semifinals got off to a solemn start. A moment of silence for the victims of Wednesday's mass shooting at UNLV took place before both semis. Three people were killed and a fourth seriously injured.___",2800,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/nba-season-tournament-lacking-las-vegas-glitz-glamour-105484161,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/38cd19d4-a350-42de-a695-23222c8af8dc/wirestory_186eea4d0c6cdba133fd7a588cd9acdc_16x9.jpg?w=992,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,inside player interest victim enter basketball combination dollar glitz top solemn win line charles kill lillard neutral mass doubt make kind espn special ace half city tournament expansion barkley network perform popular carlisle guard payton secret smith moment lebron stephen broadcast happen erving semifinal floyd glamour believe inaugural unlv damian handle vega start different playoff part told atmosphere building skeptic duel fourth wnba conference game place fox championship saturday tlc standing wednesday antetokounmpo pretty feel usa entry silence partner vocal decide rick coach mayweather champion giannis league energy potential laugh congregate pacer toshiba arena exhibition vivica crowd unthinkable gary usab give played world commissioner julius set james turnout adam million thursday understated nba action team intensity play candidate final today news shot show count knew tone watch summer year treat butt shoot eventually franchise plaza semi silver buck felt tnt official broadcasting,0.982,0.2142857142857143,7.957549549549547,0.5167748917748919,0

""... Duke University is an elite institution in every facet, and we are excited to be a part of it. I'm beyond excited to get to work.""Duke, which conducted finalist interviews in Las Vegas this week, has scheduled an introductory news conference for Saturday.Diaz is coming off a season in which he led the nation's top statistical defense, as the Nittany Lions held opponents to 223.2 yards per game -- the best single-season defensive performance in the sport since Alabama in 2011.He also brings head-coaching experience in the ACC, as he led Miami to three bowl-eligible seasons during his time there from 2019 to 2021.Diaz, whose 2020 Miami teami was ranked as high as No. 7 in the country, was fired after three seasons with a 21-15 record. Miami is 12-12 since his departure.He will take over a Duke program that got an energy jolt during Mike Elko's two seasons as coach. Elko went 9-4 in 2022 and led the Blue Devils to the school's highest national ranking, No. 16, this year. He left last month for the head-coaching job at Texas A&M.""As our process unfolded, it became abundantly clear that Manny Diaz is the right fit for Duke University,"" athletic director Nina King said in a statement. ""Manny's previous experiences have prepared him for this opportunity, and he is, quite simply, an outstanding football coach who will capitalize on the positive momentum of this program.""An elite communicator and collaborator, Manny possesses the dynamic ability to cultivate impactful relationships with internal and external constituents surrounding a successful football program. As Duke's head football coach, I am confident that Manny will lead the young men in our program to reach and surpass their aspirations of achievement both on and off the field.""Diaz will need to work quickly to retool Duke's roster, which was laden with veterans -- the team is expected to lose well over half of its starters to graduation. Star quarterback Riley Leonard is in the NCAA transfer portal and took a visit to Notre Dame this week.Diaz brings extensive experience in the ACC. In addition to his time at Miami as head coach and defensive coordinator, he has also had stops at Florida State as a graduate assistant and at NC State in various roles for six seasons early in his career.After his departure from Miami, Diaz made quick work of building Penn State into a defensive power. The Nittany Lions have held opponents to 24 or less points in 17 straight games -- the nation's longest active streak.Diaz was a semifinalist for the Broyles Award, given to the nation's top assistant, in his first season at Penn State.

ABC,The UN secretary-general invoked 'Article 99' to push for a Gaza cease-fire. What exactly is it?,2023-12-07 20:53:00,The Associated Press,"It's called “Article 99.” And it hasn't been used for decades. Until this week.With an intensifying Israeli offensive and escalating civilian casualties, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres invoked a rarely exercised power this week to warn the Security Council of an impending “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza. He urged members to demand an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.Guterres invoked Article 99 of the U.N. Charter — last used over half a century ago — which says the secretary-general may inform the council of matters he believes threaten international peace and security.Here, Edith M. Lederer, longtime chief U.N. correspondent for The Associated Press, breaks down what this could mean.It's a provision of the United Nations Charter, the U.N. constitution. It states that the secretary-general — the U.N.'s top diplomat — may bring to the attention of the Security Council “any matter which, in his opinion, may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security.”This gives an important additional power to the secretary-general, since the real power at the U.N. is held by its 193 member nations and especially the 15 countries that serve on the Security Council.Article 99 is extremely rarely used. The last time it was invoked was during fighting in 1971 that led to the creation of Bangladesh and its separation from Pakistan.Guterres invoked Article 99 because he sees the situation in Gaza at risk of a “complete collapse” of the territory's humanitarian system and civil order. It was something he felt needed to be done.Arab and Islamic nations followed up on Guterres's letter immediately.The United Arab Emirates, the Arab representative on the Security Council, circulated a short resolution to Security Council members late Wednesday calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. They plan to put that resolution to a vote at a Security Council meeting on Friday morning.The United States, which is Israel’s closest ally and has veto power on resolutions, has not supported a cease-fire. On Tuesday, U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood said that the role of the Security Council in the Israel-Gaza war is not to get in the way of important diplomacy that’s taking place. And he said the Security Council resolution at this time ""would not be useful.""This could signal a likely veto, but the U.S. has not said either way.Because Guterres believes that the humanitarian system and the humanitarian operations in Gaza are collapsing.He also warns in his letter that in the current situation, “amid constant bombardment by the Israeli Defense Forces and without shelter or essentials to survive, I expect public order to completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions, rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible.”Guterres said the situation could get even worse, pointing to possible epidemics and the mass displacement of Palestinians into neighboring countries. He sees a looming disaster.Previous secretaries-general have brought threats that they saw to international peace and security to the Security Council without mentioning Article 99. This includes Congo in 1960, the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran that began in November 1979, the Iran-Iraq war in 1980 and more recently Myanmar in 2017.",3264,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/secretary-general-invoked-article-99-push-gaza-ceasefire-105483723,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/fde99859-c4c9-4c2b-907c-6ec6dfaf258a/wirestory_334858e6a3eee7a71e050a6ea03de635_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country maintenance desperate wood shelter condition november associate top short charter opinion complete defense closest intensify threaten public iran threat urge mass force creation chief ally half possible correspondent century expect lederer crisis warn power ceasefire impend plan constant united hostage diplomacy situation believe diplomat deputy israel recently neighbor support system tuesday article matter humanitarian mention put offensive amid decade arab signal rarely islamic demand congo lead week bangladesh state antonio risk serve place wednesday robert representative bombardment begin invoked due guterres vote casualty include nation late role myanmar important council gaza survive real point attention give meeting current constitution break loom operation displacement render circulate time order exercise collapse completely brought international additional warns limited especially veto israeli peace ago letter escalate catastrophe fight essential press immediate friday bring civil separation emirate provision edith palestinian follow epidemic member held ambassador resolution security inform longtime call territory felt extremely civilian assistance,-0.8536,0.5514705882352942,12.587714285714288,0.4639260912698413,0
ABC,"Hong Kong's new election law thins the candidate pool, giving voters little option in Sunday's polls",2023-12-07 20:36:00,KANIS LEUNG Associated Press,"HONG KONG -- One of the Hong Kong's longest-serving pro-democracy council members is organizing a farewell party with her residents in late December. Another democratic council member isn't running for reelection to the post that has come to define him in recent years.As more obstacles are placed in front of candidates, the pool is thinning and becoming less politically diverse, leaving mostly “patriots,” those loyal to mainland China, in the running. And with such slim options, some voters say they won’t participate.Sunday’s district council elections will be absent of pro-democracy candidates for the first time in about four decades. Some of them chose to opt out, while others were unable to gather the requisite nominations to qualify — a hurdle that proved difficult to clear even for some pro-government politicians.During her 38-year tenure, Winnie Poon made history as the first popularly elected female council member in Kwun Tong district and witnessed the councils become more democratic. She said she's stepping down because of her age, but also because she's “uninterested in playing this game” anymore, envisioning a future where councilors, who primarily handle municipal matters such as organizing construction projects and public facilities, instead serve to back the city government’s ideas.“After a long journey, I realized, ‘Oh, there’s another starting point,'” she said. “It’s even further back than where I originally started.”Jay Li, one of Hong Kong ’s remaining pro-democracy district councilors, decided not seek reelection this year after the government’s electoral overhaul.At the height of the pro-democracy protests in 2019, Li and his colleagues rode a wave of anti-government sentiment to a landslide victory in the municipal-level elections. Representing residents of Sham Shui Po, one of Hong Kong’s poorest districts, Li's commitment was to improve the community through a bottom-up approach.But for Li, the new election rules raise the cost of running and undermine the legitimacy of elections.An amendment passed in July eliminates most directly elected seats on local district councils, the last major political representative bodies mostly chosen by the public, from some 90% to about 20% — a level even lower than when these bodies were first introduced in the 1980s under British rule. It also requires candidates to secure endorsements from at least nine members of government-appointed committees that are mostly packed with Beijing loyalists, making it virtually impossible for their pro-democracy rivals to run.“It’s going backward. How much effort will it take to get back to where we were?” he said. “My heart is very tired.”The lack of diversity in Hong Kong’s grassroots politics is widely seen as a result of the government’s crackdown on the pro-democracy movement following the 2019 protests — the most concerted challenge to Beijing since the former British colony returned to China’s rule in 1997. China had promised the territory could retain its civil, economic and political liberties for 50 years under the “one country, two systems” framework. But in recent years, the Hong Kong government has severely limited rights to free speech and assembly and virtually eliminated political opposition under the rubric of maintaining national security.The pro-democracy camp’s stunning win in the last elections four years ago was a clear rebuke to the government’s handling of the 2019 protests.Yet Li's party, the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People’s Livelihood, which is famous for its dedication to serving low-income residents, was unable to field any candidates for the first time since its founding in 1986.Kwok Wai-shing, Li’s colleague who intended to run, tried to secure nominations by emailing all local committee members — calling some of them and even contacting multiple members through the networks of his senior colleagues. But the effort failed, with some of them simply saying it was “inconvenient for them to reply,” Kwok said.""The committee members may not solely consider one’s abilities and experience, or whether they love Hong Kong and China,"" he said.Pro-Beijing lawmaker Michael Tien's political group also faced difficulties in securing nominations.In October, Tien told reporters that four members in his group tried to visit about 240 nominators, but 200 of them did not answer the door and 15 others refused to listen to their platform. Only one member of his group obtained sufficient endorsements to run.“When some committee members and chairpersons have political affiliation, this is very unfavorable to other groups like us that do not have many people who are also committee members,"" he told The Associated Press. “There’s no chance to introduce ourselves.""About 70% of the hopefuls running for a seat in the geographical constituencies sit on one of the three committees that are responsible for endorsing candidates, according to a count by the AP.The polls have become “small-circle” elections, said John Burns, an honorary professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong. The exclusion of all but official patriots reflects the government’s preference for obedient councils, Burns said. The new councils would be unlikely to reflect the city's diverse opinions, he said, undermining their crucial role as a bridge connecting the government to the community.“They become official patriots reflecting other official patriots’ opinions,"" he said.But the Home Affairs Department insisted the new nomination rule is reasonable, citing a court dismissal of a judicial review against the requirement on Dec. 1.Judge Russell Coleman ruled that there was insufficient evidence to suggest the pro-democracy camp’s failures to secure enough nominations were due to unfairness in the new rule.The department says the requirement helped ensure the candidates are recognized by those who are familiar with district affairs.Chris Ip, a pro-Beijing politician trying to make a comeback to the council after losing in 2019, said it’s impossible for those who worked in the district for a long period not to know any of the committee members. Ip, who sits on one of the committees, said after the overhaul, candidates put a stronger emphasis on their platforms and councilors are better able to focus on their constituents' livelihoods.Some pro-democracy voters aren't buying it, and plan to turn their backs on the election. When Chow Tak-wing, a supporter of Kwok, learned that Kwok could not join the race, he decided not to vote too.But Hong Kong leader John Lee and other officials are repeatedly appealing to the public to vote, determined to boost the turnout rate. The government planned various promotional activities, including game booths, an outdoor concert and offers of free visits to some museums. Advertisements were posted across subway stations. The city's prominent airline Cathay Pacific Airways also offered discount airfare for passengers traveling back from mainland China to Hong Kong, saying its aim is to help residents “actively participate” in the polls.While the government is working to spotlight the elections, council members like Poon and Li are preparing for their exits under the sharply shifting political landscape.Without council seats, his party would have even fewer resources to sustain its operations, Li said.",7377,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/hong-kongs-new-election-law-thins-candidate-pool-105483453,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/303ba9d4-045b-482c-8d3d-c2c8e67308ca/wirestory_546a33a54ca9a5317e3bd7fa5f17a54b_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country chosen raise spotlight shui dedication affiliation kwok opinion back return insist opt sham win public intend airfare seat promise requirement patriot improve facility suggest major long bridge lose crucial economic severely free requisite popularly body appeal define qualify project tenure strong senior nomination rule leave effort china electoral female aim uninterested hong handle preference offer exclusion system politics eliminates difficult diversity constituent front represent maintain matter slim email start put virtually review overhaul sharply endorse responsible nominator crackdown poorest told decade democratic unable cost level anymore multiple remain learn loyal actively councilors solely poll game rebuke inconvenient travel resource chairperson journey landslide colleague retain mainland coleman repeatedly department thin realize station reporter consider local evidence framework contact accord due livelihood john diverse grassroots pacific platform originally witness chose late reelection listen role political experience history construction october concert answer turnout museum operation home university sits prepare airline commitment constituency play municipal candidate limited simply envision promotional tien ago turn require national obtain period former press opposition emphasis civil absent field affair year lack connect resident boost stun supporter step post michael dismissal follow burn kong member result found december clear famous amendment introduce passenger sufficient official leader reflect chow visit rate judicial difficulty hurdle speech associate obedient kwun politician chance russell party lee make camp voter sentiment fail court booth city victory july administration professor organize network rode instead ip winnie obstacle plan refuse recent unfavorable eliminate secure work option liberty movement directly rubric determine loyalist geographical lawmaker comeback discount group failure cathay pool love rival participate heart serve place join jay shift seek wave low outdoor elect ability reply challenge democracy legitimacy sustain representative decide focus honorary vote future include activity endorsement run primarily council point government recognize association backward protest insufficient prove impossible ensure packed widely time race familiar colony unfairness airway beijing poon buying prominent exit reasonable tong count hopeful undermine farewell election age subway district gather assembly height community politically territory pass british call advertisement committee,0.99125,0.0,11.53523520485584,0.41121579430670346,0
ABC,Deals & Steals on gifts galore!,2023-12-07 20:36:00,"Becky Worley , Tenzin Shakya, Aude Soichet, Ariane Nalty, and Mason Leib","The bill would require social media companies to provide parental access to data about children’s potentially dangerous social media interactions.Berman said that advocating for Sammy’s Law helps her feel a small sense of justice in the death of her son, Sammy, who was a high school junior when he died in 2021.""There can't be justice for our 16-year-old child being murdered. There is no justice that will make that OK,"" Berman told ABC News’ Becky Worley in an interview that aired Tuesday. ""If we could change the laws, or we could somehow convince social media to do the right thing, then … I will feel the closest thing to justice that I probably can feel.""In 2021, the Santa Monica Police Department told ABC News in a statement, ""a preliminary investigation leads us to believe prescription drug use may have been involved."" The police department did not comment on the role social media allegedly played in Sammy's death.At a press conference Tuesday in Washington, D.C., announcing the bill, Berman doubled down on the need for this type of legislation.""I had no idea that drug dealers were reaching out to my son, accessing my son and connecting with my son through Snapchat,"" Berman said Tuesday. ""We're doing this to save other children from Sammy's fate and to save other families from the devastation that we have to live with every day.""The bill would call for social media companies to allow third-party software to monitor children’s social media accounts and flag concerning behavior to parents.""It would require any social media platform with children on it to allow for parent monitoring software integration from the outside, not just their own, it has to be across devices and across platforms,"" said Chapman.The proposed law is in the initial stages of the legislative process and will still need to be voted on by both chambers of Congress and signed into law before enacted.The bill was introduced to the House of Representatives by Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and co-sponsored by fellow Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier, and two Republicans: Rep. Earl “Buddy” Carter and Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks.""The very technology that we have in our homes and our pockets today may be part of the problem. But with this bill, we're trying to bring these devices in as part of the solution. And I'm proud to be part of that bipartisan solution,"" said Wasserman Schultz at the introductory press conference.The new legislation, if passed, would aim to bridge the gap between parents and their children’s social media use.""This legislation would create a parental right to know about dangerous or concerning interactions children under the age of 17 may have online. Social media companies would be required to provide access to data pertaining to a parent’s child through registered third-party safety apps,"" read a press release from the bill’s sponsors.In addition to advocating for change in Congress, Berman, Chapman and dozens of other parents are also part of a lawsuit against Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, alleging the social media platform enables drug dealers to reach minors and young adults.In 2021, Snapchat told ""GMA"" in a statement that its ""deepest sympathies"" are with the family and friends of Berman's son and the company is ""heartbroken by his passing.""The statement also said Snapchat was ""committed to working together with law enforcement in this case and in all instances where Snapchat is used for illegal purposes.""""We have no higher priority than keeping Snapchat a safe environment and we will continue to invest in protecting our community,"" the statement concluded.When asked about the litigation, Jennifer Park Stout, head of global public policy at Snap, Inc., said, ""My heart goes out to those families and to any family that has suffered really what is an unimaginable loss. We've deployed technologies and tools and created new products that we think will really be effective in combating this problem.""Park Stout demonstrated for Worley a feature that Snapchat has in place to combat drug sales on the platform, including a portal that redirects drug searches to informational content on drug use.""This is a devastating crisis and it's happened really underneath our noses, and we are doing everything we can to really wrap our arms around this problem in such a meaningful way.""As part of the ongoing effort, Snapchat has partnered with Ed and Mary Ternan, who lost their son Charlie to fentanyl poisoning in 2020 after he purchased a fentanyl-laced pill on Snapchat, to educate teens about illegal pill sales through the Ternan's foundation, Song For Charlie.Ed Ternan joined Snap Inc’s Safety Advisory Board, which according to their website, works with 15 safety-focused nonprofits ""combating significant online safety risks.""They couple are also working on a congressional effort to make educational information about fake pills available to schools nationwide.""This new problem requires new approaches. And we can't do more of the same old stuff that we've tried for decades that just hasn't worked,"" Ed Ternan said. ""That’s the little bit of hope that keeps us going.""""Families like Song for Charlie and Ed and Mary Ternan have been critical to our understanding, and to developing and trying to get a step ahead of what the problem is,"" said Park Stout.",5336,https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/family/story/dr-laura-berman-husband-speak-introduction-sammys-law-105440096,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police wasserman behavior available dozen advisory change investigation ongoing informational continue public earl sammy addition critical portal develop preliminary ahead monitor bridge lose illegal nonprofit type dealer interview happen chapman content enforcement carter effort aim fake company unimaginable sympathy law schultz allege day abc gap nationwide told decade democratic debbie fate prescription release congressional legislative child monica school reach bill medium global department head partner devastate schrier accord information live platform probably introductory fentanyl role small technology stage board pill pertain significant legislation suffer home apps sign charlie republican idea proud congress bit advocate litigation young require enables website safety register search buddy press bring connect understand loss step meaningful passing introduce integration social double snap case justice dangerous closest berman foundation make redirects educate purchase policy nose santa demonstrate flag interaction concern crisis air snapchat feature heartbroken access online worley family safe commit effective believe pocket software work convince allegedly friend fellow tuesday devastation ternan part environment data comment park death purpose stout chamber song lead conference risk priority heart place join gma wrap underneath combat save feel high representative parent vote process protect include educational becky jennifer minor tool couple played murder device account solution parental deepest announce involve bipartisan junior mary statement washington invest house initial today instance news potentially provide problem propose poison stuff create deployed arm hope age monitoring approach mariannette product read community call pass lawsuit,-0.952,0.2811094452773613,9.45007843137255,0.399586296639868,0

They come after the implosion of a plea deal over the summer that would have spared him jail time, putting the case on track to a possible trial as his father campaigns for reelection.Hunter Biden “spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills,” special counsel David Weiss said in a statement. The charges are centered on at least $1.4 million in taxes Hunter Biden owed during between 2016 and 2019, a period where he has acknowledged struggling with addiction. The back taxes have since been paid.If convicted, Hunter Biden, 53, could a maximum of 17 years in prison. The special counsel probe remains open, Weiss said.In a fiery response, defense attorney Abbe Lowell accused Weiss of “bowing to Republican pressure"" in the case.“Based on the facts and the law, if Hunter’s last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought,"" Lowell said in a statement.The White House declined to comment on Thursday’s indictment, referring questions to the Justice Department or Hunter Biden’s personal representatives.The charging documents filed in California, where he lives, details spending on everything from drugs and strippers to luxury hotels and exotic cars, “in short, everything but his taxes,"" prosecutor Leo Wise wrote.The indictment comes as congressional Republicans pursue an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, claiming he was engaged in an influence-peddling scheme with his son. The House is expected to vote next week on formally authorizing the inquiry.No evidence has emerged so far to prove that Joe Biden, in his current or previous office, abused his role or accepted bribes, though questions have arisen about the ethics surrounding the Biden family’s international business.The separate, long-running criminal investigation into Hunter Biden had been expected to wind down with a plea deal where he would have gotten two years' probation after pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax charges and avoided prosecution on the gun charge if he stayed out of trouble.The agreement was pilloried as a “sweetheart deal” by Republicans, including former President Donald Trump. He is facing his own criminal cases, including charges that he plotted to overturn the results of the 2020 election.Rep.

ABC,Duke hires Penn State DC and ex-Miami coach Manny Diaz to lead Blue Devils,2023-12-07 20:22:00,RALPH D. RUSSO AP college football writer,"Duke hired Penn State defensive coordinator Manny Diaz as its head coach on Thursday night.The school announced Diaz's hiring in a news release and is finalizing plans for a news conference Saturday to introduce Diaz as the replacement to Mike Elko, who was hired by Texas A&M.The move marks a return for the 49-year-old Diaz to the Atlantic Coast Conference as well as to the state of North Carolina. In addition to three seasons as Miami's coach, he spent six seasons on Chuck Amato's staff from 2000-05 at North Carolina State, about 20 miles from Duke's campus in Durham.The Blue Devils followed their successful recent formula by hiring a defensive-minded coach with little head coaching experience. Elko thrived as a former coordinator and first-time head coach.In a statement, athletic director Nina King called Diaz “the right fit” and an “elite communicator and collaborator.”Diaz went 21-15 with Miami from 2019-21 while reaching two bowl games in his only head-coaching stint. He also went 16-9 in ACC play, but the school fired him on the same day it hired current coach Mario Cristobal in an attempt to hasten a return to the national elite.Diaz has spent the last two seasons with the Nittany Lions both as coordinator and linebackers coach. His defense finished in the top 20 of the FBS rankings in total and scoring defense in 2022, and stands at No. 1 in total defense (223.3 yards) and No. 3 in scoring defense (11.4) this season as Penn State (10-2) prepares to face Ole Miss in the Peach Bowl.Diaz also had stops as defensive coordinator at Miami, Mississippi State, Louisiana Tech, Texas and Middle Tennessee.Elko's departure after 16 wins in two seasons marked an unusually short coaching tenure in Durham.The last time a Duke coach stayed three or fewer seasons came when Steve Spurrier left for Florida after a 1987-89 run that included the program’s last ACC title in his final season. Elko and Spurrier are the only Duke coaches to stay three or fewer years since 1925, spanning the Blue Devils’ time in the Southern Conference before becoming a charter ACC member in 1953.Elko won nine games and a bowl in his debut season, then guided Duke to a seven-win regular season with a weekend win against Pittsburgh. This year’s team opened with a rout of preseason ACC favorite Clemson, cracked the AP Top 25 amid a 4-0 start and even hosted ESPN’s “College GameDay” for the first time in football — after multiple visits for the storied men’s basketball program — ahead of a ranked-vs-ranked matchup against Notre Dame.King had said the school would move swiftly in finding Elko’s replacement as it had done before. The school needed 12 days to hire Elko after David Cutcliffe’s exit, then needed 10 days before hiring Diaz.The challenge for Diaz will be to hire a staff and stabilize the program amid the transfer-portal churn.The clock is already ticking on departures as NCAA rules permit players to enter the transfer portal for 30 days after a coaching change, allowing them to explore moves elsewhere. That list includes starting quarterback Riley Leonard. The portal window opened Monday for teams to seek out help from other schools.Duke (7-5) is set to face Troy in the Birmingham Bowl on Dec. 23.This marks the third hire for one of the school's marquee programs in King's nearly three years as athletic director, following Elko’s arrival and Jon Scheyer’s ascension as the designated successor to Mike Krzyzewski when the Hall of Fame basketball coach retired in 2022.___AP Sports Writer Aaron Beard contributed to this report.___Get alerts on the latest AP Top 25 poll throughout the season.

ABC,Trump's vow to only be a dictator on 'day one' follows growing worry over his authoritarian rhetoric,2023-12-07 19:58:00,JILL COLVIN Associated Press and BILL BARROW Associated Press,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- As Donald Trump faces growing scrutiny over his increasingly authoritarian and violent rhetoric, Fox News host Sean Hannity gave his longtime friend a chance to assure the American people that he wouldn't abuse power or seek retribution if he wins a second term.But instead of offering a perfunctory answer brushing off the warnings, Trump stoked the fire.“Except for day one,” the GOP front-runner said Tuesday night before a live audience in Davenport, Iowa. “I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill.""And in case anyone missed it, he reenacted the exchange.“We love this guy,” Trump said of Hannity. “He says, ‘You’re not going to be a dictator, are you?’ I said: ‘No, no, no, other than day one. We’re closing the border, and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator.’”Trump has a long history of making inflammatory proclamations that spark outrage from detractors and generate a stream of headlines, without ever coming to fruition. Often they are made in a tongue-in-cheek manner that allows Trump's allies to claim he was joking and cite the backlash as another example of a candidate skilled at baiting an out-of-touch press that takes him far too literally.Trump campaign aides said Thursday that the former president was simply trying to trigger the left and the media with his dictator comment, while also seeking to focus attention on the influx of migrants at the border and stubborn inflation, two vulnerabilities for President Joe Biden heading into the 2024 general election.But the consequences of Trump's rhetoric have been made all too clear, after he refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and a mob of his supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of Biden's victory.The former president, who has long expressed regard for authoritarian leaders and the power they wield, is now vowing vengeance and retribution as he outlines a second-term agenda marked by an unprecedented expansion of executive power, unparalleled interference in the justice system, and a massive purge of civil servants.Indeed, hours before his remarks were aired, a longtime ally who is widely expected to serve in a top national security role if Trump returns to the White House vowed to target journalists in a second Trump term.“We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” said Kash Patel, even though numerous federal and local officials, a long list of courts, top former campaign staffers and even Trump's own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of the fraud he alleges.Biden and other critics have seized on Trump’s comments, painting him as a threat to democracy as they seek to turn the 2024 election into another referendum on the former president instead of Biden. Cognizant of the risks, Trump's campaign has tried to distance itself from Patel’s statement as well as headline-grabbing policy plans proposed by several outside groups staffed by longtime Trump allies, with top aides issuing a statement last month saying the groups did not speak for the campaign.Trump, too, has tried to turn the tables on Biden, who has increasingly argued the former president poses a fundamental danger to the country. In a speech in Iowa this month, Trump insisted it is really Biden who is the true “destroyer” of democracy, citing the four criminal indictments he is facing as politically motivated efforts to damage his campaign.It's an argument Trump and his campaign plan to continue to make heading into the 2024 general election.The Biden campaign's attack, said Trump senior adviser Jason Miller, “is a clear sign that the Democrats believe their only possible pathway to victory is to go scorched earth on President Trump.""Despite Democrats' attempts “to make outlandish statements about what a future Trump term could look like,” Miller said, there is now a reference point: ""Four years of President Trump in the White House, and he never did any of the types of things that Joe Biden is currently doing to him.”But Trump's own words are clear.“In 2016, I declared I am your voice. Today, I add, I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,"" he said in March 2023.In the months since, Trump has repeatedly and explicitly vowed to use the Justice Department to target his enemies in a dramatic break from the long-standing, post-Watergate tradition of independence.“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, the entire Biden crime family, and all others involved with the destruction of our elections, borders and our country itself,"" he said in a June video.In an interview with Univision, he went even further. “If I happen to be president and I see somebody who’s doing well and beating me very badly, I say, ‘Go down and indict them,'"" he said.Last December, he mused about circumventing the Constitution, arguing that the election fraud he alleges ""allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.”He has taken an especially hostile approach to the press, vowing to “rout the fake news media,"" calling reporters ""THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"" and saying outlets like NBC News and MSNBC should be investigated for treason.Trump's extensive policy plans also rely on a dramatic expansion of executive power. He wants to strip tens of thousands of career federal workers of their civil service protections, has vowed new ideological tests for those entering the country and has talked about increasing the military's role on domestic soil, including sending the National Guard to the border and to cities like Chicago to tackle crime.He has warned that the gravest threats to the nation come “not from abroad, but from within,"" has called for expanded use of the death penalty while praising countries that rely on “quick” trials and extrajudicial killings, and has said looters should be shot.He has continued to praise authoritarian leaders like China's Xi Jinping, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, while dehumanizing his enemies as “scum” and “thugs” who “live like vermin.""Aides argue the former president did not enact some of his most extreme campaign promises, like jailing his then-rival Hillary Clinton or enacting “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" though he did try to ban foreign nationals from a handful of Muslim-majority countries. They note his campaign operation this time around has been widely praised as more disciplined and professional than his previous efforts — a sign of what could be to come.But if he wins again, Trump is expected to face far fewer guardrails, including an administration filled with loyalists now experienced in wielding federal power, fewer rivals in Congress and more appointees across the courts.Quentin Fulks, the No. 2 official on Biden’s reelection campaign, pushed back at Trump’s attempts to turn the issue back on Biden and said there is no comparison between the men. Biden, he said, is not standing at the presidential podium “saying that he’s going to round up his political enemies or use the government to go after his political enemies.”He said it was imperative for Democrats to ""call out this rhetoric when we see it and make sure the American people really know what’s at stake.”Meanwhile, Ken Cuccinelli, a top immigration official in Trump’s administration who now leads a super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president, called the former president’s dictator remarks “provocative” and vintage Trump.“Do I think he’s trying to needle everybody? Yes, I do. He enjoys doing that,"" Cuccinelli said. ""Does it help improve America? No, it doesn’t.

ABC,Privacy concerns persist in transgender sports case after Utah judge seals only some health records,2023-12-07 19:53:00,HANNAH SCHOENBAUM Associated Press,"SALT LAKE CITY -- Transgender teenagers who are challenging a Utah law banning trans girls from playing on girls' sports teams can keep portions of their mental health records confidential after a state judge ruled Thursday that some details are irrelevant to the case.Two student-athletes whose families sued over the 2022 state law were ordered in September by Judge Keith Kelly to give state attorneys access to the last seven years of their mental health records, as well as all documents related to medical transition and puberty.Kelly temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the ban, which took effect last year after the Republican-controlled Legislature overrode Gov. Spencer Cox’s veto, while the court continues to assess its legality.Cox drew national attention as one of the few Republican governors who pushed back against state lawmakers’ restrictions on transgender youth, warning that such bans target kids already at a high risk for suicide. Utah is one of more than a dozen states that have passed such bans.Kelly ruled last August that transgender girls could return to athletic competition after hearing several hours of student testimony describing how exclusion from sports was causing them significant distress. He described the ban as “plainly unfavorable treatment” and said it must be put on pause to protect the girls from “irreparable harm” and a severe impact on their mental health.But because the girls' “physical, mental and emotional circumstances” factored into his decision to grant the preliminary injunction, he also determined that their mental health records were relevant to the case.His ruling Thursday does little to alleviate privacy concerns raised by the plaintiffs' attorneys, who argue the state should not have access to the deeply personal mental health records of children who have not waived their therapist-client privilege.Only details concerning irrelevant third parties, certain isolated events and the students' deadnames, or the birth names that they no longer use, will remain redacted, Kelly said Thursday.“These children should have the ability to speak freely in their therapy sessions without an intrusion into that privilege that exists between patients and providers,” Amy Whelan, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told The Associated Press after the hearing. “And the issues that they're discussing are really not at issue in a sports case.""Whelan said the next step is to work out internally with the state’s lawyers how those records can be used in court.

ABC,Privacy concerns persist in transgender sports case after Utah judge seals only some health records,2023-12-07 19:53:00,HANNAH SCHOENBAUM Associated Press,"SALT LAKE CITY -- Transgender teenagers who are challenging a Utah law banning trans girls from playing on girls' sports teams can keep portions of their mental health records confidential after a state judge ruled Thursday that some details are irrelevant to the case.Two student-athletes whose families sued over the 2022 state law were ordered in September by Judge Keith Kelly to give state attorneys access to the last seven years of their mental health records, as well as all documents related to medical transition and puberty.Kelly temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the ban, which took effect last year after the Republican-controlled Legislature overrode Gov. Spencer Cox’s veto, while the court continues to assess its legality.Cox drew national attention as one of the few Republican governors who pushed back against state lawmakers’ restrictions on transgender youth, warning that such bans target kids already at a high risk for suicide. Utah is one of more than a dozen states that have passed such bans.Kelly ruled last August that transgender girls could return to athletic competition after hearing several hours of student testimony describing how exclusion from sports was causing them significant distress. He described the ban as “plainly unfavorable treatment” and said it must be put on pause to protect the girls from “irreparable harm” and a severe impact on their mental health.But because the girls' “physical, mental and emotional circumstances” factored into his decision to grant the preliminary injunction, he also determined that their mental health records were relevant to the case.His ruling Thursday does little to alleviate privacy concerns raised by the plaintiffs' attorneys, who argue the state should not have access to the deeply personal mental health records of children who have not waived their therapist-client privilege.Only details concerning irrelevant third parties, certain isolated events and the students' deadnames, or the birth names that they no longer use, will remain redacted, Kelly said Thursday.“These children should have the ability to speak freely in their therapy sessions without an intrusion into that privilege that exists between patients and providers,” Amy Whelan, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told The Associated Press after the hearing. “And the issues that they're discussing are really not at issue in a sports case.""Whelan said the next step is to work out internally with the state’s lawyers how those records can be used in court.

ABC,Indiana judge rules in favor of US Senate candidate seeking GOP nomination,2023-12-07 19:47:00,ISABELLA VOLMERT Associated Press,"INDIANAPOLIS -- An Indiana county judge ruled Thursday a contested state law that stipulates voting requirements for candidates' party affiliation is unconstitutional, dealing a win to a U.S. Senate hopeful who is seeking to run as a Republican in the primary.The Marion County judge granted the injunction sought by John Rust, former chair of the egg supplier Rose Acre Farms who is running to replace Sen. Mike Braun. Rust filed a lawsuit in September against Secretary of State Diego Morales, the Indiana Election Commission and Jackson County Republican Party Chair Amanda Lowery to challenge the law and ensure the possibility of his place on the ballot.The law in question says a candidate’s past two primary elections must be cast with the party the candidate is affiliated with or a county party chair must approve the candidacy. In court documents, Rust argued that this statute “should be struck down as being unconstitutionally vague and overly broad.”“It is a spectacular victory for the voters of Indiana,” Rust said when reached by phone Thursday evening.It was not immediately clear if the secretary of state will appeal the decision. The Associated Press sent an email to its office and left messages with its attorneys Thursday.Rust voted as a Republican in the 2016 primary but as a Democrat in 2012. He did not vote in the 2020 Republican primary due to the pandemic and the lack of competitive Republican races in Jackson County, the lawsuit said. Rust said his Democratic votes were for people he personally knew.Lowery, the county's Republican Party chair, said in a July meeting with Rust that she would not certify him, according to the lawsuit. Rust has said Lowery later cited his primary voting record.When reached by phone, Lowery said she believes party chairs from both parties will be disappointed by the ruling, and questioned how candidacy can be determined without the primary record. She expects the ruling to be appealed.In a November hearing, Rust said the law keeps legitimate candidates who have recently moved to Indiana or have switched political identifications from running for office.In his ruling, Marion County Superior Court Judge Patrick J. Dietrick said the law “unduly burdens Hoosiers’ long recognized right to freely associate with the political party of one’s choosing and to cast one’s vote effectively.” He also ordered the defendants to pay Rust's attorney fees.Rust still faces an uphill challenge for the GOP nomination. U.S. Rep. Jim Banks has received the endorsement of the Indiana Republican Party and former President Donald Trump.

ABC,"Journalists' rights group counts 94 media workers killed worldwide, most at an alarming rate in Gaza",2023-12-07 19:32:00,The Associated Press,"BRUSSELS -- A leading organization representing journalists worldwide expressed deep concern Friday at the number of media professionals killed around the globe doing their jobs in 2023, with Israel’s war with Hamas claiming more journalists than any conflict in over 30 years.In its annual count of media worker deaths, the International Federation of Journalists said 94 journalists had been killed so far this year and almost 400 others had been imprisoned.The group called for better protection for media workers and for their attackers to be held to account.“The imperative for a new global standard for the protection of journalists and effective international enforcement has never been greater,” IFJ President Dominique Pradalié said.The group said 68 journalists had been killed covering the Israeli-Hamas war since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 — more than one a day and 72% of all media deaths worldwide. It said the overwhelming majority of them were Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces continue their offensive.“The war in Gaza has been more deadly for journalists than any single conflict since the IFJ began recording journalists killed in the line of duty in 1990,” the group said, adding that deaths have come at “a scale and pace of loss of media professionals’ lives without precedent.”Ukraine also “remains a dangerous country for journalists” almost two years since Russia's invasion, the organization said. It said three reporters and media workers had been killed in that war so far this year.The organization also deplored media deaths in Afghanistan, the Philippines, India, China and Bangladesh.It expressed concern that crimes against media workers are going unpunished and urged governments “to shed full light on these murders and to put in place measures to ensure the safety of journalists.”It noted a drop in the number of journalists killed in North and South America, from 29 last year to seven so far in 2023. The group said the three Mexicans, one Paraguayan, one Guatemalan, one Colombian and one American were slain while investigating armed groups or the embezzlement of public funds.Africa remained the region least affected by deaths of journalists, but the organization highlighted what it described as “three particularly shocking murders” in Cameroon and Lesotho that it said have yet to be fully investigated.",2384,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/journalists-rights-group-counts-94-media-workers-killed-105482422,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8443aa14-868c-468e-bc22-faaa031311ac/wirestory_ed8a0b91c02ada46aabcd4fd6ec1b0d1_16x9.jpg?w=992,International News,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country slain worldwide ifj afghanistan paraguayan fully record dangerous brussels majority number continue line overwhelm russia kill public cover attack urge lesotho cameroon force remains american hamas highlight annual described concern dominique shed professional full effective guatemalan enforcement journalist china israel president job represent add put day death express group particularly remain america lead scale strip crime place medium embezzlement protection global begin reporter note attacker globe deplore pradalié worker drop federation india region gaza government affected measure murder ensure colombian deadly pace north mexican international deep israeli philippine standard invasion light safety count imperative life friday unpunished year duty claim arm loss palestinian shock conflict ukraine south single held great call organization investigate,-0.97915,1.3842281879194631,12.476038647342993,0.3891301406926407,0
ABC,UN to hold emergency meeting at Guyana's request on Venezuelan claim to a vast oil-rich region,2023-12-07 19:16:00,EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press,"UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency closed meeting Friday at the request of Guyana following Venezuela’s weekend referendum claiming the vast oil- and mineral-rich Essequibo region that makes up a large part of its neighbor.In a letter to the council president, Guyana’s foreign minister, Hugh Hilton Todd, accused Venezuela of violating the U.N. Charter by attempting to take its territory.The letter recounted the arbitration between then-British Guiana and Venezuela in 1899 and the formal demarcation of their border in a 1905 agreement. For over 60 years, he said, Venezuela accepted the boundary, but in 1962 it challenged the 1899 arbitration that set the border.The diplomatic fight over the Essequibo region has flared since then, but it intensified in 2015 after ExxonMobil announced it had found vast amounts of oil off its coast.The dispute escalated as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro held a referendum Sunday in which Venezuelans approved his claim of sovereignty over Essequibo. Maduro has since ordered Venezuela’s state-owned companies to immediately begin exploration in the disputed region.The 61,600-square-mile (159,500-square-kilometer) area accounts for two-thirds of Guyana. But Venezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, has always considered Essequibo as its own because the region was within its boundaries during the Spanish colonial period.In an Associated Press interview Wednesday, Guyanan President Irfaan Ali accused Venezuela of defying a ruling last week by the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands. It ordered Venezuela not to take any action until the court rules on the countries’ competing claims, a process expected to take years.Venezuela’s government condemned Ali’s statement, accusing Guyana of acting irresponsibly and alleging it has given the U.S. military's Southern Command a green light to enter Essequibo.Venezuela called on Guyana to resume dialogue and leave aside its “erratic, threatening and risky conduct.”In his letter to the Security Council, Guyana's foreign minister said Maduro’s actions Tuesday ordering immediate exploration and exploitation of the oil, gas and mines in Essequibo “are flagrant violations of the court’s order, which is legally binding on the parties.”Under Article 94 of the U.N. Charter, Todd said, if any party to a case fails to perform its required obligations, the other party — in this case Guyana — may take the issue to the Security Council.“Venezuela is now guilty of breaching all these obligations, and the actions it has announced that it will soon take will only further aggravate the situation,” Todd said. “Its conduct plainly constitutes a direct threat to Guyana’s peace and security, and more broadly threatens the peace and security of the entire region.”",2823,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/hold-emergency-meeting-guyanas-request-venezuelan-claim-vast-105481793,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/6e4fd3f8-7271-4522-a0cf-fa92e34f4f21/wirestory_fc2437e2c566ee0c9f2b340404d4724f_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country demarcation enter aggravate associate charter irfaan defy case justice threatens resume threaten guyana ruling todd request guilty threat nicolas arbitration party amount make irresponsibly schedule sunday intensified court dispute foreign close violate large formal spanish exploration reserve expect command perform interview breaching united weekend diplomatic rule situation proven leave company president tuesday violation article compete minister part allege boundary accepted gas constitutes sovereignty green netherlands week flagrant approve wednesday risky emergency legally begin consider exploitation binding entire process vast oil broadly plainly maduro military nation guyanan referendum council region southern government give meeting challenged world colonial set account venezuelan conduct essequibo announce order action statement issue hilton international flare exxonmobil peace border letter escalate agreement light require fight accuse press immediate friday erratic year immediately dialogue obligation claim direct guiana recount follow hugh held condemn act attempt venezuela security found call area fails,-0.8897,0.0,12.729999999999993,0.3832717569786535,0
ABC,Is the US economy on track for a 'soft landing'? Friday's jobs report may offer clues,2023-12-07 18:59:00,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER AP economics writer,"WASHINGTON -- Can the U.S. economy achieve a much-hyped “soft landing”? Friday's jobs report for November will provide some signs of whether that elusive scenario is coming into view.Many of the most recent economic figures have been encouraging. Companies are advertising fewer job openings, and Americans are switching jobs less often than they did a year ago, trends that typically slow wage growth and inflation pressures. Hiring is cooling, and price increases have moderated significantly.All of which means the Federal Reserve may stand an increasingly good chance of bringing inflation down to its 2% annual target without causing a deep recession — the common definition of a soft landing.Yet that effort isn't without risks. The economy could slow so much as to slide into a recession. The unemployment rate, which began the year at an ultra-low 3.4%, has since risen to 3.9% as more Americans have come off the sidelines to look for jobs and not found them right away. The number of people receiving unemployment aid, though still low, has risen. And for much of this year, hiring has been concentrated in just a few sectors — notably health care, restaurants and hotels and government — rather than broadly across the economy.The November jobs report from the Labor Department is expected to show that employers added a still-solid 172,500 jobs last month, according to a survey of economists by FactSet. That would slightly exceed October's 150,000 gain.Yet November's increase will be exaggerated by the addition of United Auto Workers members as well as by Hollywood actors whose strikes ended in October and who returned to work in November. Their return is expected to account for about 40,000 of November's job gains.Hiring has been cooling as the Fed's sharp interest rate hikes have raised borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, depressing sales of homes, cars, appliances and other high-priced purchases and investments. From August through October, job growth averaged 204,000 a month, down sharply from a 342,000 average in the same three-month period in 2022.Though the nation's jobless rate remains comparatively low, economists nevertheless worry that a rising rate can feed on itself: Unemployed workers tend to cut back on spending, thereby slowing the economy and leading other businesses to lay off employees, too. By one rule of thumb, if the jobless rate were to rise just a few tenths of a percentage point more, the increase would be consistent with the start of a recession.Yet if the data did start to point toward a recession, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could signal that the central bank would cut rates soon to lower borrowing costs. Such a message would likely ignite a rally in the financial markets and potentially boost the economy.For now, most analysts are offering a positive outlook of slower but still steady growth and easing inflation. The economy is expected to expand at a modest 1.5% annual rate in the final three months of this year, down from a scorching 5.2% pace in the July-September quarter. Cooler growth should help bring down inflation while still supporting a modest pace of hiring.The economy is still expanding even after the Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times, from near zero in March 2022 to about 5.4%, the highest level in 22 years. The aggressive pace of those hikes has made mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing much more expensive.At the same time, inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to just 3.2% last month. And according to a different inflation measure that the Fed prefers, prices rose at just a 2.5% annual rate in the past six months — not far below the central bank's target.Such progress has fueled speculation in the financial markets that the Fed could soon cut its benchmark rate, perhaps as early as March. Wall Street traders now expect five rate cuts next year, according to futures prices tracked by CME FedWatch.

ABC,Republicans double down on border demands as clock ticks down on Ukraine aid,2023-12-07 18:43:00,Allison Pecorin,"After Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic-led effort to advance an emergency aid package for Ukraine and Israel, GOP senators on Thursday doubled down on their strategy of trying to exact border policy changes in exchange for their support for the measure.They're also calling on President Joe Biden, who has made getting the aid approved before the end of the year aid a top priority, to get directly involved in the Senate negotiations.""What's next? What's next is the commander in chief -- Joe Biden -- needs to wake up and do something about a broken border,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, who's been directly involved in the negotiations over changes in border package, said Thursday.Republicans involved in the tense talks welcomed Biden's comments Wednesday that he was prepared to ""make significant compromises on the border"" if it meant securing aid for Ukraine.ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang asked National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby if Biden had made any calls to Capitol Hill after the failed vote to press for the supplemental aid request.While Kirby said he had no calls to read out, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said administration officials are ""in close touch"" with lawmakers on both sides.""It's stunning this we have gotten to this point,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""And that Republicans in congress are willing to give [Russian President Vladimir] Putin a gift, the greatest gift Putin could hope for. That's what we are seeing. And so they are playing chicken with our national security, that's what we are seeing here, and history will remember them harshly.""Asked by a reporter if the White House assure Ukraine additional funding is coming, Kirby said, ""We are not in a position to make that promise to Ukraine, given where things are on the Hill.""If the White House wants a win on Ukraine, Republicans say, then the White House has to negotiate directly with senators.""When you're making law, the president has got to be involved,"" Sen. James Lankford, whose been leading negotiations for Republicans, said as he was departed Washington Thursday afternoon. ""I'll leave it to him to be able to determine what that really means for him but obviously the White House has got to be engaged in this. If the White House is not engaged into the negotiations then nothing is going to get done on it.""Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree they'd like to get something done on Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the southern border before Congress leaves for the holiday recess at the end of next week.But time is slipping away fast, even as the administration issues warnings about the dire state of affairs in Ukraine. Without major progress in negotiations over the Ukraine aid package, there will be little keep them senators in Washington.Lankford said he hopes lawmakers will stay in for an extra week, up to just before the Christmas holiday, to allow more time to complete their work.""There's a week left on the schedule, but we've added weeks before,"" Lankford said. ""If we've got the time to be able to finish it, let's get it finished.""Talks between Lankford and his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Chris Murphy, continued Thursday even after a temporary pause. The two met behind the scenes where Lankford presented an offer, but it did not appear any progress was made.Lankford left saying conversations will likely continue remotely over the weekend.But Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who's been involved in negotiations, said the group remains quite far apart.""We're not at a point where we've reduced things down to writing. There's still major decisions that have to be made about the contours of the agreement and us being able to go back to our conference and say this going to reduce future flows,"" Tillis said.Senators on both sides of the aisle continued to emphasize their belief that something has got to get done soon to aid Ukraine and Israel, but the mass expanse of space between where Democrats and Republicans stand on border issues will be exceptionally difficult to stem in the week remaining before Congress breaks.Republicans today held a press conference to re-emphasize the need to address what they say is a humanitarian crisis at the southern border.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made clear that Republicans see this moment, with Ukraine and Israel aid hanging in the balance, to leverage something the White House wants for border policy.""President Biden has been unmoved to work with us to try to come up with a solution until now. We've found something that provides us the opportunity to force the administration to do something they have not wanted to do up to this point and we intend to do everything we can to make sure these policies are put in place to stem the flow of illegal immigration into this country, along with all of the problems that go along with it,"" Cornyn said.Senate Republicans want major revisions to parole and asylum provisions. House Republicans want even more, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has advocated that the Senate work to keep the border provisions as close to those outlined in the House bill as possible.But H.R. 2, and policies like it, remain non-starters for Democrats, and passing aid to Ukraine will almost certainly require Democratic support, because many House Republicans do not support Ukraine aid of any kind.""That is why I am so frustrated about proposals Republicans are bringing to us that get no Democratic votes. This is their problem, the fact that House Republicans are deeply split on Ukraine. To solve their problem, we have to get lots of Democratic votes. The only way to get lots of Democratic votes is to not load the bill up with extreme hardline unpassable immigration policy,"" Murphy said.

ABC,Penn's president apologizes for response on how to handle calls for 'genocide of Jews',2023-12-07 18:32:00,Sarah Beth Hensley,"The University of Pennsylvania's president on Thursday faced new backlash for her comments during a congressional hearing -- after she had already apologized for how she said she would handle remarks in the university community calling for the ""genocide of Jews.""The Republican-led House Education Committee announced Thursday that it is opening an investigation into the policies and disciplinary procedures at Penn, Harvard and MIT after finding testimony from Elizabeth Magill, Penn's president, along with that of Harvard President Claudine Gay and MIT President Sally Kornbluth -- ""absolutely unacceptable.""Rep. Virginia Foxx, the committee's Republican chairwoman, said members have ""deep concerns with their leadership and their failure to take steps to provide Jewish students the safe learning environment they are due under law.""Several of Pennsylvania's elected leaders have denounced Magill's comments made during Tuesday's congressional hearing, with some calling for her resignation. The university's board of trustees held a hastily scheduled meeting Thursday, but there is no board plan for imminent leadership change at Penn, according to the university spokesperson.During the House Education Committee hearing Tuesday on how three university presidents have handled antisemitism on their campuses, Magill had a tense exchange with New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik.Stefanik asked Magill to respond ""yes or no"" if calling for the ""genocide of Jews"" violated Penn's rules or code of conduct.Magill replied, ""If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. Yes.""Stefanik followed up: ""I am asking, specifically, calling for the genocide of Jews, does that constitute bullying or harassment?""Magill responded that it was a ""context-dependent decision.""""It's a context-dependent decision -- that's your testimony today? Stefanik countered. ""Calling for the genocide of Jews is depending upon the context?""Hours later, amid bipartisan backlash, including from prominent Democrats, Magill apologized for her response in a video posted on the university's website.""I was not focused on, but I should have been, the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It's evil -- plain and simple,"" Magill said in the video.In a reversal, using direct language, Magill said that type of language is ""harassment or intimidation.""""I want to be clear, a call for genocide of Jewish people is threatening -- deeply so. It is intentionally meant to terrify a people who have been subjected to pogroms and hatred for centuries and were the victims of mass genocide in the Holocaust,"" she said.Magill said Penn will take a ""serious and careful look"" at its ""longstanding policies aligned with the U.S. Constitution, which say that speech alone is not punishable.""""In today's world, where we are seeing signs of hate proliferating across our campus and our world in a way not seen in years, these policies need to be clarified and evaluated,"" Magill said.Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania bashed Magill's ""absolutely shameful"" comments in the back-and-forth with Stefanik.""That was an unacceptable statement from the president of Penn,"" Shapiro, who is Jewish, said Wednesday. ""Frankly, I thought her comments were absolutely shameful. It should not be hard to condemn genocide.""Shapiro said if calling for the genocide of Jews ""doesn't violate the policies of Penn, well, there's something wrong with the policies of Penn that the board needs to get on, or there's a failure of leadership from the president, or both.""Shapiro is a nonvoting board member at the university.During the Tuesday hearing, Stefanik called on Magill -- as well as the other university presidents who testified -- to resign.A petition on Change.org demanding Magill's resignation had more than 14,000 signatures as of Thursday afternoon.Pennsylvania State Sen. Steve Santarsiero, a Democrat, has joined the call to oust Magill saying that her ""coached"" answer ""utterly failed to express the moral clarity that the question demanded.""Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., called Magill's response to Stefanik ""offensive"" in a post on X.""President Magill's comments yesterday were offensive, but equally offensive was what she didn't say. The right to free speech is fundamental, but calling for the genocide of Jews is antisemitic and harassment, full stop,"" Casey said.Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., said Magill's comments were ""embarrassing.""""There is no 'both sides-ism' and it isn't 'free speech,' it's simply hate speech,"" he said to The New York Times. ""It was embarrassing for a venerable Pennsylvania university, and it should be reflexive for leaders to condemn antisemitism and stand up for the Jewish community or any community facing this kind of invective.""National leaders are weighing in as well.At the lighting of the National Menorah for Hanukkah on Thursday, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, condemned the university presidents' remarks.""We’ve seen the presidents of some of our most elite universities literally unable to denounce calling for the genocide of Jews as antisemitic. That lack of moral clarity is simply unacceptable,"" Emhoff said.""Let me be clear: When Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or identity, and when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is antisemitism and it must be condemned, and condemned unequivocally and without context,"" he said.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Thursday morning that antisemitic comments should never be tolerated on college campuses.""I think it's important for every university leader to unequivocally make clear that antisemitism has no place on a single college campus,"" he said.White House spokesman Andrew Bates blasted the university presidents for their responses as well.""It's unbelievable that this needs to be said: calls for genocide are monstrous and antithetical to everything we represent as a country,"" Bates said in a statement.Harvard President Claudine Gay issued a statement Wednesday to clarify her comments similar to Magill's during the hearing that drew bipartisan ire.""Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard,"" she said.",6340,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/upenns-president-apologizes-response-handle-calls-genocide-jews/story?id=105453653,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1d69101d-8749-466c-86af-cc92cca6056d/liz-magill-01-ap-jef-231207_1701958872854_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,constitute country bullying harvard leadership oust minority respond depend response change investigation frankly monstrous jewish unacceptable elizabeth backlash mass kind stop chairwoman fundamental vile free century stefanik bash type venerable similar andrew trustee coached utterly full campus rule santarsiero shameful doug procedure religious resignation reflexive handle represent pogrom wrong law express amid meant irrefutable unable demand congressional yesterday learn gov simple reversal clarity wednesday terrible kornbluth embarrass imminent accord rep due john gentleman elite video hastily antisemitism violence board meeting careful stand hakeem answer menorah student fetterman conduct harassment university spokesman sign republican tolerate ire foxx simply plain turn light casey national website jeffries remark absolutely year hard lack direct step post follow single specifically member intentionally condemn held deeply weigh drew clear hatred leader perpetrate victim unequivocally disciplinary speech unbelievable morning threaten nonvoting genocide code make schedule antithetical bob fail exchange policy college violate antisemitic context concern opening plan hate josh claudine x safe hour shapiro israel education president invective tuesday counter question environment offensive comment tense group find evil failure punishable ethnic fact state place join holocaust elect decision reply elise penn longstanding intimidation focus blast magill york belief include gay petition emhoff virginia clarify important denounce world hanukkah constitution announce time thursday bipartisan subject statement issue house proliferate pennsylvania deep identity today target provide testimony prominent testify sally steve signature jew hearing language literally human terrify align bates apologize community call equally evaluate democrat committee,-0.99745,0.1419558359621451,10.538877551020406,0.47435588604943435,0
ABC,"Made in America: Christmas trees at local farms, national forests and your backyard",2023-12-07 18:31:00,Eric Noll and Joanne Rosa,"For the 12th year running, ABC News' ""World News Tonight"" is spotlighting small businesses across the country making and selling American-made products in its annual Made in America Christmas series – and it all starts with the tree.From chopping your own at a farm or a national park to planting one in your backyard, David Muir shares how Americans can find the perfect tree for the holiday season.While strolling the sidewalks in SoHo, New York City, you'll find David Stess, a photographer who's been selling trees for the past 13 years. He spends part of the year working on farms in America and during the winter season, he lives in the city and helps New Yorkers find the perfect tree to gather around at Christmastime.Stess told Muir that he sees ""what farms and farmers are up against"" each year, and thinks that purchasing a tree ""helps a lot"" when it comes to supporting their livelihood.In the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, tree farmer Charles Sturgill was behind the frasier fir that Muir spotted at Stess' tree stand. The farm was founded in 1968, and Sturgill planted his own tree on the farm 30 years ago when he was just a teenager.Families can also harvest their very own holiday tree at their favorite national forest. This is the fourth season the USDA Forest Service is selling Christmas tree permits, which must be purchased prior to the visit either online or at district ranger stations.By cutting down a tree at a national park, you can create a memorable experience that also maintains the forest's overall health by helping to ""thin densely populated stands of small-diameter trees,"" according to Recreation.gov.Olivia Garcia of the White River National Forest in Colorado shared some tips before heading to your national forest to chop down a tree for the holiday season.""Make sure that you bundle up, dress really warm. Get a warm coat warm pants, good waterproof boots, gloves a hat dress for the elements,"" Garcia said. She added that it's important to measure the room you're planning to place your tree in and the size of your door beforehand.Also in Sunny Colorado is Brian Banks with the Pike and San Isabel National Forest, west of Colorado Springs. Banks revealed that the most popular trees are the Douglas fir and the blue spruce.If you're looking to plant some roots for your Christmases ahead, look no further than the Jonsteen Tree Company in California. Various types of evergreen trees are available to purchase as seedlings, shipped to you, and then planted to enjoy for years to come.Previously featured on Made in America, Jonsteen Tree Company co-founder Jonathan Claasen has been listening to feedback from ""World News Tonight"" viewers.""In the years since we first met you, David, we've heard from people all over the country,"" Claasen said.

The study did not provide a comparable five-year number for the U.S. but said the national rate was 20.1 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019 and 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020.Mississippi has long been one of the poorest states in the U.S., with some of the highest rates of obesity and heart disease.A state health department program called Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies offers care management and home visits for pregnant women and for infants who are at risk of having health problems.“Losing one mother is too many,” Dr. Daniel Edney, the state health officer, said in a news release about the maternal mortality study.The committee recommended that Mississippi leaders expand Medicaid to people who work in lower-wage jobs that don't provide private health insurance — a policy proposal that Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has long opposed.Earlier this year, Reeves signed a law allowing postpartum Medicaid coverage for a full year, up from two months.Medicaid expansion is optional under the health care overhaul that then-President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010, and Mississippi is one of 10 states that have not taken the option. The non-expansion states have Republican governors, Republican-controlled Legislatures or both.“Medicaid expansion should be incorporated for rural hospitals to remain open and include access to telehealth services,” the Maternal Mortality Review Committee leaders wrote. “There is a need for rural healthcare facilities to provide higher levels of critical care, recruit and retain adequate providers, and have access to life saving equipment, especially in the most vulnerable areas of the state.”The study examined deaths that occurred during or within one year after pregnancy. It defined pregnancy-related deaths as those “initiated by pregnancy, or the aggravation of an unrelated condition by the physiologic effects of pregnancy” and pregnancy-associated deaths as those “from a cause that is not related to pregnancy.”Pregnancy-related deaths during the five years included 17 homicides and four suicides, plus 26 instances of substance abuse disorder contributing to the maternal death and 30 instances of mental health conditions other than substance abuse disorder contributing to a death.The study also said obesity contributed to 32 maternal deaths and discrimination contributed to 22.

ABC,"Some Californians released from prison will receive $2,400 under new state re-entry program",2023-12-07 18:09:00,CHRISTOPHER WEBER Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES -- Hundreds of Californians released from prisons could receive direct cash payments of $2,400 — along with counseling, job search assistance and other support — under a first-in-the-nation program aimed at easing the transition out of incarceration and reducing recidivism.Recipients will get the money over a series of payments after meeting certain milestones such as showing progress in finding places to live and work, according to the Center for Employment Opportunities, which runs the program announced this week.The goal is to give people a chance “to cover their most essential needs” like bus fare and food during the crucial early days after exiting incarceration, said Samuel Schaeffer, CEO of the national nonprofit that helps those leaving lockups find jobs and achieve financial security.“The first three to six months are the riskiest, when many people end up back in prison,” Schaeffer said Thursday. “We want to take advantage of this moment to immediately connect people with services, with financial support, to avoid recidivism.”The governor's Workforce Development Board, devoted to improving the state's labor pool, is providing a $6.9 million grant to boost community-based organizations and expand so-called re-entry services for the formerly incarcerated.About $2 million of that will go directly to ex-inmates in the form of cash payments totaling about $2,400 each. The center said the money will be paid incrementally upon reaching milestones including: engaging in employment interview preparation meetings with a jobs coach; making progress toward earning an industry credential or certificate; and creating a budget and opening a bank account.Schaeffer said the new program is a “game changer” and the first of its kind in the nation, one he hopes other states will copy.He said his group distributes money and coordinates services along with local groups that provide services including career training and mental health counseling. The program got a sort of test run at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the Center for Employment Opportunities was tasked with distributing direct payments to about 10,000 people struggling with financial difficulties.Schaeffer said to promote equitable access to the funds, the center is recommending its partners impose limited eligibility criteria for receiving payments. Aside from meeting the agreed-upon milestones, there are no rules for how the money can be spent.Advocates say people returning from incarceration often struggle to find places to live and work as they try to reintegrate back into their communities. Around 60% of formerly incarcerated individuals remain unemployed within the first year of being home, the center estimates.Assemblyman Tom Lackey, a Republican from Palmdale who often focuses on justice system issues, said he applauds any attempt to reduce recidivism. But he worries this new program lacks a way to track progress and make sure taxpayers are getting their money's worth.“If we are going to issue stipends without parameters for accountability I worry about the return on our investment as it relates to outcomes and community safety,” Lackey said in a statement Thursday.Schaeffer said he expects his organization will be flexible as the program rolls out, ""to keep on refining it and keep on getting smarter on how to use it"" and make sure every dollar counts.“I wish this partnership had existed while I was in re-entry,” said Carmen Garcia, who was formerly incarcerated himself and is now director of the Root & Rebound, a nonprofit offering legal advocacy for people leaving prison.",3618,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/californians-released-prison-receive-2400-new-state-entry-105480568,https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f6ef6646-ef5e-4330-bd41-c0fdb52bc55d/wirestory_72baa30af04fe525cb396f8e6864dbcf_16x9.jpg?w=992,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KAIEmdZnussbmh0xL1UqIAHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,employment payment taxpayer incarcerate back cash return recommend preparation outcome coordinate cover worry rebound partnership kind track improve distribute promote crucial nonprofit service fare ceo sort reduce samuel interview moment rule parameter devote palmdale leave smarter aim system stipend wish struggle receive day labor unemployed changer formerly remain release game reach expand reintegrate incrementally root tom total avoid financial partner local accord impose distributes career live nation earn board meeting tasked mental eligibility million home republican form limited test bank accountability center national safety exist search workforce year immediately lack connect boost direct advantage advocacy riskiest dollar program justice chance milestone make expect bus early opening opportunity paid equitable achieve access certificate lackey industry credential garcia work grant support legal directly californian month job investment hundred progress roll governor group prison find pandemic pool goal state incarceration place food schaeffer focus coach include criterion director fund run engage angeles transition budget give recidivism money individual health announce relates thursday carmen statement issue lockup applauds provide show exit essential development offering training create ease hope refining attempt counsel height community organization flexible assistance series,0.9854,0.0,13.05452188006483,0.3202655809798666,0
Politico,Washington Post staffers launch 24-hour walkout,2023-12-07 13:23:00,Eric Bazail-Eimil,"More than 700 staffers at The Washington Post launched a 24-hour walkout Thursday after contract negotiations with the newspaper’s leadership have stalled after 18 months.Reporters, producers, editors and business-side staffers walked off the job and began picketing outside the Post’s enigmatic downtown headquarters in the first protest action at the paper since the mid-1970s.The Washington Post Guild, a member of the broader Washington-Baltimore NewsGuild, is accusing management of negotiating in “bad faith” as they seek to obtain a contract that they say must address pay disparities and offer employees raises and job protections as layoffs loom at the struggling storied paper.“We still lack a contract that keeps pace with record-level inflation and guarantees workers a living wage,” the union posted in a statement online, blaming previous leadership at the Post for the company’s current financial woes.A spokesperson for the Post said in a statement to POLITICO that “we respect the rights of our Guild-covered colleagues to engage in this planned one-day strike” and “will make sure our readers and customers are as unaffected as possible.”“The Post’s goal remains the same as it has from the start of our negotiations: to reach an agreement with the Guild that meets the needs of our employees and the needs of our business,” the spokesperson continued.In a video posted ahead of the walkout, Post staffers also called on the public to not cross the picket line, urging readers not to engage with content on the Post’s website and for freelancers to ignore assignment offers.The walkout comes as Post leadership seeks to rectify a $100 million shortfall, floating the possibility of buyouts or layoffs at the paper in order to bridge the gap. Incoming CEO Will Lewis, a Dow Jones veteran, has been tasked by the paper’s owners to turn the tide of declining readerships and subscriptions amid rising costs.Over the past year, the Post has laid off almost 40 employees, according to the Guild. Acting CEO Patty Stonesifer said that the Post would offer 240 voluntary buyouts for Post employees in October, but only 120 have taken the buyouts thus far. In November, Stonesifer said that “involuntary buyouts” could follow if the buyouts target is not met.It is not the first strike action at a major news outlet in the past year. Staffers at digital outlet Insider staged a 13-day walkout, the longest in the history of digital media, in June.Employees at the New York Times have also gone on strike twice in the last year. Employees staged a company-wide one-day walk out on Dec. 7, 2022 and tech workers staged a half-day walkout in October to protest an order to return to the office.The NewsGuild, an affiliate of the Communications Workers of America, represents journalists from media outlets including POLITICO.",2832,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/washington-post-24-hour-walkout-00130625,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/f7e26b2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5234x3489+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fdb%2F69%2Feff0321740b0baa2fc2f62cd817a%2Fwashington-post-strike-76007.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,leadership raise november meet respect stonesifer assignment enigmatic layoff outlet return line inflation public negotiate urge owner remains make ahead guarantee storied launch major long bridge headquarters ceo insider newspaper contract laid plan lewis online wage tide content journalist producer address previous offer company reader incoming guild job readership struggle represent start gap walk amid jones patty shortfall goal america reach ignore medium seek union possibility financial digital protection colleague decline subscription begin strike stag accord cross york pay paper include disparity worker past video stall history engage veteran october broader living voluntary current blame tasked protest loom employee customer million pace picket management thursday order action time statement rectify washington politico affiliate float target staffer news agreement turn obtain website accuse editor faith year freelancer lack dow post walkout follow newsguild unaffected member act business communication rise tech spokesperson negotiation downtown call buyout involuntary,-0.6157,0.0,11.139999999999997,0.3197059884559884,0
Politico,Democrats pick Suozzi to replace George Santos in special election,2023-12-07 18:37:00,Nick Reisman,"NEW YORK — The race to replace George Santos is underway.Former Rep. Tom Suozzi was tapped Thursday to be the Democratic nominee to replace the scandal-scarred Santos in a critical Long Island seat that will be one of the major battleground races in the nation — the first major one of 2024.New York Democrats are turning to the well-known Suozzi to run in the Feb. 13 special election called by Gov. Kathy Hochul after Santos was expelled from the House last week.Suozzi’s bid received the backing of Queens Rep. Greg Meeks and Jay Jacobs, the chair of both the Nassau County Democrats and the statewide party, who endorsed him in a joint statement.In a special election, party bosses pick the candidates to fill the remainder of the term. Then there would still be the potential of a primary in June ahead of the November election for a full, two-year term starting in 2025.“Tom Suozzi has a proven record of fighting for his constituents, fighting to safeguard our suburban way of life here on Long Island and Queens and always advocating for sensible solutions to the real challenges affecting everyday average Americans,” they said in the statement.The special election is expected to draw national interest and millions of dollars in campaign spending to the district, which covers parts of Nassau County and Queens. Republicans have yet to name a candidate for the race.Democrats hope to flip the district in the special election and narrow the razor-thin Republican majority in the House, with New York expected to play a pivotal role in 2024.An estimated six House seats in New York, five of which are held by first-term Republicans, are considered to be battleground seats next year, including the one Santos represented for less than a year.Set in a bellwether and largely suburban district, the February contest is also expected to be an early test and showcase for messaging among both parties with issues like the migrant crisis, public safety and abortion expected to loom large.“I will work day and night with both parties to deliver for the people to make living here more affordable, safer, and better. I delivered for this district before, and I will do it again by putting you ahead of partisanship,” Suozzi said in a statement.Suozzi, a former three-term lawmaker who is considered a moderate, left Congress in 2022 to run an unsuccessful Democratic primary against Hochul. He also served as the mayor of Glen Cove and the Nassau County executive.The primary challenge rankled Hochul, and she huddled privately with Suozzi in Albany earlier this week to clear the air and discuss campaign strategy.“I wanted to talk to him directly about what his plan was and how he would run his race,” Hochul told reporters at an unrelated news conference in the Bronx on Wednesday.The meeting included a discussion over polling and strategy so Democrats can “run the strongest possible candidate” to replace Santos, she said.Republicans knocked Suozzi’s conciliatory approach with Hochul, who has registered low job approval ratings in public polling.“Given that voters are already fed up with her handling of crime and the migrant crisis, Tom Suozzi prostrating himself for Kathy Hochul is bound to end poorly for him,” Savannah Viar, a spokesperson for the House GOP’s campaign committee said.Democrats are trying to demonstrate a united front. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised the selection as someone with “a proven record of results.”And Democratic candidates also sought to coalesce around Suozzi.Party leaders passed over Suozzi’s remaining rival, former state Sen. Anna Kaplan, who had announced her campaign for the seat earlier this year. She endorsed Suozzi in a statement soon after the nomination was announced.Republicans are expected to announce their candidate in the coming days. Party leaders have insisted they will conduct a rigorous vetting process when screening candidates after the Santos fiasco of his lies about his life experiences.Already there have been questions raised about the backgrounds of some of the potential nominees.Records show Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip, elected on the GOP line, enrolled as a Democrat. Another candidate, Mike Sapraicone, recounted a story in April on a podcast that he found a person scary because they were Black.State Sen.

Politico,California’s budget deficit swells to record $68B as tax revenue falls,2023-12-07 12:41:00,Blake Jones,"California’s budget deficit has swelled to a record $68 billion after months of unexpectedly low tax revenues, a shortfall that could prompt the state’s deepest spending cuts since the Great Recession.The latest deficit figure — calculated by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office and released Thursday — far exceeds the $14.3 billion estimate from June. The shortfall, which is the highest in dollar terms but not as a percentage of overall spending, threatens to upend the upcoming legislative year by forcing Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers to make spending cuts on a scale few term-limited elected officials in Sacramento have faced.While not minimizing the shortfall, state budget analysts said California has options to address the deficit — including the use of cash reserves, one-time cuts in spending and changes to the way it funds education — that it didn’t have in previous downturns.“The state remains in a good cash position, and that really wasn’t the case back at the start of the Great Recession,” Gabriel Petek, an LAO analyst, told reporters. “We don’t face the same kind of liquidity challenges that we had at that time, and so I would stop short of describing it as a crisis.”The LAO forecasts a $4 billion drop in the amount of funding the state is required to send to schools and community colleges under Proposition 98, adding education to a list of possible targets for reductions that also includes climate and health care.Analysts suggested legislators could ease the situation with one-time cuts, reducing school funding or tapping into the around $30 billion in reserves. Legislative leadership floated drawing from its savings last year, but Newsom opposed that move and the money was left alone. Debates over the use of reserve funds will likely intensify next year, given the size of the shortfall.Analysts have also projected annual $30 billion deficits in future years. The LAO recommended leaving up to half of the state’s reserves intact to help mitigate those future shortfalls.Tax filing deadlines across most of California were delayed from April until last month, leaving the analysts in the dark about how much revenue was available. After seeing cash receipts, they forecasted that revenue would fall $58 billion short of previous expectations, fueling the massive deficit.Newsom’s Department of Finance earlier this year warned California would continue to face a revenue downturn due to stock market declines, interest rate hikes and inflation.“Both the Governor and the Legislature face a significant challenge with the 2024 budget,” the department’s spokesman, H.D. Palmer, said in a statement following the release of the LAO projections. “The Administration will present its plan to close the budget gap when the Governor sends his proposal to the Legislature next month.”The release of Newsom’s budget proposal will set in motion negotiations over how to address the financial situation. A smaller deficit last year forced the governor to make the largest cuts of his tenure after years of massive surpluses. The state avoided deeper reductions by delaying spending and shifting money between the state’s general and special funds.“Our economy is still good, but what we need to do is be incredibly cautious here,” Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins said in an interview. “We are in a deficit, and therefore, new programs, new spending — in fact, existing spending — we’re going to have to slow down over time.”California could offset some cuts by further delaying spending, making some funding conditional on revenue bouncing back, or shifting money to bonds. But there’s already stiff competition for bond money, with mental health on the March ballot and November ballot proposals for education, climate and housing.The stock market has started to recover, and California’s deficit could shrink if that continues by generating additional capital gains taxes. It would also reflect financial stability among some of the companies the state relies on for revenue.“Stock prices are important leading indicators for future #CABudget revenues, and the indicators are up,” Jason Sisney, budget director for Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this week.Yet whether — and how much — those trends will shrink the state deficit won’t be clear until later next year, when Newsom unveils an updated budget proposal and deficit projections in May.Lara Korte contributed to this report.",4462,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/californias-budget-deficit-balloons-to-68b-00130624,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/153c9df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7180x4787+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe9%2F0e%2F803f67cf48b99bdbe0e53d32d146%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1252545223,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,slow funding climate leadership conditional available send fall november change record short cash back korte recommend threatens continue generate describe incredibly remains amount kind indicator stop suggest half sends close competition annual large contribute reserve reduce draw warn surplus tap interview sacramento project tenure reduction leave exceeds address company start gap percentage write told delayed release legislative senate gov upend sisney april school avoid financial robert jason trend petek ballot present recession dark department stock reporter move due california capital deadline late cautious price small drop bond estimate deficit mental significant mitigate set liquidity figure spokesman gabriel market unexpectedly upcoming projection speaker require filing exist toni year shrink post downturn follow report swell clear negotiation official interest reflect motion rate dollar saving recover june case program intensify palmer receipt nonpartisan tax force make proposition special spending possible college administration plan unveils legislator situation bounce calculate option atkins previous education president month lawmaker economy analyst add governor revenue expectation debate shortfall term lead scale fact pro proposal state finance delay hike shift elect low update newsom minimize lao challenge decline high gavin fuel position earlier future deeper include cabudget director fund linkedin general important budget forecast give money left health deepest time cut thursday statement rivas additional office float target offset legislature oppose list ease march massive billion stability prompt assembly great community size intact stiff relies,-0.18385,0.20170327207530256,10.808009828009826,0.37381543774986387,0
Politico,Georgia just obliterated Lucy McBath’s district. She says she’s not going anywhere.,2023-12-07 12:06:00,Zach Montellaro,"Georgia Republicans just shredded Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath’s suburban Atlanta district — but she says she will fight to remain in Congress.The Republican-controlled state Legislature on Thursday passed a new congressional map that increases the number of majority-Black districts in the state after a federal judge found that Georgia’s previous lines violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of Black voters.The map, however, maintains the same likely partisan split as before: Nine seats Republicans are strongly favored to hold, and five for Democrats. It increases the number of majority-Black districts by effectively erasing the district held by McBath, a prominent Black lawmaker whose district is known as a “coalition” district, where Black, Latino and Asian voters make up a majority.Democratic-backed groups have vowed to challenge the new map in court again, meaning it’s possible the lines passed Thursday aren’t ultimately used for next year’s elections. But at least for now, McBath’s district is gone.But she says she isn’t going anywhere.“I intend to come back to Washington,” McBath told POLITICO on Tuesday, just after the state Senate passed the new map.The state House subsequently passed the map Thursday, sending it to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who is expected to sign it into law before a court-imposed Friday deadline. Georgia Republicans also passed state legislative maps that add a few majority-Black districts while guaranteeing GOP control there as well.Georgia will now have four congressional districts where Black residents make up a majority of the voting-age population, along with a district just below that 50 percent mark. All five are Democratic-leaning.The previous map also had five majority-minority — and Democratic — districts: Two majority-Black districts, two just below 50 percent and McBath’s 7th District — a district with no single racial or ethnic majority but a majority-minority coalition of Black, Latino and Asian voters.McBath’s district to Atlanta’s northeast is effectively divvied up among four districts in the new map, with a new majority-Black district created to the city’s west. Both the old and new maps have nine majority-white districts; they are all currently held by Republicans, and the GOP is almost certain to keep them after next year’s elections.The state’s filing deadline won’t be until March, so candidates do not have to file immediately to run. But most assume that, should these maps stand, McBath would run in the newly created 6th District, which would be an entirely new constituency for her.“My focus and my direction will not change. We will serve any constituents I am given, in the same way we always have: putting their needs first,” McBath said.Even with a new set of constituents, McBath — an anti-gun violence activist who first entered Congress as part of the 2018 Democratic wave — would still be a powerhouse.McBath has broad name ID and is regularly floated as a potential statewide candidate, including for the open 2026 gubernatorial race, and she is a prolific fundraiser. McBath would also likely have broad support across the Democratic Party. She has been fundraising off the new maps — including sending joint emails with the state party.The redrawing of the congressional lines also affects other incumbents. Most notably GOP Rep. Rich McCormick, who currently represents the 6th District. He is expected to run in the new 7th District — which shares a core with his current district, while shedding some Democratic-leaning areas around Atlanta. He has also said he would run no matter what the maps look like.Democrats have already signaled they will look to challenge the new maps in court. “The Republican-proposed congressional map is yet another attempt to defy federal district court orders enforcing Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act at the expense of Georgia’s voters,” Marina Jenkins, executive director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement earlier this week. The group is involved in several of the lawsuits challenging congressional and legislative lines in the Peach State.Democrats will likely focus on the destruction of McBath’s majority-minority district.When federal District Court Judge Steve C. Jones, an appointee of President Barack Obama, declared that the maps violated the Voting Rights Act, he wrote in his order that Georgia should add an “an additional majority-Black congressional district in the west-metro Atlanta.”Democrats contend that order can’t be addressed by shuffling around the current districts, since Jones wrote that Georgia “cannot remedy the Section 2 violations described herein by eliminating minority opportunity districts elsewhere.”Republicans counter that erasing McBath’s old majority-minority district doesn’t violate that order because Jones did not mean to protect coalition districts in which no group makes up a majority.“Districts composed of less than a majority of a single minority group are not ‘opportunity districts’ protected by the Voting Rights Act,” the National Republican Redistricting Trust said in a statement posted to X, which is formerly known as Twitter. “Despite Democrats’ best efforts to the contrary, the VRA is not a vehicle for maximizing partisan political power and never has been.”The 11th Circuit, which covers Georgia, ruled in a 1990 case out of Florida that the Voting Rights Act does protect coalition districts in some situations. But the U.S. Supreme Court has not weighed in. And an ongoing case out of Galveston, Texas, in the 5th Circuit — on which many legal watchers expect the Supreme Court may eventually weigh in — is also challenging the idea that the Voting Rights Act protects such districts.On Wednesday, Jones said challengers have until Dec. 12 to formally enter their objections to the new maps, with a hearing scheduled for Dec. 20.Should this new map be tossed out, a court-appointed special master would be appointed to draw new lines. Georgia Republicans would almost certainly appeal any court-drawn lines and have already appealed Jones’ earlier decision overturning the original maps.",6152,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/georgia-lucy-mcbath-district-00130621,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/692fc53/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffe%2F4f%2F4867c92d449a82f40e565687b60f%2Fhouse-of-representatives-40579.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,minority enter northeast send increase change brian share defy ongoing back id contrary kemp line maximize master intend seat divvied cover vowed remedy broad obama guarantee core vehicle jenkins described power draw shed appeal regularly entirely population subsequently vra rule effort address open constituent represent partisan email matter law put jones write told democratic remain formerly congressional legislative trust senate barack executive gov peach lucy wednesday file mccormick fundraise texas marina expense potential gubernatorial deadline political suburban violence current stand set toss appoint protects west sign twitter republican congress constituency idea politico shuffle candidate prolific split shred formally incumbent meaning fight map filing national original friday rich year immediately watcher resident voting declare post single act held weigh found racial fundraiser contend atlanta despite compose case strongly majority number appointee florida objection judge party enforce make section schedule special voter latino court possible city joint violate expect favor supreme opportunity direction x eliminate situation maintains mark support legal previous president tuesday violation lawmaker counter add gop part group mcbath black signal overturn week ethnic state serve wave decision control challenge redrawing destruction focus earlier affect federal protect include director percent run redistricting give circuit challenger georgia effectively coalition involve hold order thursday race statement washington additional house asian statewide float newly galveston prominent legislature dilute ultimately steve erase create assume election hearing eventually march attempt district notably pass currently area lawsuit activist democrat committee,0.97925,0.04876462938881664,11.72271808999082,0.43405920211475746,0
Politico,"Wind and solar pose climate threat too, oil giant Saudi Arabia argues",2023-12-07 05:00:00,Corbin Hiar,"Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is urging nations to take action on what it suggests is a growing threat to the Earth’s climate — wind and solar power.The pitch from the world’s biggest oil player includes a Saudi government document, obtained by POLITICO’s E&E News, expressing concern about the “lifecycle” greenhouse gas emissions of wind, solar and other renewable energy sources, whose popularity has grown as countries look for alternatives to planet-heating fossil fuels.It comes as the kingdom is stepping up its broader arguments that expensive, largely unproven methods of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and oceans are an essential part of the strategy for countering climate change. In contrast, scientists, environmental activists and representatives of vulnerable island nations say the most urgently needed fix for climate change is to stop producing and burning oil, natural gas and coal.Other major fossil fuel nations — including the United States — have also expressed support for a technological approach to reducing carbon pollution, in conjunction with shifting toward greener energy sources. But the Saudis have gone a step further by contending that carbon removal is also needed to address climate pollution from wind turbines, solar panels and other renewable energy hardware, according to text of a previously unreported speech scheduled before the COP28 climate summit began last week.“Renewables are an integral part of the solution,” a Saudi official was set to argue in the Oct. 31 closed-door speech to fellow diplomats, according to a copy of the prepared text. But the Saudi text added that “we must also act immediately to address their lifecycle emissions in the near term. This will require emissions removal.”Saudi Arabia’s U.S. embassy didn’t respond to questions about the document, which aligns with public statements that Saudi officials have made touting related technology that captures carbon from smokestacks. Advocates for more aggressive climate action say they worry that the kingdom is promoting efforts to manage carbon — and undercut renewables — in order to weaken support for weaning the world off of greenhouse-gas-spewing fossil fuels.“They’ve been at this for years and years and years,” Bill Hare, a climate science adviser to the Caribbean nation of Grenada, said of Saudi climate negotiators. “They come up with all sorts of ways to argue for delay, one way or the other. It’s another twist and turn in their delay playbook.”In addition, the Saudis’ argument about planet-warming emissions from the manufacturing and installation of renewable power are “totally exaggerated,” said Hare, who is also CEO of the European think tank Climate Analytics. Analyses of electricity from solar panels, for instance, have found it has a carbon footprint that’s a fraction of the size of coal-fired power.“In the end, the production systems for these technologies are getting cleaner,” Hare said. “So it’s not the overwhelming problem that they claim.”Hare said he worries that the rhetoric from Saudi Arabia and its allies will influence markets by sending a signal to the financial community that international support exists for these novel carbon technologies. That, in turn, could divert money and attention from proven measures for reducing demand for fossil fuels, such as new renewable energy projects and increased efficiency programs.“It would be a massive victory for those that want to delay action – and delay reducing oil, gas and coal,” Hare said.Saudi efforts to elevate carbon removal and capture technologies at this month’s talks in Dubai are happening as island nations and the European Union seek to build global support for phasing out the use of fossil fuels – the leading cause of climate change and the economic lifeblood of the kingdom. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said Monday that the country would oppose any COP28 text that calls for reducing global fossil fuel consumption.Saudi Arabia’s push to focus on limiting emissions rather than the fuels that produce them has been aided by the United Arab Emirates, the talks’ host nation, which selected its top oil executive to lead the negotiations.But for all their pronouncements, both oil-rich countries have made only minor investments in rolling out the emissions technologies, according to data compiled by the Global CCS Institute, a think tank that promotes carbon capture and storage installations. To skeptics, that raises questions about whether the petrostates are interested in carbon capture and removal as a climate solution — or as a convenient distraction.Carbon capture projects aim to minimize the climate damage caused by fossil-fuel-dependent facilities such as coal power plants and steel mills. Carbon removal technologies, by contrast, seek to reverse that harm by pulling already-released carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Energy analysts often lump the two under the broader umbrella of carbon management.While similar from an engineering perspective, the commercial and climate appeals of carbon capture and carbon removal are very different.The plummeting price of renewable energy has limited the potential of carbon capture for already-struggling coal plants, which are increasingly being replaced with wind or solar projects. Cheap renewable energy can also be used to create clean-burning hydrogen for steel makers. Meanwhile, carbon removal at a significant scale will be necessary to avoid the worst impacts of global warming, climate scientists have said, most recently on Sunday in a report to the U.N. on the dire state of the climate.Both types of climate technologies — carbon capture and carbon removal — have caught the eye of Saudi Arabia. The kingdom has been pitching those systems as a way to prevent the industrial-era rise in average global temperatures from surpassing 1.5 degree Celsius, the aspirational goal set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. At the same time, the Saudis have downplayed the need to ditch fossil fuels.“We must act immediately to tackle emissions from all sources, to keep 1.5 within reach, and not cherry pick one energy source over the other,” the Saudi Arabian official was prepared to say during the pre-COP28 meeting. The closed session, in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, was intended for diplomats to outline their national bargaining positions for the climate summit that began last Thursday.The document doesn’t name the Saudi official. But metadata associated with the file indicates that it was drafted by AlJawhara AlSudairy, the head of international negotiations and policy at the Saudi Ministry of Energy.When asked for comment, AlSudairy directed questions to the ministry, which didn’t respond to questions regarding who delivered the speech. It’s unclear whether the speech as written matches what was said in the room.In 2021, Saudi Arabia announced a program known as the Middle East Green Initiative that aims “to scale up carbon capture, invest in the green economy and encourage innovation and growth in renewables.” But the kingdom is starting from a very low base.The U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates that less than 1 percent of electricity in Saudi Arabia is generated from renewable sources. That’s not due to a lack of resources: The sun-drenched and windswept country has advertised to investors that it has among the highest potential for solar and wind energy development of any nation.Saudi Arabia also has no significant carbon removal facilities in operation or development, according to the Global CCS Institute.The kingdom has one carbon capture project online at a natural gas processing facility of Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, the Global CCS Institute said in its most recent annual report. The CO2 collected there is pumped underground to help produce more oil, limiting the project’s climate benefits. A much larger carbon capture hub is in “advanced development” and slated to come online in 2027, the institute said.Saudi Arabia has plenty of cash that it could invest into renewables or carbon removal or capture projects.With a valuation of more than $2.1 trillion, Saudi Aramco is the world’s third-largest publicly traded company, behind only the tech giants Apple and Microsoft. The state oil company reported earning $161 billion last year, the highest-ever recorded annual profit by a publicly listed firm.The International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental think tank, last month urged petrostates to quit pretending that carbon management efforts will enable them to keep the world hooked on hydrocarbons.“Oil and gas producers around the world need to make profound decisions about their future place in the global energy sector,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. “The industry needs to commit to genuinely helping the world meet its energy needs and climate goals — which means letting go of the illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution.”Yet in recent months, Saudi energy officials have been pursuing projects in Africa and Asia to increase oil and gas demand, according to an undercover investigation published last week by the Center for Climate Reporting and the United Kingdom’s Channel 4 News.Saudi Arabia didn’t respond to those outlets about the investigation. But in 2016 the country announced a plan to reduce its reliance on oil: Dubbed Vision 2030, the effort aims to grow the non-oil sector of its economy from less than 20 percent of gross domestic product to half of Saudi Arabia’s economic output by the end of the decade.At COP28, Saudi negotiators’ push to elevate carbon management has a key diplomatic ally: The UAE has also touted the potential for a type of carbon removal favored by the oil industry – at a time when the Emirates are planning to expand crude development.In July, the UAE submitted new climate goals to the United Nations climate agency that outlined its plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions 19 percent by 2030 from 2019 levels and reach net zero emissions by midcentury.As part of that plan, the Emirates will “explore innovative Direct Air Capture (DAC) solutions which extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere, which in the long term is critical to reach net zero emissions,” the UAE said in the UN filing. “To build up knowledge and expertise early on and support the UAE’s ambition of becoming a hub for low-carbon technology, the country will also start to pilot and implement DAC technology ahead of 2030.”Direct air capture facilities use fans, carbon-absorbing materials, electricity and heat to separate CO2 from ambient air. The pure stream of carbon can then be mixed with water and injected into reservoirs deep beneath the surface of the earth — a process that’s familiar to many oil and gas companies.The UAE has only one operating carbon capture facility and no direct air capture plants, according to the Global CCS Institute.Amid the flurry of publicity that’s accompanied COP28, the Emiratis have announced several carbon management projects. For instance, the UAE’s Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. and the U.S. firm Occidental Petroleum said in October that they would jointly fund an engineering study for a potential UAE direct air capture facility. The following month, ADNOC and the Australian oil producer Santos agreed to explore the potential for a carbon dioxide shipping and transportation network.But analysts from Climate Analytics and the NewClimate Institute, another European think tank, have raised questions about the UAE’s climate goals, noting that the country plans to spend $150 billion over the next five years on efforts that include expanding its oil and gas production capacity.“It is unclear how the UAE plans to reach its 2050 net zero emissions target,” the analysts said in a review of the Emiratis’ U.N. filing, which is known as a nationally determined contribution. “The UAE’s latest NDC mentions they plan to develop carbon capture and storage as well as direct air capture, but without specifying the scale of emissions reductions and removals this would represent.”The UAE’s U.S. embassy didn’t respond to a request for comment. But an Emirati official on Tuesday said the country’s support for carbon management efforts was driven by pragmatism.“I want to be clear that we aren’t promoting carbon capture to prolong the current energy system,” Majid Al Suwaidi, the director-general of COP28, told reporters in Dubai. “We are encouraging carbon management because the reality requires us to deal with the emissions system that we have, while we build the system we want.”The Emirates is not the first petrostate to boost carbon removal in its climate pledges.“Technological innovation and deployment at scale is the key to the Paris Agreement goals,” Saudi Arabia told the U.N. in 2021. “Deployment of and collaboration on the following technologies is crucial: carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), direct-air capture (DAC), clean hydrogen.”The following year, Bahrain submitted a climate goal that said it “supports key technologies such as carbon capture and utilization, direct air capture and others which are necessary for hard-to-abate sectors.”Bahrain has no carbon capture or direct air capture facilities in operation or development, Global CCS Institute data shows.Bahrain’s U.S. embassy did not respond to a request for comment.It’s too late in the climate crisis for world leaders to seriously entertain the “fantasy” that “it’s still possible to burn oil, and tackle climate change at the same time, through [carbon capture],” said Joanna Depledge, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge’s Center for Environment, Energy and Natural Resource Governance, in an email.After decades of obstruction by Saudi Arabia and other countries, “action to radically cut back on fossil fuel use is needed,” wrote Depledge, who previously worked for the U.N. climate agency. “Focusing on [carbon dioxide removal] is a dangerous distraction, and can only have a damaging impact on global efforts to keep temperatures at something approaching safe levels.”Karl Mathiesen contributed to this report from Brussels.

Politico,Blinken explains his reaction to Biden calling Xi a ‘dictator’,2023-12-07 10:45:00,Matt Berg,"After President Joe Biden again called Chinese leader Xi Jinping a “dictator” last month, a clip of Secretary of State Antony Blinken appearing to wince at the blunt remark immediately went viral.When asked about the moment on CNN’s “King Charles,” Blinken chuckled and gave a light-hearted excuse for his reaction.“I’m tempted to say that we’d had a really long day, a very important and intense conversation with China.

Politico,Trump’s ‘dictator’ remark puts 2024 campaign right where Biden wants it,2023-12-07 05:00:00,Jonathan Lemire,"Donald Trump keeps returning the 2024 presidential race to the ground where Joe Biden wants to fight it.After Trump told a Fox News town hall he would not be a dictator upon returning to office “other than Day One,” the Biden campaign pounced. It highlighted Trump’s remarks as another moment in which the GOP frontrunner showcased his undemocratic and dangerous plans for a possible second term.Biden has expressed his fear to confidants that Trump would have unchecked power if he were to return to office, according to three people granted anonymity to speak about private discussions. Trump would likely have at least one Republican-controlled chamber in Congress, a conservative Supreme Court, the allegiance of true-believer staff members and GOP state officials — and the knowledge he could be impeached twice and charged criminally in four jurisdictions and still claim power. He’d view that as a mandate, Biden has said privately, and abuse power at home and change how America is viewed abroad.All three people said the stakes have escalated in the president’s mind as he’s watched the Republican Party remain in Trump’s thrall despite Jan. 6 and the revelations about what his predecessor has in store for the future.“It’s coming back full circle — that in the president’s mind, this is the moral authority for the race. This is an existential threat. This is the reason he ran initially, and the reason — with Donald Trump running — he’s running again,” said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster for Biden’s campaign in 2020.“The president has always believed that it was his duty to get the nation beyond Trump,” said one of the three people close to him, who spoke with Biden about his views on Trump and was granted anonymity to speak about private discussions. “He had hoped 2020 would have done it but it didn’t. So he has to do it again.”Some Democrats have urged the reelection team to highlight other issues. This past weekend, a group of the party’s governors used its annual retreat to urge Biden to focus on issues like abortion, not Trump.But while the Biden camp will continue to draw issue-specific contrasts, the president himself has made clear he wants to frame the election ahead as a battle for democracy itself. The GOP frontrunner continues to provide ample opportunity for Biden to return to this familiar theme.This issue fueled Biden’s successful 2020 run, which he deemed “a battle for the soul of the nation.” And despite pushback from some Democrats, Biden leaned in hard again on that argument during last year’s midterms, warning that the extremist “MAGA Republicans” posed a threat to the republic’s foundation and rights.Biden’s candid remarks Tuesday at a string of Boston fundraisers both reflected another example of the president saying something unscripted that surprised staff but also a window into his true thinking, according to the three people close to him.“If Trump wasn’t running, I’m not sure I’d be running,” Biden said. “But we cannot let him win.”Biden then struck a grave tone, warning that he’s “running against an election-denier-in-chief,” who is “determined to destroy American democracy.”“Trump’s not even hiding the ball anymore,” Biden told the crowd. “He’s telling us exactly what he wants to do. He’s making no bones about it.”As early as 2021, Biden began having repeated conversations with allies that he would need to run again to prevent Trump from reclaiming the Oval Office. And like he did in 2020, Biden has steadfastly believed that he was the only Democrat who could beat him — though on Wednesday, he noted “probably 50” others in the party could beat Trump next year.“Folks have forgotten a lot of anxiety that they had about a second Trump term in 2020,” said Brandon Weathersby, the presidential communications director at American Bridge 21st Century, a top Dem super PAC. “And I believe as he continues to talk about his plans — and again, be very explicit about his plans to install an authoritarian regime — that does make it that much more salient for voters as we talk about it, and as we try to lay out the choice for voters in November.”Since declaring his candidacy in 2019, Biden has repeatedly touched on the idea that the nation’s democracy was under attack — and believed that voters would respond. His triumph in 2020 and the Democrats’ strong 2022 showing has validated that approach, his campaign believes. And Biden believes that he is the best candidate to deliver that message again next year.Trump’s latest remarks, Lake said, once again raised “the salience [of the issue], and whether [Trump] realizes it or not: America doesn’t want a dictator.”During the 2020 campaign, there was some idle chatter in Biden’s campaign of making a one-term pledge, becoming a “transitional” president who would rid the nation of Trump and then usher in a new era of Democratic leaders. But those ideas were dismissed even before Biden took the oath of office. And while Biden has never said so explicitly, many people around him believe he might have not sought reelection had Trump been off the playing field. But at this point on the calendar, Biden would almost certainly still run even if Trump suddenly bowed out, according to those close to him.After Trump’s town hall comment, the Biden campaign flooded social media with warnings and organized an event to bracket the GOP primary debate in Alabama that would include denouncements of the former president.“Democrats are gonna seize on this … the campaign immediately condemned the comments. The other groups that are working in concert to elect Democrats around the country have amplified this rhetoric as well,” said Weathersby. “These are Trump’s own words. I think you will continue to see more elevation of those words, and making clear that this is the choice — unless something drastic happens in the Republican primary — this person is going to be the Republican nominee.”",5926,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/trumps-dictator-2024-campaign-biden-00130488,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/a9f6500/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc3%2Fae%2Fa1ebf1744bed8171da25d65bf7c9%2Fbiden-21554.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country showcased initially raise ball reason lot respond alabama change top back return stake circle continue conversation argument threat pounce urge grave sought american charge touch thrall ahead bridge highlight close annual century criminally denouncement warn power draw hall moment strong chatter full abuse view explicit primary lay mandate ample day express celinda told democratic lean anymore remain america fox wednesday medium pose repeatedly biden forgotten begin deliver transitional accord pushback warning event probably undemocratic retreat prevent nation reelection late past weathersby crowd elevation concert private spoke dictator home authoritarian republican congress talk idea oval play privately extremist candidate escalate fight idle former remark candid mind string ran field year duty hard immediately unscripted beat claim nominee declare amplify brandon rhetoric member condemn explicitly clear fundraiser pledge official leader team despite reflect salience struck person social abortion unchecked lake folk repeat validate bow dangerous drastic jurisdiction gon attack foundation town party make soul camp voter realizes discussion ally revelation court allegiance possible pollster store boston early organize supreme opportunity plan successful weekend fear seize believe triumph work grant campaign destroy president determine surprised tuesday confidant gop comment governor group message candidacy presidential debate super term chamber ground hiding state trump elect salient knowledge democracy rid staff window anxiety note speak fuel word focus reclaim bracket suddenly include director pac install republic run contrast point frontrunner oath existential usher race familiar joe issue hop office flood authority regime conservative news provide show donald watch tone calendar election midterm steadfastly battle approach anonymity communication frame deem choice bone dismiss impeach predecessor democrat,0.59345,0.15187310158623016,8.589965635738832,0.4295407997020901,0
Politico,‘The Pain and the Trauma Lasts Longer Than a News Cycle’,2023-12-07 05:00:00,Myah Ward,"The NRA had a bad day on Sept. 22.That was the day President Joe Biden unveiled his new Office of Gun Violence Prevention, the first-ever White House office dedicated to the issue. Sitting in the Rose Garden for the announcement was Rob Wilcox, the initiative’s new deputy director who couldn’t help but think of a two-decade old quote from an NRA official crowing that the powerful gun group would have an office in the West Wing if George W. Bush was elected president.That never happened. Instead, seated between his kids and fellow deputy Greg Jackson was Wilcox — a longtime gun safety advocate — set to start his job inside the White House.But not long after, Wilcox had some bad days of his own.A month after the office’s unveiling, it had to respond to its first mass shooting, in Lewiston, Maine. Then another one in Chicago. They’re just two of the 630 mass shootings so far this year.“The gun violence that is happening is unacceptable,” Wilcox said in an interview with POLITICO Magazine. “The truth is that we have a lot of ground to make up.”Biden can claim credit for signing the first gun safety law in nearly 30 years and has issued a slew of executive orders, but he’s also been criticized by progressives for not doing more. The new White House office was a long-sought goal of gun safety activists, who were eager for further action from the administration, particularly with new legislation all but doomed in Congress amid Republican resistance.Despite the ongoing carnage, including a tragedy that hit Wilcox’s own family, he remains optimistic that America can tackle this growing crisis. And he made the case that the federal government is building new systems right now that might actually stem the bloodshed.“Gun violence is rooted in heartbreak,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s rooted in hopelessness.”This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Your office’s name includes the word “prevention.” Did you expect that responding to, rather than preventing, mass shootings would play such a big role in your job?The president gave us four clear tasks: The first is to expedite the implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the previous executive actions. The second is to identify new executive actions that we can take to reduce gun violence. A third is to expand the coalition of partners that we work with to get more state and local action. And then the fourth is to improve the support for our communities and individuals impacted by gun violence.And it’s not just mass shootings, it’s concentrations and surges in gun violence. And so was I surprised? No, absolutely not. But my fellow deputy, Greg Jackson, had been working on developing the first-ever, whole-of-government response to gun violence when it occurs even before that shooting [in Lewiston] and so he was well prepared to lead the largest federal response ever to an act of gun violence.And that’s a system for how federal agencies can jump into action in the event of another shooting?Exactly. Since we knew this was our job from the jump, we had already worked with the agencies to begin to understand what potential resources they could bring to bear to respond to gun violence. When that tragedy happened in Lewiston, we were just forced into action. That system only gets perfected over time, especially as we look back at lessons learned. We hear more about needs, and we develop a real comprehensive response plan.The thing that we know is that no shooting is the same. Part of the art of the challenge is not to apply a cookie cutter formula to every incident, but to be thorough with the tools that could be brought to bear so we can be adaptable to what the situation demands.Do you have specific examples of what this looked like in Lewiston?My fellow deputy was on the ground within a couple of days — there was obviously a delay since it was an ongoing [manhunt]. We were able to bring multiple agencies to the scene so that we could support the kids that are going back to school and the principals that are dealing with the fallout; the Veterans Affairs Department working with the veterans community; directly addressing the needs of the deaf community, which was specifically impacted in this shooting; and working with the Chamber of Commerce on support for small businesses.We really were bringing federal resources to bear in a coordinated fashion that just never had been activated like this before.Is there anything that you learned from this response?Look, I think the things that we learned are some of the things that Greg and I have always known. The pain and the trauma lasts longer than a news cycle. Families of individuals who are shot live with that the rest of their lives. Parents that lose children will never recover. And communities live with that reverberation of trauma for years and years, if not their entire lives.What we’ve been able to bring is that perspective to this office, so that the systems that we put in place and the interventions that we support are meant for healing and helping those that are closest to this pain. And it’s not just about mass shootings. It’s about gun violence in all its forms, about domestic violence, about community violence. It’s about suicide. It’s about accidental shootings.How does your office play a role in coming up with new ideas for executive actions, and should we expect any new policy moves soon?Yeah, we’ve been working around the clock, and there is so much support in this administration for taking action. Our job is about focusing the efforts of this administration. There are several offices and dozens of agencies that all have specific pieces to address this problem. But the issue is, when you have multiple people attacking the same issue, you can see silos. You can see things happening in parallel, but not with strategic coordination. And so we are a dedicated office that acts as that coordinator.Both you and Jackson bring experience as not only advocates, but as survivors of gun violence. How has this informed your work?For example, when it came to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we knew that one of the purposes was to implement extreme risk protection order laws and red flag laws. We could dive in and immediately assess the progress in terms of where that funding was and how it was getting to the states. And we convened the states very quickly, to encourage them to get their plans in so that they can begin accessing this money and spending it on the implementation of these red flag laws. Because at the end of the day, we know that these are the types of laws that can save lives because after way too many of these incidents everyone’s saying, “I saw the flag.”That’s literally the reason my cousin isn’t here today. The man who killed her was in the middle of a mental health crisis that his brother wanted to take action on. He tried some things, but there was no tool at that time to get the guns out of his brother’s hands, even though he wanted to. So that guy walked into the mental health hospital where my cousin was just volunteering for winter break from Haverford College and he shot and killed her and others.I still today can picture the funeral. I can see where people were sitting. And you want to do something. You want to do something not just for your family, but the families that you don’t even know yet.There’s obviously a lot of push and pull between policymakers and advocates. Have you disappointed any former colleagues yet in the advocacy world?You’d have to ask them if they’re disappointed. Look, there’s no time for grace. There’s only time for the urgency of action. And I think people see that that’s how Greg and I move and that we are here to put in all the work and they know the reasons why we do it. And so I think we welcome all the ideas. We’re not shy, to say bring us the best ideas.What’s been the biggest challenge?The biggest challenge we face is that gun violence has continued. Some of the solutions that have been put in place are beginning to make a difference, and we’re seeing reductions in violent crime and homicide in our cities across this country.But we still know that the gun violence that is happening is unacceptable, and the president has told us as much — that it doesn’t matter that we passed the first law in 30 years. It doesn’t matter that this administration has taken more executive actions than every other administration combined. What matters is that this gun violence is happening everyday. So I think that the challenge is that we don’t have a minute to spare.A lot of people are losing hope. Many are scared to send their kids to school. What would you say to Americans who feel like gun violence is never going to end?The truth is that we have a lot of ground to make up. We’ve had years of underinvestment in the community-based organizations that are doing the hard work on the ground, to intervene and stop violence before it starts — six years where the leading federal agency to enforce our gun laws was without a confirmed director. And we were 30 years from the last time that we had any advancement in our gun safety laws. So we’re just getting started at putting all those pieces into play.Gun violence is rooted in heartbreak. But that doesn’t mean it’s rooted in hopelessness. In fact, it’s the opposite. And the truth is the 20 years I’ve been involved in this prove that to me. The NRA thought they were going to work out of the West Wing. Twenty years later, we’ve established the first ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.And in 2013, after a tragedy that captured the nation’s attention, we only got 54 votes in the U.S. Senate for a background check policy. And in 2022, after another tragedy at a school and a tragedy in Buffalo, we saw 65 votes in the U.S. Senate for a bill that included multiple interventions, not just when it comes to gun laws, but in mental health.I see survivors and students and young people leading on this issue in ways they never had before. And so, I’m filled with hope.",10062,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/12/07/biden-war-room-gun-violence-00130414,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/3b15a8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5598x3732+0+0/resize/1290x860!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F03%2Fc2%2F4c01b8e14aeb9d3127451f588ffe%2Fap23313842151471.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,funding reason lot survivor length dozen respond send chicago response ongoing quote back minute eager cousin conversation pull seat coordinate unacceptable strategic bear mass remains buffalo develop greg american stop improve long encourage continued lose reverberation large wilcox agency type silo reduce interview happen reduction perspective stem deputy deaf effort address urgency system brother matter powerful start law put deal day cutter adaptable amid advancement unveil meant told funeral particularly suicide multiple heartbreak learn edit america senate executive child push crime school expand root bill resource colleague volunteer department biden dedicate twenty begin partner fashion local move implementation live event establish prevent potential nation role small commerce signing experience homicide tackle violence mental shooting legislation set break student red west rob combine george scene action republican congress idea background form advocate play young politico confirm safety knew life former absolutely picture credit bring opposite affair year gun expedite shoot formula comprehensive immediately hard claim understand activate specifically act clock inform clear advocacy difference official rest middle inside prepared quickly dive recover case closest kill convene accidental attack enforce surge force manhunt make hear spending parallel cycle hand unveiled city slew policy administration college wing expect flag crisis instead lesson haverford access plan family situation winter announcement work safer jump support implement fellow previous surprised president heal directly concentration month job intervene progress fallout part group walk extreme criticize purpose building term chamber incident goal ground lead fourth coordination check garden fact state risk policymakers place doom grace delay elect task identify protection challenge prevention save feel big carnage progressive shy parent occurs entire word focus piece vote federal include grow trauma director hospital perfect specific welcome veteran real tool attention impact government give couple money initiative lewiston jackson world prove longer individual solution ass health tragedy coalition involve order time bipartisan joe brought issue hit bush house guy pain office art especially domestic shot truth violent today news problem underinvestment apply principal nra intervention optimistic crow hope fill white magazine literally capture rise cookie scar hopelessness kid community longtime everyday pass organization activist disappointed,-0.9883,0.2683363148479428,7.5263053207359505,0.38751101405968663,0
Politico,A China brawl looms for House Republicans,2023-12-07 10:49:00,Zachary Warmbrodt,"Republican lawmakers are trying to come together on China policy, after an internal feud derailed investment restrictions from riding on this year’s must-pass defense bill.It’s far from a slam dunk, according to GOP lawmakers and aides.The rift is revealing deep tensions between national security and economic priorities when it comes to implementing a policy objective that many Republicans will be running on this year: curtailing China’s global influence.The stakes are high for the business community.House China hawks, led by Foreign Affairs Chair Michael McCaul (R-Texas), are confident they have the upper hand with legislation that would try to curb capital flowing from the U.S. into certain sectors of China’s economy, including AI and quantum computing. They’re facing off with Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and top Republicans on his committee, who want to instead use company-specific sanctions.McHenry and his deputies warn that a new kind of government crackdown on U.S. investment in China could end up hurting Western influence.McCaul and McHenry are working with House leadership on negotiating a compromise early next year. McCaul said in an interview that Republicans are looking at a hybrid approach that could include sanctions and a prohibition to invest in certain sectors. But he left open the possibility that the sides may be irreconcilable.McCaul said his version, which is backed by outside conservative groups and has support from Democrats, could probably sail through the House. It’s also backed by Sen. John Cornyn, a fellow Texas Republican who’s been driving the issue across the Capitol.“If there’s a way to do this, we will,” McCaul said of the compromise talks. “If it becomes problematic, another option is we could put our separate bills on the floor separately.”McCaul boiled down the rift like this: “My approach is more China-hawkish. It’s more national security-focused and based, where Patrick’s — I’ll let him define his bill — but I see it as more of a Wall Street approach.”McHenry responded in a statement: “We need a solution that cuts off revenue for the CCP’s military-industrial complex without kneecapping one of our greatest strategic assets — our capital markets.”Rep. Andy Barr, who drafted the sanctions bill and sits on both Foreign Affairs and Financial Services, said in an interview that his entity-based approach “is what the private sector deserves and needs.” (Although, some in industry also have concerns about the impacts of Barr’s bill.)“They need a red-light, green-light approach,” Barr said. “Something that provides them with certainty and clarity unlike a broad, sector-based approach or reverse-CFIUS that risks creating a new bureaucracy that would regulate Americans’ investments abroad.” (CFIUS, or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, is an inter-agency group that polices foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses for national security concerns.)McHenry, who is retiring from Congress at the end of his term, said he’s committed to working with House colleagues on legislation that uses sanctions and export controls. But he also signaled he has limits.“This is an important debate that Congress must have, but our arguments should be rooted in policy, not platitudes,” he said. “We can all say we’re tough on China, but at the end of the day if your approach advances Xi Jinping’s own goal of targeting Western investment in Chinese companies, I wouldn’t put my name on that.”",3497,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/china-house-republicans-00130587,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/11e4299/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F19%2Fe6%2F634f514c4fcbabeff5f3da9d5e57%2Fhouse-of-representatives-30241.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police leadership respond hybrid top back upper stake argument regulate mccaul retire dunk strategic tension broad kind side version american drive service economic warn define interview western deputy china deserves company open curtail draft put day crackdown hurt clarity root bill possibility financial colleague global accord rep derail john texas quantum probably capital acquisition bureaucracy reveal floor rift advance legislation patrick private cornyn sits republican complex hawk talk congress sail prohibition wall national confident flow affair year problematic michael compute export platitude unlike defense curb negotiate ccp mchenry xi hand internal policy foreign tough objective early concern instead united industry commit work option implement support fellow jinping chair investment lawmaker economy gop group revenue debate signal boil base certainty term goal lead feud cfius state risk priority street barr control high rid sector slam include important run impact government left solution restriction chinese cut statement issue asset invest house deep conservative target sanction provide create compromise andy kneecap approach business separate security great democrat committee,0.94905,0.0,10.042983257229832,0.36392865732151447,0
Politico,Rick Santorum is back — the ‘patron saint’ of every 2024 long-shot campaign,2023-12-07 05:00:00,Adam Wren,"Rick Santorum’s ears are burning.The 2012 Republican presidential candidate who surged from single digits in November of 2011 to win the Iowa caucuses the following January is back in the conversation in the first caucus state.The press is calling. He’s covering the caucuses as an analyst for Newsmax. His 2012 magic act has also been mentioned in no fewer than four Des Moines Register pieces about the caucuses in recent weeks. Advisers to Vivek Ramaswamy and Mike Pence, before he dropped out, have invoked his name publicly. And, according to Santorum, at least two campaigns have reached out to him within the last few weeks for advice.Santorum declined to say which campaigns they were. But in a primary defined by its low-polling also-rans, calling the former Pennsylvania senator would make sense.“I’m the patron saint of all these guys who are looking for a longshot win, which is great,” said Santorum.In a campaign where all of Donald Trump’s opponents are scrambling for evidence that they have a shot of overcoming his enormous lead, Santorum is a proof point. But the fact other candidates and their supporters bring him up is also a sign of just how desperate the race has become — with Trump’s rivals relying on a pre-Trump mindset of how politics works, back when the GOP did not revolve around a Trumpian gravitational pull.“That was back when we all subscribed to this lane theory of politics, which Trump has sort of abandoned,,” said David Kochel, who has worked on multiple presidential campaigns in Iowa. Now, he said, the primary “has to do with personality and celebrity. He is the axis around which voters determine who they are.”The outlines of Santorum’s unlikely victory are remarkable. In the lead-up to that year’s caucuses, Santorum ran just $23,000 worth of television ads. Much of his victory is credited to the385 town halls and speeches he gave while traveling the state’s highways in a silver 2006 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup named “Chuck Truck,” after his Iowa aide Chuck Laudner.Nearly twelve years later, you can still detect the hard edges of bitterness in Santorum’s voice as he talks about his effort.“The story that you guys have never told, nor do I think you have any interest in telling — you certainly didn’t then — was some guy who lost his Senate race by 18 percent six years before the caucus, and went to Iowa in a truck and car all by himself and campaigned all over the state and spent less than a million dollars the entire campaign, and won the Iowa caucuses,” said Santorum, the buttoned-down conservative father of seven children. “Candidly, if I was a Democrat, I would be a hero in national politics. But because I am who I am, nobody ever knows that.”Santorum recalls attending lonely events where just one caucus goer showed up — not much different from the crowds Doug Burgum and Asa Hutchinson are drawing now. Once, he trekked to a GOP headquarters in Montgomery County, in the southwestern corner of the state, where only the county party chair, Margaret Stoldorf, showed up. Thirty awkward minutes later, Stoldorf shuttled him to the nearby courthouse, introducing him around.“It turned out that Margaret, who was not a supporter of mine that morning, became a supporter of mine, and we won Montgomery County,” Santorum said, realizing he didn’t need mega political rallies to win but just the right person to hear his message, and carry it elsewhere.Santorum’s win is mostly forgotten because the result wasn’t immediately clear in the hours and days after the caucuses. Initially, Mitt Romney appeared to have won by eight votes. Some two weeks later, the Iowa GOP declared Santorum the winner. And, of course, he didn’t win his party’s nomination. “In order to clarify conflicting reports and to affirm the results released January 18 by the Republican Party of Iowa, Chairman Matthew Strawn and the State Central Committee declared Senator Rick Santorum the winner of the 2012 Iowa Caucus,” the state GOP’s statement read at the time.Fast forward more than a decade, and a number of non-Trump campaigns are trying to emulate his approach. Vivek Ramaswamy, the wealthy biotech entrepreneur, has said he’ll do at least another 200 Iowa events before the caucuses. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday notched stops in each of Iowa’s 99 counties. Doug Burgum, the wealthy governor of North Dakota, is criss-crossing the state, too.And campaigns are not only copying his example. They are invoking Santorum explicitly as evidence they have a shot. Senior officials from sputtering campaigns ranging from Ramaswamy’s to Mike Pence’s this year have all pointed to his come-from-behind victory as reason to believe, even as candidates not named Donald Trump languish 30 points or more behind the frontrunner.“I always say that the real caucus and primary sprint doesn’t happen until after Thanksgiving. That’s just the way it’s always been,” said Mike Biundo, a senior adviser to Ramaswamy, who also served as a top aide to Santorum in 2012. “Rick Santorum was sitting at around 3 percent at this time.”“Recall, Rick Santorum was at 5 percent in 2011,” Marc Short, a Pence senior adviser told reporters in the spin room following the Reagan Library Debate in Simi Valley, Calif., in September, attempting to explain away Pence’s low polling less than a month before his candidate would drop out.Before the primary began — before it became clear that so many longshots would need a Santorum-like miracle in Iowa — Santorum says just one candidate in the 2024 field asked him for his opinion on the race: Pence, whose six-month campaign also leaned heavily on Iowa and hoped to replicate Santorum’s success. (Santorum said he advised Pence not to run: “Mike’s a really fine guy, and he’s a good friend. I just didn’t think this was the time for him to run. And I encouraged him to let this election pass.”)That Santorum’s caucus victory is now getting more air is somewhat ironic. It happens, of course, in a year when Trump has so dominated the field that any jockeying in Iowa seems to be about who will finish second or third behind him. And ultimately, Santorum dropped out in April, before his home state of Pennsylvania voted. He did not win his party’s nomination; Romney did that.At the moment, Santorum thinks Trump is going to win Iowa. But he doesn’t think it’s impossible that someone will catch him.“If someone can catch fire at the end, there’s a chance for that landslide type of activity that I experienced,” he said, while en route back to Iowa for his role as a grassroots adviser to the Convention of the States, which champions an Article V gathering of the states to enact changes to the Constitution.“I always say that I’m somewhat responsible for these huge Republican fields,” Santorum says, “because these guys say, ‘if Santorum can do it, anybody can.’”",6837,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/rick-santorum-is-back-the-patron-saint-of-every-2024-longshot-campaign-00130558,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/725e0db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3367x2160+0+0/resize/630x404!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe5%2F73%2F09c8fe6e4b9b99f0fa908a6d238f%2Fmedia-cnn-santorum-95284.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,biotech proof initially reason mindset dakota november change top short opinion simi back minute win winner huge conversation catch fire cover caucus burgum pickup stop advise opponent encourage headquarters lose thanksgiving sort type draw hall define margaret moment senior happen nomination mike marc primary personality thirty doug vivek romney politics corner strawn mention rely day reagan adviser miracle responsible mega senator told chairman course lean decade library multiple release senate ear outline child polling saint matthew gov april reach travel lonely affirm room saturday spin experienced celebrity landslide story bitterness route explain realize carry forgotten notch reporter begin moines evidence santorum rick accord heavily shuttle event lane grassroots stoldorf aide kochel role political drop crowd ron digit highway iowa million home north television sign republican finish talk candidate truck turn national register former press credit bring ran field year hard immediately spent supporter declare detect away follow single act attend enormous result explicitly report clear wealthy january introduce official interest desperate september central person dollar candidly speech nearby hutchinson trumpian morning number florida chance range town party surge make hear convention voter abandon forward victory longshot twelve sprint copying awkward air patron recent gathering entrepreneur hour penny success believe work county friend campaign determine chair article month valley enact analyst different gop newsmax emulate publicly axis governor message replicate david hero presidential debate dodge subscribed rival week lead fact goer state trump jockeying serve low worth overcome biundo decline remarkable languish car scramble invoked southwestern magic entire piece vote champion trekked percent activity clarify run real point give montgomery father impossible recall order time race statement hop guy voice pennsylvania shot conservative desantis show donald ram ultimately fine rally election chuck dominate theory sputter gravitational conflict invoke ramaswamy approach ironic courthouse edge attempt great read revolve silver call democrat committee,0.9939,0.04387889425186485,7.800581818181815,0.43024099883855965,0
Politico,"CNN plans unsanctioned GOP debates in Iowa, New Hampshire",2023-12-07 13:11:00,Natalie Allison,"CNN announced Thursday it will host Republican presidential candidate debates before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary next month — throwing a wrench into a process that thus far has been managed exclusively by the Republican National Committee.The respective debates, set for Jan. 10 in Des Moines and Jan. 21 just outside Manchester, aren’t sanctioned by the RNC, which has organized the first four debates, including Wednesday night’s broadcast in Alabama.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signaled almost immediately that he intends to appear at CNN’s Iowa debate. Other candidates have yet to say if they will participate.Campaigns have continuously complained about current RNC rules, which say a candidate who participates in an unsanctioned debate is barred from future RNC-approved gatherings. But the RNC’s debate committee is expected to meet Friday to discuss officially removing that rule, according to three people with knowledge of the group’s plans.DeSantis on multiple occasions in the last month spoke out against the RNC’s restrictions, accusing the party of “doing the bidding of” Donald Trump by actively limiting candidates’ opportunities to face each other in a variety of settings. Trump has not appeared at any of the four RNC-sponsored debates this year.The committee last month initially tried to forbid the candidates from participating in a roundtable held by a prominent Iowa evangelical Christian group, The Family Leader, but relented after pushback from the campaigns and allied organizations.In October, Vivek Ramaswamy and Chris Christie were barred by the committee from debating each other on Fox News Channel, forcing the cable network to instead schedule two separate forums for the candidates.Ramaswamy, who previously called for the fifth debate to be aired exclusively on the social media website X, rather than cable or broadcast television, described the RNC’s rules as being part of a “brokered and rigged nomination process.” Christie, too, slammed the committee this fall for its restrictions on outside debates.But CNN’s announcement of 2024 debates came before any decision was made by the RNC, a sign that the cable network may be angling to get ahead of other news outlets that are also planning early-state debates in the wake of the RNC’s rule change.A press release published on CNN’s website said the RNC “is expected to announce this week it will release candidates from its requirement that prevents them from participating in non-RNC-sanctioned debates.”POLITICO reported earlier this week that ABC News was also preparing for a debate before the New Hampshire primary. Historically, the network has worked with its Manchester affiliate, WMUR-TV, on a New Hampshire debate in the days leading up to the primary.CNN’s criteria for extending invitations to the candidates will also be stricter than the RNC’s rules so far. Candidates need to earn 10 percent in pre-approved polls — both nationally and in the two earliest states on the GOP presidential calendar — to secure an invite.According to POLITICO’s analysis, DeSantis, Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would be invited to the Iowa debate. Qualification for that one concludes on Jan. 2.For the New Hampshire debate, just Trump and Haley have met CNN’s polling criteria so far. But the network will also invite the top three finishers in the Jan. 15 Iowa caucuses; DeSantis, who lags in New Hampshire polling compared to his standing nationally and in Iowa, is in second place in Iowa polling averages.Neither Christie nor Ramaswamy has met CNN’s criteria for either debate, according to POLITICO’s analysis.Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.",3683,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/cnn-debates-iowa-nh-00130650,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/c2cb40a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4896x3264+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe3%2F97%2Fc51d686043539a162c5861f39262%2Felection-2024-debate-58616.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,initially fall social meet prevents top manage outlet channel intend caucus party force requirement make setting finisher discus schedule forum ahead planning wrench analysis haley described contribute expect invitation early organize air network instead opportunity roundtable limit participates compare broadcast family exclusively x rule gathering nomination secure announcement primary continuously work stricter vivek campaign chris month cable unsanctioned christie concludes gop part day group abc debate presidential signal cnn multiple release lead actively week gov relent poll state participate nikki trump remove place fox manchester host wednesday occasion medium knowledge decision rnc allied moines accord pushback slam earlier future process invite include criterion percent forbid extend throw angle historically earn ron october polling previously night current hampshire evangelical stand broker set spoke mcgraw iowa variety announce restriction television sign prepare thursday republican respective wake carolina bar candidate politico affiliate desantis news bidding sanction prominent rig donald national website qualification accuse press former friday calendar christian immediately publish lag ramaswamy south nationally held separate officially report call complain leader committee,0.75635,0.1629106706489275,11.8872,0.35244318181818185,0
Politico,Trump seeks halt to D.C. criminal case,2023-12-07 13:49:00,Josh Gerstein,"Donald Trump is demanding that a judge halt all proceedings in the federal criminal case charging him with trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election.Trump contends that U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan no longer has power over the case while he appeals her ruling that Trump is not immune from the charges he’s facing — a process that could take weeks or months. In the meantime, he says, Chutkan must postpone all deadlines and cede her authority over the matter.Citing “political costs to President Trump and this country” if the case were to move forward, Trump’s lawyers argued Thursday that he’s entitled to an “automatic stay” while he appeals Chutkan’s ruling last week.If Chutkan accedes to the demand, it could jeopardize her plan to begin the trial of the former president on March 4 at a Washington courthouse just blocks from the Capitol his supporters attacked on Jan. 6, 2021.Trump is appealing Chutkan’s order denying his claim that he enjoys immunity from prosecution on the election-related charges by virtue of the fact he was serving as president at the time. The order also turned down his argument that he can’t be prosecuted because he was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate for his conduct related to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6.“The filing of President Trump’s notice of appeal has deprived this Court of jurisdiction over this case in its entirety pending resolution of the appeal,” Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and John Lauro wrote. “Therefore, a stay of all further proceedings is mandatory and automatic.”Trump’s attorneys indicated that even if Chutkan doesn’t grant the stay, they plan to ask the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to do so and intend to operate as if there is one in place. That could be consequential in a case that is expected to be just three months away from trial. Prospective jurors have already begun receiving initial notices from the courthouse.The lawyers said that unless Chutkan rules otherwise, they plan to ignore upcoming deadlines in the case regarding pretrial motions, exchanges of information with prosecutors and designation of expert witnesses.Trump’s legal team said in its 11-page filing that prosecutors from special counsel Jack Smith’s office have indicated they plan to oppose the stay.Trump’s lawyers noted that prosecutors have acknowledged that Trump can’t be forced to go to trial in the case while an immunity appeal is pending. But according to Trump’s lawyers, the prosecutors appeared to seek to leave the door open to pretrial proceedings such as motions, hearings and trial planning in the coming months.Trump’s attorneys rejected that approach, arguing that the former president is entitled to avoid “the burdens of litigation” while his appeal goes forward, including the impact on his ongoing campaign for reelection to the presidency.“Concerns regarding judicial resources and costs from continued litigation during the pendency of the appeal — including financial, reputational, and political costs to President Trump and this country — are significant,” Blanche and Lauro wrote.A spokesperson for Smith’s office declined to comment Thursday.",3156,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/trump-seeks-halt-to-d-c-criminal-case-00130662,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/f056bea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4708x3139+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F9a%2Fa2%2F6561efde4a56ba36d446343d2403%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1683732924,Law and Justice,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country prospective motion judicial criminal case ongoing operate argument ruling intend todd jurisdiction immune postpone attack judge force prosecutor stay expert special trial charge planning court subvert forward continued exchange expect enjoys jeopardize concern entitle appeal power smith lawyer plan argue rule consequential leave proceeding grant legal campaign pendency blanche president designation open month regard receive attorney jack comment accedes acquit write presidential prosecution pretrial cost demand immunity senate week fact trump ignore serve place reputational resource seek avoid financial decline begin deny mandatory move note accord process john federal information include entirety deadline reelection political pending impact circuit meantime chutkan significant virtue longer juror indicate conduct notice thursday order time team capitol automatic washington litigation house upcoming initial office authority contends burden cede donald turn prosecute filing former halt oppose block claim supporter hearing acknowledge march away approach related courthouse lauro district resolution spokesperson counsel reject riot impeach deprive,-0.9745999999999999,0.0,10.928208695652174,0.30273600668337514,0
Politico,Vivek Ramaswamy continues tirade post-debate,2023-12-07 13:08:00,Kierra Frazier,"Vivek Ramaswamy again went on the offensive during Wednesday night’s GOP presidential debate, and in interviews afterward he’s shown no sign of slowing down.In an explosive “Fox & Friends” appearance Thursday morning, Ramaswamy sparred with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade over the candidate’s stance that Ukraine should accept a peace deal in their war with Russia.Kilmeade called Ramaswamy naïve for his position on Ukraine, to which Ramaswamy responded with “Brian, if I called Nikki Haley naïve, you guys would be having a conniption. Let’s be honest about that. But you want to call me naïve? I actually understand what the heck I’m talking about.”Kilmeade continued to press Ramaswamy in the nearly 5-minute-long exchange. At one point, Fox co-host Ainsley Earhardt tried to wrap up the debate by murmuring “alright,” but Ramaswamy and Kilmeade continued to go back and forth.In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Wednesday night, Ramaswamy doubled down on some of the conspiracy theories he listed his support for during the debate: that Jan. 6 was an “inside job,” that the government lied to Americans about Saudi Arabia’s involvement in 9/11, the validity of the great replacement theory and that the 2020 election was stolen by “Big Tech.”“I was an anti-woke crusader leaving the business world and if you had asked me three years ago, Is there some chance January 6th is an inside job?, I would’ve said that was crazy talk,” Ramaswamy said Wednesday. “I would say looking at the facts of the video footage that have come out, Dana, it is shocking that you still haven’t gotten a clear answer on how many federal agents were in the field that day.”Congressional investigations have long rebutted the Jan. 6 claim made by Ramaswamy.Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in his own interview Thursday morning compared Ramaswamy’s debate behavior to that of a “drunk driver.”“He’s like a drunk driver on the debate stage,” Christie said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “I mean, this is a guy who you never know where he is going to go, what he is going to make up next, what lane he is going to swerve into.”",2109,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/vivek-ramaswamy-debate-2024-00130613,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,slow inside behavior steal respond brian double investigation back arabia morning chance replacement saudi appearance make american swerve long continued exchange naïve haley kilmeade agent bash jersey heck interview compare validity leave honest ainsley vivek support friend chris rebut job christie gop deal conniption offensive debate presidential cnn earhardt congressional nikki fact gov fox wednesday host stance wrap afterward conspiracy murmur alright big position federal crusader lane video dana crazy point stage government night world footage answer involvement explosive sign thursday talk candidate guy spar driver news peace ago show msnbc press accept election year field list drunk theory understand claim shock ukraine ramaswamy business great clear call january lie,0.1477,0.7112375533428165,7.621481481481478,0.5480148709315377,0
Politico,"Gaza hostage talks hit roadblock, raising fears of prolonged captivity",2023-12-07 16:08:00,Erin Banco,"Talks to release the remaining hostages in Gaza have hit a stalemate in recent days, dashing hopes of U.S. officials that they might reach a deal by the end of the year, according to two senior U.S. officials.More than 130 hostages are still being held inside Gaza. There are several factors complicating negotiations, the officials said.Hamas’s leaders, many of whom live in Doha, are increasingly unable to communicate with and control the actions of their fighters in Gaza. And recent allegations that Hamas has sexually abused the hostages has added to the tensions around the negotiations. In addition, the U.S. and Israel are still unable to locate all of the hostages and determine whether they are still alive, the officials said. All were granted anonymity to discuss ongoing, sensitive negotiations.Combined, the obstacles have stalled the negotiations, meaning the release of the hostages will likely happen much more slowly than the U.S. originally anticipated.The original hostage deal lasted eight days and led to the release of 110 hostages and 250 Palestinian prisoners. But U.S. and Israeli officials have said that the deal broke down when Hamas refused to provide a list of women and children that were set to be released.Despite that setback, the Biden administration had hoped to reach another agreement for the release of the remaining hostages and another pause in fighting before Israel began its offensive in southern Gaza. Even if the fighting resumed, Washington hoped it could help broker a deal before Jan. 1, the officials said.That is looking less and less likely. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters in a briefing Thursday that the administration is “not close to inking a deal” for a pause in fighting and release of hostages.The officials stressed that conversations are still ongoing and that the situation could improve in the coming days, especially if Hamas agrees to release the female hostages.Officials from the U.S. intelligence community, the White House and the State Department have spent the past week pushing for a new deal with leaders in Qatar, Egypt and Israel without making much headway.CIA Director Bill Burns had traveled to Doha to meet with intelligence officials from Israel and Egypt as well as the Qatari prime minister. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke with the prime minister.The refusal to provide the list of women and children was the first roadblock, one of the officials said, leading to a breakdown in communications with Hamas.Renewed fighting in southern Gaza and accusations by the U.S. and Israel that Hamas leaders are abusing the female hostages sexually are further straining talks, the officials said.“It is a sick truth of this particular group that they use sexual violence as a weapon and a tool,” Kirby said in another briefing Wednesday. “Sadly, I think it’s safe to assume that they’re still using sexual violence as a weapon, but I can’t speak to specific cases.”State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday that Hamas does not “want these women to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in custody.”The IDF appears to be distancing itself from such statements. “Following some comments aired in the last day on the topic of the hostages in Gaza, the discourse on the topic is irresponsible, inaccurate and it should be avoided,” the IDF said in a statement released Wednesday.U.S. officials have said that they are still working on gathering additional information about the remaining hostages, including whether they need medical attention.“The truth is we don’t know a lot,” Kirby said. “If we could get Red Cross access to them … it would help give us some information.”Meanwhile, Hamas leaders in Doha and the fighters in Gaza aren’t always in agreement about strategy.“The Gaza military guys are calling their own shots,” a third senior administration official said. “They don’t always listen to the political leadership elsewhere.”The Biden administration plans to continue talking with Israel, Qatar and Egypt, including at the Doha Forum next week. Roger Carstens, the administration’s hostage envoy, will be at the Doha gathering, but his trip had been planned before the Gaza war, a State Department spokesperson said, declining to offer further detail.Nahal Toosi and Alex Ward contributed to this report.",4385,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/gaza-hostage-talks-roadblock-00130688,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/9ab15ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x2133+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fee%2F15%2F6fcbc9d74892950ad9d3f43ded7a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1831275058,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,allegation leadership lot ongoing doha kirby continue conversation broke tension addition strain weapon discus forum improve close accusation contribute senior happen hostage slowly prisoner abuse sensitive miller antony fighter female offer deal day roadblock told unable remain release child push matthew reach topic travel bill wednesday avoid department biden begin reporter toosi increasingly accord prime cross john information live particular originally military past stall listen political gaza southern violence roger set spoke secretary red action talk ink israeli locate meaning national fight sexual original year stalemate spent palestinian breakdown follow burn held report spokesperson negotiation official leader communicate inside inaccurate meet idf qatar agrees pause resume trip make setback factor blinken hamas alive administration distance air medical obstacle plan refuse refusal access recent ward safe gathering situation work israel sick grant determine sadly add egypt minister offensive comment stress group complicate lead week state dash sexually control decline speak monday envoy include irresponsible director alex specific discourse council tool give broker woman thursday time statement washington additional hit hop house guy especially shot intelligence truth provide carstens agreement assume list hope qatari white anonymity communication security community briefing call,-0.9531499999999999,0.06841505131128849,11.005151515151514,0.4006279728501952,0
Politico,McCarthy’s exit and the ripple effects back home,2023-12-07 09:32:00,Lara Korte,"Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy‘s announcement that he would resign from Congress at the end of the year throws his own political future — and the fates of vulnerable California Republicans — into murky territory.His resignation comes as a disappointment, but not a surprise, to his loyal supporters in Congress. McCarthy is well-liked in his Central Valley district, but he would have faced withering campaign attacks over a dysfunctional Congress and his failure to rein in far-right members.It doesn’t exactly make for a great mailer.“He’s the hometown boy who made good, but then he had a tragic end,” Mark Salvaggio, a former Bakersfield City Council member, told POLITICO. “The reaction here locally is sadness, disappointment … but people understand. They respect his decision.”McCarthy aimed to strike an optimistic tone in announcing his departure, promising to stay “in the fight” even though he’ll no longer be in a position to do much fighting. He can still attempt to recruit candidates and raise money for them, but there’s a big difference between having the speaker in your corner and having a former member.“It’s going to be hard for them to replicate the operation that Kevin had,” said Rob Stutzman, a top Republican operative in California who has known McCarthy since his time in the statehouse in Sacramento. “They won’t be able to. Johnson doesn’t have the relationships and fundraising prowess.”McCarthy’s ouster from leadership in October had already threatened to leave Republicans in Biden-won House districts rudderless, especially in fundraising. As speaker, McCarthy elevated the California GOP in both visibility and power.Without him even in the building, incumbents like Reps. David Valadao, Mike Garcia, John Duarte, Ken Calvert and Michelle Steel could be in serious trouble.Mike Madrid, a California Republican consultant who makes no secret of his disdain for the Trump-era version of his own party, put it in simple terms: “Investing in the California Republican party is like investing in Blockbuster. The only reason people would was because they had a relationship with Kevin.”Madrid said the bigger impact could be on the state party infrastructure. He said he expects Republicans will be able to fully fund candidates in battleground races without McCarthy. (Worth noting: GOP candidates currently have more cash on hand than Democrats in seven of the state’s 10 most-watched House districts.)Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to call a special election for the remainder of McCarthy’s term. It would be held simultaneously as the March primary and November general election, meaning the candidates would likely appear multiple times on the ballot.Potential replacements include state Sen. Shannon Grove and Assemblymember Vince Fong. Neither Grove nor Fong returned messages on Wednesday asking about a bid for the seat, but both released public statements praising McCarthy for his years of leadership.Grove, one of the more right-leaning Republicans in the California statehouse, received huge recognition this year for forcing passage of a human-trafficking bill that some Democrats had initially tried to block. Fong, who used to work as McCarthy’s district director, maintains close ties to the former speaker, and even called him “one of my best friends” in an Instagram post on Wednesday.Jeremy B.

Politico,Legal weed takes effect in Ohio as lawmakers scramble to change voter-passed law,2023-12-07 12:55:00,Mona Zhang,"Ohio is officially the 24th state to have legal, adult-use marijuana.Provisions of a voter-approved legalization law took effect at midnight, including legal possession and home cultivation for anyone at least 21 years old.But Ohio lawmakers are rushing to pass legislation to make changes to the initiative. On Wednesday, the Senate passed legislation to alter potency caps, taxation, home cultivation, and social equity and expungement provisions.The Senate proposal would also speed up legal sales by allowing medical marijuana dispensaries to start serving recreational customers immediately.The details: Adults can now possess up to 2.5 ounces of weed and grow up to six plants.Under the voter-passed law, cannabis is subject to a 10 percent excise tax and revenues are directed towards an equity and jobs program.The legalization law also sets up a new cannabis regulatory agency, which will have nine months to go through a rule-making process to launch adult-use sales.What the Senate wants: The Senate proposal would halve the number of plants allowed for home grow, increase the excise tax to 15 percent and allow medical marijuana dispensaries to start serving the adult-use market immediately.It would require expungements upon request and scrap the social equity and jobs program. Instead, the tax revenues would go towards law enforcement training, substance abuse treatment and the state’s general fund.“What the Senate passed yesterday still does not respect the will of the voters,” said Tom Haren, a spokesperson for the legalization campaign.Haren says that potency restrictions and higher tax rates under the Senate bill will make it difficult to compete with the illicit market and will still drive Ohioans to buy marijuana in Michigan.What’s next: The House Finance committee is taking up its own marijuana bill today.

Politico,"House Education committee to launch probe into Harvard, MIT and Penn over antisemitism",2023-12-07 14:06:00,Bianca Quilantan,"The House Education and the Workforce Committee announced it will be investigating Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania after their institutions’ leaders failed to sufficiently condemn student protests calling for “Jewish genocide.”“After this week’s pathetic and morally bankrupt testimony by university presidents when answering my questions, the Education and Workforce Committee is launching an official Congressional investigation with the full force of subpoena power into Penn, MIT, & Harvard and others,” Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the fourth-ranking House Republican, said in a statement.“We will use our full Congressional authority to hold these schools accountable for their failure on the global stage,” she said.Stefanik, along with other Republicans on the House education committee, needled Harvard President Claudine Gay, Penn President Liz Magill and MIT President Sally Kornbluth at a more than five-hour hearing Tuesday over their response to antisemitism on their campuses since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Stefanik demanded the college leaders outline whether pro-Palestinian student protesters’ calls for “intifada” or “the genocide of Jews” violate their codes of conduct on bullying or harassment.The college presidents, some of whom have since apologized for their testimony, refused to say “calling for Jewish genocide” is classified as bullying, harassment or violates their school policy. They also said while they personally did not agree with the rhetoric used by those students, they are committed to preserving free speech on campus.House Education and Workforce Chair Virginia Foxx on Thursday called the presidents’ testimonies “unacceptable” and said committee members have “deep concerns with their leadership” and “failure” to keep their campuses safe for Jewish students. The committee’s formal investigation will probe the schools’ learning environments, policies and disciplinary procedures.“This investigation will include substantial document requests, and the Committee will not hesitate to utilize compulsory measures including subpoenas if a full response is not immediately forthcoming,” Foxx said in a statement, adding that the investigations will not be limited to just Harvard, MIT and Penn.“Other universities should expect investigations as well, as their litany of similar failures has not gone unnoticed,” Foxx said.Harvard and MIT, in response to the announcement, said they will work with the committee and share information as lawmakers pursue their inquiry.Harvard said its work to combat antisemitism “is advancing with the highest commitment and attention from University leaders.” And MIT responded that it “rejects antisemitism in all its forms” and “has stood up a campus-wide initiative ‘Standing Against Hate.’”",2843,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/colleges-anitsemitism-house-education-committee-00130666,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/6e9f5b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6065x4043+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fda%2Fb5%2Fa81834944ad0abaab2b9a1f3c764%2Fcongress-education-colleges-antisemitism-02594.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,bullying harvard unnoticed leadership respond disciplinary response speech share investigation sufficiently jewish litany genocide code unacceptable attack request force massachusetts fail launch hamas policy college violate formal pursue free expect stefanik concern power similar stood refuse hate substantial morally compulsory claudine full subpoena campus safe commit personally announcement work israel utilize bankrupt education president institution tuesday chair lawmaker question add probe environment violates pathetic failure demand congressional learn week outline school combat global elise intifada kornbluth high penn magill york information include protester gay virginia document technology antisemitism attention stage advance measure accountable initiative stand protest answer student conduct university harassment announce needle hold thursday republican commitment statement form agree foxx house limited pennsylvania authority deep testimony sally workforce immediately liz jew forthcoming hearing hesitate rhetoric member condemn classify institute apologize call reject preserve investigate official leader committee,-0.9857,0.0,14.080084033613439,0.4052294372294372,0
Politico,"Top lawmakers drop abortion limits from defense bill, setting up fight with the right",2023-12-07 08:20:00,Connor O’Brien,"A compromise defense policy bill unveiled late Wednesday will not include a Republican-backed proposal to block the Pentagon’s abortion travel policy, nixing a controversial measure that threatened to tank the legislation.The exclusion — coupled with an extension of controversial federal surveillance powers — sets up a test for Speaker Mike Johnson, who will need to sell a deal that is more moderate than the hard-right defense bill the House passed in July largely along party lines.Johnson’s task of uniting Republicans behind the $886 billion National Defense Authorization Act will be further complicated by congressional leaders’ decision to attach a four-month extension of warrantless government surveillance authorities.The Senate moved first and is expected to vote on the bill early next week after clearing an initial procedural hurdle Thursday. The House will follow and is likely to consider the measure under suspension of the rules — an expedited process that requires a two-thirds majority. The tactic could ease Johnson’s push to pass the deal by bypassing tricky procedural votes that hardliners have tanked recently.This new version of the bill is on track to pass both houses with bipartisan support. Yet the abortion policy omission is a blow to conservatives who muscled the provision into the House version of the bill over the summer.Hard-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a member of the conference committee on the defense bill, described her position as “hell no” after GOP provisions on abortion and transgender troops fell away and an extension of the surveillance authorities was included.“This was a total sell-out of conservative principles and a huge win for Democrats,” Greene tweeted.Still, Republicans saw wins with some concessions that rein in Pentagon efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the ranks.Lawmakers in both parties expect Johnson to help shepherd a bipartisan bill through the House. But pushing through a bill that drops many conservative priorities could earn Johnson even greater ire. He’s already taking heat from his right flank on government funding, Ukraine aid and other issues.The Pentagon instituted a policy this year to reimburse troops for the costs of traveling to seek abortions. Republicans argue it undermines laws that bar taxpayer money for abortions.The Democratic-led Senate sidestepped the abortion issue altogether in the debate on its version of the defense bill. Blocking the Pentagon’s abortion travel policy was a red line for Democrats that would have tanked the bill.House Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) predicted the lack of abortion language won’t be a major impediment to the bill’s chances because most Republicans saw it as a long shot.“I told everybody when that stuff was added on the floor, it was never going to survive the Senate,” Rogers said. “And anybody who thought it was [is] not being realistic.”The final deal also drops controversial House GOP-backed language blocking coverage of transition surgeries and hormone treatments for transgender troops.But attaching a short-term extension of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act until April 19 may be Johnson’s biggest stumbling block within his own ranks.Conservatives, including House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), had privately urged him to keep the two issues separate, as did Rogers.Congress has until the end of the year to reauthorize the surveillance authority, which is meant to target foreigners abroad but also has the ability to sweep in Americans. But with no agreed-upon path forward, lawmakers need more time.Johnson defended linking the NDAA and the surveillance extension in a letter Thursday to fellow Republicans, saying he received a commitment from Senate leaders that they would negotiate a final surveillance bill. In a joint statement Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell committed to “work in good faith” on a bipartisan bill that can pass both chambers.Republican leaders plan to do a whip count electronically on Friday, which will give them an idea of how many members may defect on the defense bill.Rogers said he’s urging lawmakers to base their votes on the totality of the 3,000-plus page bill, not just a four-month surveillance extension.“To say, ‘Well, I can’t vote for it with FISA.’ No, you’re going to be on record voting against everything that’s in the largest bill that passes each year,” Rogers said. “There’s many, many, many items in there that you probably don’t want to be on the record as opposing.”Still, conservatives won some concessions in the final Pentagon policy bill that Republican leaders hope will sell the package to their ranks.The bill kept House language banning the endorsement of critical race theory in the military.The deal also requires the Pentagon comptroller to review the workforce dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion programs and policy. It also includes a salary cap and hiring freeze for the diversity workforce.The bill text also includes a requirement that the Pentagon develop a plan on what to do with unused border wall materials. The language follows a push from Senate Armed Services ranking member Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) to halt the Biden administration’s auctioning of those materials.Jordain Carney contributed to this report.",5372,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/ndaa-abortion-limits-00130574,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/77e7693/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3604x2337+0+0/resize/630x409!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fee%2Fc3%2Fd788a0794f5bb9b09269d23d6e85%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1253571163,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,funding minority taxpayer treatment totality hormone record tanked win huge line unite urge mcconnell requirement critical track develop version american major troop long promote concession ban rank service ndaa large described carney contribute muscle power whip auction argue rule mike rogers effort defect exclusion diversity receive law deal review impediment meant told hardliner sidestep cost congressional senate push april travel bill reimburse wednesday total attach wicker defend electronically freeze pentagon biden dedicate cap consider move equity package bypassing probably late heat drop omission earn procedural roger floor measure coverage set red fell republican idea commitment privately bar page ire test wall border speaker require national surgery link friday workforce unused rein year expedite lack voting provision controversial away follow member act foreigner report warrantless leader mitch flank sweep tactic hurdle abortion tricky salary program defense majority threaten comptroller chance altogether negotiate moderate party section aid unveiled forward july policy sell joint foreign administration expect largely early predict hire plan text commit work principle support path fellow chair lawmaker add gop reauthorize johnson debate complicate base marjorie week conference proposal surveillance priority seek ability task decision clearing stumble big position judiciary abroad vote process federal include material endorsement taylor jordan survive transition shepherd tank give government money couple transgender thursday bipartisan race suspension statement issue item inclusion house initial final authority extension conservative target intelligence hell letter count stuff halt greene faith chuck block ease theory arm undermines compromise language hope ukraine separate billion institute great schumer pass blow nix authorization democrat committee,0.91225,0.22338049143708116,12.252435897435895,0.5695567689885873,0
Politico,And the grand total of times candidates attacked Trump on the debate stage is…,2023-12-07 15:38:00,Jessica Piper,"Donald Trump has gotten kid glove treatment from his Republican opponents throughout a crucial stretch of the primary season — and the numbers prove it.A POLITICO analysis of the four GOP debates reveals a surprising pattern: With each debate, the candidates have been more and more inclined to go after each other instead of Trump, the far-and-away leader in the polls. The trend continued on Wednesday night, when only Chris Christie, the lowest-polling contender to make the debate stage, mounted sustained attacks on the former president.The analysis, based on transcripts from Rev.com, an audio transcription service, identified how often Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Christie attacked Trump, President Joe Biden and each other across the four debates. All direct criticisms, in which candidates called out each other by name, were included. So were more veiled attacks when the target was clear, like the moment in the third debate when Ramaswamy compared Haley to “Dick Cheney in three inch heels,” adding “in which case, we’ve got two of them on stage tonight” — a jab at DeSantis amid speculation that the Florida governor wears shoe lifts.The volume of attacks directed at other GOP rivals underscores how the debates have largely been a fight for second place. And coupled with polling indicating Trump’s lead has only grown since the debates started in August, it may validate the former president’s decision to skip the debates altogether.The candidates have spent little of their time in front of a national audience trying to take down their biggest competitor: Trump, who holds at least a 30-point lead in nearly every poll.In Wednesday’s debate, the four candidates swiped at each other 28 times while targeting Trump on just nine occasions.Moreover, attacks on the former president haven’t increased as the debates have gone on, despite his continued rise in the polls. In the first debate, when Trump had 52 percent in the national polls, the candidates leveled 10 attacks against the former president. He now sits at 60 percent, but faces fewer attacks.Part of the trend may be driven by who makes the stage: Most of the Trump critics in the race just haven’t done very well, either dropping out or not qualifying for later debates.Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, for example, attacked Trump twice in the first debate before failing to qualify for subsequent contests. Former Vice President Mike Pence attacked his former boss in each of the first two debates but dropped out of the race before the third.That left only Christie as the only major Trump critic Wednesday on the debate stage, where he lambasted his fellow candidates for acting like the former president was not running and compared Trump to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter franchise who people refuse to name.“We’ve had these three acting as if the race is between the four of us,” Christie said. “The fifth guy who doesn’t have the guts to show up and stand here, he’s the one who, as [moderators] just put it, is way ahead in the polls.”The Trump critics’ struggles — and Trump’s continued rise in the polls — reflects how opposition to the former president may not play well with Republican primary voters and helps explain why other candidates may be reluctant to go after him, even as he remains their biggest obstacle to the nomination.Perhaps sensing they are running out of time to overtake Trump, the attacks on the former president ticked up slightly in the fourth debate. Christie went after the former president four times Wednesday, Haley three times, and DeSantis twice.Asked directly about Trump’s age midway through the debate, DeSantis said “we need somebody that’s younger,” questioned Trump’s electability, and bashed him for not getting Mexico to pay for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and not firing health adviser Anthony Fauci. That kept with a theme of the Florida governor’s campaign of attacking Trump from the right on issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the border.But Haley and DeSantis dodged some of moderators’ — and Christie’s — efforts to press them into laying into Trump more aggressively. Asked about Trump’s advocacy for a ban on Muslim immigrants, Haley said there should not be a “straight-up Muslim ban” but added that “certain countries are dangerous and are threats to us.” DeSantis declined to characterize Trump as “mentally unfit” when pressed on that phrase by Christie and the moderators.Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has been a regular defender of Trump across all four debates and has never gone after him. On Wednesday, he accused the other three candidates of “licking Donald Trump’s boots for years” only to engage in “Monday morning quarterbacking” now.Clashes between the candidates were a key feature of the fourth debate. And there were clear lines of fire.Haley, who has risen steadily in the polls since the first debate, has become a top target for both Ramaswamy and DeSantis in recent debates. Across all four debates, Ramaswamy has gone after Haley 15 times — more than any other candidate has attacked another, according to POLITICO’s analysis.DeSantis, who had largely ignored Haley in early debates, went on the offense against her seven times in the fourth debate. The attacks began with his first response of the night, when he was asked about his own flagging poll numbers — pivoting to accuse the former U.N. ambassador of caving “any time the left comes after her.”“Love the attention, fellas,” Haley said after being targeted multiple times in the first 15 minutes of the debate.For her part, Haley went after both DeSantis and Ramaswamy on a few occasions — but largely in response to their criticisms. At one point, she declined to respond when Ramaswamy accused her of corruption and identity politics, saying, “It is not worth my time to respond to him.”Christie, who has largely avoided singling out Haley for criticism across all four debates, also stepped up to her defense early in Wednesday’s debate after a slew of Ramaswamy attacks against her.“Nikki and I disagree on some issues … What we don’t disagree on is this is a smart, accomplished woman. You should stop insulting her,” he said.Christie himself was the least-attacked candidate on Wednesday. His opponents might just not see him as a threat: Christie is polling at 2.7 percent nationally, according to FiveThirtyEight.Criticism of Biden has been a frequent feature of the GOP debates, but it’s decreased every debate.Candidates went after Biden nearly twice as many times as they did Trump in the first debate. But on Wednesday, the four GOP candidates attacked the president nine times — exactly as often as they went after Trump.Polls show the incumbent president is unpopular, and Republican candidates may see going after Biden as a good and safe way to gain approval from the party’s base and independent voters who dislike him.But criticizing the president’s handling the economy or accusing him of failing to secure the U.S.-Mexico border also does little to distinguish the GOP candidates from each other or Trump.While the debates are meant to help narrow the Republican primary field, the participants are largely competing with each other for second place.",7285,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/trump-is-facing-fewer-attacks-as-the-debate-season-goes-on-00130682,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/9148665/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3808x2538+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc2%2F73%2F1e7fc96847579fa6436e82216630%2Ftrump-fraud-lawsuit-66687.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country boot respond increase response treatment cave top fella minute narrow line immigrant threat fire participant remains arkansas mexico ahead stop glove opponent major continued inch ban independent moderator service crucial bash audience corruption qualify moment compare mike primary effort pattern vivek lay handle underscore muslim phrase politics front struggle start put adviser amid meant key level critic multiple frequent ticked polling gov poll insult dick transcript occasion wednesday theme avoid trend risen explain biden begin fauci accord august pivot grown drop defender ron stage decrease characterize stand lick reveals heel sits republican carolina unpopular play young politico candidate mount wall incumbent border national fight inclined former accuse press opposition transcription skip field year spent direct step veil cheney single act driven clear advocacy potter shoe leader lambast vice audio despite reflect speculation subsequent validate midway offense case hutchinson dangerous defense morning unfit number florida attack party quarterback make voter competitor surprising fail swipe analysis slew accomplish overtake haley flag gut largely early steadily feature instead obstacle refuse criticism recent reluctant safe entrepreneur penny secure contender fellow campaign chris directly president wear economy question christie compete add gop mentally part governor criticize debate dodge pandemic base season love rival nikki lead fourth contest trump ignore smart place worth identify decision decline sustain big bos regular aggressively monday pay include percent run engage electability point attention couple night left prove villain woman indicate distinguish health approval dislike disagree time hold race joe issue volume guy slightly identity desantis target show donald harry voldemort tonight age ramaswamy south nationally anthony stretch franchise ambassador rise kid call,-0.9894000000000001,0.12354152367879202,9.94207906295754,0.36402182967603536,0
Politico,"UNLV shooting suspect had list of targets at that campus and another university, police say",2023-12-07 18:20:00,Associated Press,"LAS VEGAS — The suspect in the deadly shooting at the University of Las Vegas, Nevada, had a list of targets at the school and at East Carolina University in North Carolina, police said Thursday.Three faculty members were killed and a fourth was wounded by the gunman who opened fire on the campus Wednesday before dying in a shootout with police, according to university officials.Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill identified the suspect as Anthony Polito, a longtime business professor, at a news conference Thursday. Before the shooting, the gunman mailed 22 letters to university faculty members across the U.S., but the contents of those letters wasn’t immediately known, McMahill said.The sheriff said police have contacted everyone on the suspect’s list, except for one person who was on a flight.“None of the individuals on the target list became a victim,” McMahill said.The sheriff said investigators were still looking into a motive but noted that Polito applied for “several” jobs at various colleges and universities in Nevada and was denied the job each time.The suspect’s weapon, a 9mm handgun, was purchased legally last year, McMahill said. Police were still investigating how many rounds were fired during the rampage.President Keith E. Whitfield said in a letter to students and staff that the shooting in the building housing UNLV’s business school “was the most difficult day in the history of our university.” He identified two of the victims who were killed as business school professors Patricia Navarro-Velez and Cha Jan “Jerry” Chang. Whitfield said the name of the third victim will be released after relatives have been notified of the death.The wounded man, a 38-year-old visiting professor, was downgraded to life-threatening condition Thursday, police said at a news conference.Terrified students and professors cowered in classrooms and dorms as the gunman roamed UNLV’s Lee Business School on Wednesday and opened fire just before noon on the fourth floor, where faculty and staff offices for the accounting and marketing departments are located.Navarro-Velez, 39, was an accounting professor who held a Ph.D. in accounting and was currently focused on research in cybersecurity disclosures and data analytics, according to the school’s website.Chang, 64, was an associate professor in the business school’s Management, Entrepreneurship & Technology Department and had been teaching at UNLV since 2001. He held degrees from Taiwan, Central Michigan University and Texas A&M University, according to his online resume. He earned a Ph.D. in management information systems from the University of Pittsburgh.One of Polito’s former students at East Carolina University, Paul Whittington, said Polito went on tangents during class about his many trips to Las Vegas. Polito told his students he visited twice yearly, staying in different hotels and going to various clubs, Whittington said.“He was really, really, really fixated on the city of Las Vegas,” Whittington said. “I think he just really liked going there.”Polito also seemed obsessive over anonymous student reviews at the end of each semester, Whittington said. Polito told Whittington’s class that he remembered the faces of students who gave him bad reviews and would express that he was sure who they were and where they sat, pointing at seats in the classroom, Whittington said.“He always talked about the negative feedback he got,” said Whittington, now 33, who took Polito’s intro to operations management class in 2014. “He didn’t get a lot of it, but there would always be one student every semester, or at least one student every class, that would give a negative review. And he fixated on those.”The attack at UNLV terrified a city that experienced the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history in October 2017, when a gunman killed 60 people and wounded more than 400 after opening fire from the window of a high-rise suite at Mandalay Bay on the Las Vegas Strip, just miles from the UNLV campus.Lessons learned from that shooting helped authorities to work “seamlessly” in reacting to the UNLV attack, McMahill said at a news conference.After opening fire, the gunman went to several other floors of the business school before he was killed in a shootout with two university police detectives outside the building, which is next to the university’s student union, UNLV Police Chief Adam Garcia said.Authorities gave the all-clear about 40 minutes after the first report of an active shooter.It wasn’t immediately clear how many of the school’s 30,000 students were on campus at the time, but McMahill said students had been gathered outside the building and the student union to eat and play games. If police hadn’t killed the attacker, “it could have been countless additional lives taken,” he said.Classes were canceled through Friday at the university, and UNLV’s basketball game at the University of Dayton, Ohio, was canceled Wednesday night because of the shootings. Wrangler National Finals Rodeo also canceled the events that were scheduled Thursday night at the Thomas & Mack Center at UNLV.",5102,https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/unlv-shooting-suspect-list-of-targets-00130741,https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/b5d1e2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7565x5043+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F0a%2F8d%2F08ede18c4635837345155ece4c8b%2Fcampus-shooting-las-vegas-99996.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GNggW5ET63WsrjcQpARO4QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police semester cha lot basketball wound condition minute relative patricia mack seat teach fire weapon feedback handgun tangent michigan whittington campus content unlv classroom react jan system open difficult vega detective taiwan review day express kevin told cancel negative release learn game suspect mail school wednesday experienced faculty department accounting deny fixate contact accord information texas event paul technology eat history earn mcmahill october yearly floor suite shooting modern jerry student operation adam university north bay talk carolina polito play round thomas center obsessive wrangler national former life friday year immediately shoot sat cybersecurity disclosure member held report clear victim visit central person associate remember resume dayton whitfield kill trip attack lee stay schedule chief purchase city keith deadliest college professor dorm cower opening ohio online degree garcia work county motive job different data chang research building countless intro fourth conference notify strip gunman marketing downgrade union identify legally analytics staff window mandalay note focus attacker anonymous roam rodeo active point noon give night class individual sheriff housing shootout deadly nevada management club thursday time additional office seamlessly final authority news target letter apply entrepreneurship east list investigator mile anthony terrify business gather longtime currently investigate,-0.98905,0.4116032928263426,10.896952789699569,0.30791062801932373,0
Washington Post,Carolyn Hax: Partner ‘sick’ at the thought of hosting girlfriend’s deadbeat dad,2023-12-08 00:15:00,Carolyn Hax,"Dear Carolyn: My girlfriend is an amazing person despite having, in a lot of ways, a traumatic childhood with very little joy in it. Her dad left before she could even remember and rarely came around, and her mom worked a lot, so she spent a lot of time alone. The stories she casually tells me just break my heart. Like how for her 6th birthday, her mom scraped up enough money for a nice dinner and a cake and her dad and his family were supposed to show for it. She and her mom sat there under the balloons and streamers and nobody came.She always forgave him and invited him for stuff, but he no-showed her high school graduation and most Christmases.Now we have a nice house together, and she wants to invite her dad and his girlfriend for Christmas Eve, but I don’t want to. I’ve only met the man three times, so the chance they’ll show is slim, but the thought of having to smile at him over Christmas Eve dinner makes me sick.Do I have to defer to my girlfriend, or can I tell her how I feel?— AnonymousAnonymous: Second of all, you can both defer and say how you feel.But phrase it thoughtfully because, first of all, you don’t want to add your distress to the weight she already carries of just trying to be loved.If you can manage your feelings as your own problem, enough to be available to her, then yes to communicating both messages. Your feelings and your support are both important.That might sound like this:“Given everything you’ve told me about your dad, it’s hard for me to welcome him. That said, it’s not about me — it’s your family, so it’s about what you want and need. Sign me up for Christmas Eve, tell me what you need from me, and let’s keep talking so we’re here for each other throughout.”This may be Phase 1 in a long reckoning with him, which he may never show up for. Your showing up for her is what counts. Good stuff.Dear Carolyn: I’m part of a group of college friends that has continued for decades. One was always the charming but unreliable player — counted on to no-show events, even if he was bringing major portions of the meal, or to end up sleeping with another friend’s girlfriend. We all just laughed it off as, “Oh, that’s Tim.”He married, had a kid, and, about 12 years later, showed up with a new partner, telling us he’d had an affair for several years, dumped his wife and was marrying “Lisa.” We were told we had to agree Lisa was the best thing that ever happened to him and move her directly into our group. He’d cleaned out a good part of his kid’s college fund to finance the new romance.I couldn’t, so I stopped our friendship. In retrospect, I was ashamed that we had just laughed off the horrible things he’d done to other people in the past.Years have gone by. Lisa didn’t last long, and some in our group rebuilt friendships with Tim — mainly the men — and some have not — mainly the women. Every so often, one of the guys will say I need to restart the friendship for old times’ sake. I don’t see the need. Am I closed-minded?— AnonymousAnonymous: He stole from his child.

Washington Post,Miss Manners: Should everyone take a turn buying a round of drinks?,2023-12-08 00:00:00,Judith Martin,"Dear Miss Manners: I contend that buying a round of drinks when out with friends is like giving a gift, in that one should do so without anticipation of the gesture being reciprocated. It is a way of saying, “I am grateful for your company, and here is my effort to enliven our night out.”“Bosh,” says my friend: Buying a round of drinks is an established custom, in that over the course of the evening, each person is expected to take his or her turn. Please let me know whether to be smug or admonished.Buying a round of drinks should not come with an expectation, but it is always kind to reciprocate. So “Bosh,” Miss Manners supposes, to both of you. (And “Cheers!”)Dear Miss Manners: We’ve had a cleaning lady for about a year. I’m generally happy with her work, but it sort of drives me crazy when she’s overly chatty while working. She even goes as far as complimenting my belongings and saying how much she wishes she could afford the same.Sometimes, if there is excess stuff I no longer want (such as extra clothing, shoes, bath products or decor), I’ll offer them to her, but she generally just hints that I should simply give her my belongings. She’s never stolen anything, to my knowledge, but I’m sort of getting uncomfortable with her doing this. I find it a bit unprofessional.How do I put an end to this without seeming selfish? She’s already getting paid to do a job!“I am so glad that you enjoy the house and seem to appreciate my taste. I will certainly tell you next time I am able to give some things away.”As for the excessive chatting, Miss Manners suggests you pick a room that is not being cleaned and get very busy with your own work.Dear Miss Manners: I have a number of questions about punches — serving them, rather than throwing them. I have a lovely antique punch bowl I would like to use correctly.Is it proper to serve punch at both afternoon and evening gatherings? May I prepare a nonalcoholic punch, but provide champagne and/or spirits for the guests to add if they wish? Should there be a card or some kind of menu instructing guests on what flavor it is, or what ingredients it contains? Finally, am I obligated to use the teensy-weensy punch cups, or may the punch be ladled into more elegant and generous stemware, such as coupe glasses?Punch may be served at almost any time of day. Maybe not breakfast.Making it nonalcoholic, with liquor to be added separately, is a nice idea as long as your guests are trustworthy. Clearly labeling everything — with the main ingredients, not necessarily the whole recipe — may also be appreciated. As for glassware, it should be judged by its relative likelihood of capturing the contents of the ladle.

Washington Post,"Ask Amy: My daughter-in-law is so cold to me, and it hurts my son",2023-12-08 00:00:00,Amy Dickinson,"Dear Amy: I am troubled. I have been giving — really extending — the benefit of the doubt to “Jan,” my daughter-in-law, for some time. I see my son and Jan a couple of times a year, when I visit their city. I get a hotel room willingly and without question. I am friendly and supportive, I compliment her sincerely, and I find positive, noncontroversial things to talk about.She just doesn’t seem to like me — or my visits — and it clearly hurts and upsets my son. She is openly impatient with him and absolutely cold to me. I can do nothing right. It would be nice if we could be friends, but if that’s too much, I would be okay with being simply polite.I am bewildered and hurt for my son. I know that he is courteous and welcoming to her parents. I don’t know what I have done, if anything. Should I ask if I’ve offended her somehow?I don’t want to cause a kerfuffle for my son, but I think that maybe I trigger difficulty between them for reasons I’m unsure of. This is not improving with time. (It’s been four years now.) I can no longer pretend that I don’t notice, and I am wondering what you think I should do.— Somebody’s MomMom: You have done your best to basically put your head down and endure this, politely — hoping, no doubt, that “Jan’s” attitude toward you would change as time went on and she discovered that you are a benign, low-impact presence in her family’s life.You don’t seem to have asked your son what challenges he and his wife are facing. She could struggle with extreme anxiety, depression or another mental or physical health challenge that neither of them has chosen to disclose to you.So I would start with your son. Ask him, “Are there things I could or should do to make things easier for you and Jan when I visit?”Based on how your son answers, you could open up and share your own questions, concerns and challenges. Based on the vibe during your next visit, I suggest speaking with Jan privately, asking her a version of the questions you’ve asked your son. Tell her that you don’t want to burden either of them, but that you are worried that she seems stressed when she sees you.In short, nudge the door open and give her space to walk through.Dear Amy: I’ve lived in my home for five years. There is a very large tree in the backyard. At this time of year, the leaves obviously fall to the ground in both my yard and my neighbor’s yard. My neighbors have asked me to give them money to clean the leaves from their yard. We are both homeowners, and in my opinion, homeowners sign up for the responsibility of maintaining our home and yard when we buy the home.My neighbors on the other side of my house have leaves that fall into my yard, and I would never assume it is their responsibility to clean the leaves that fall onto my property. I am at a loss because this is not the first time my neighbors have asked about this. In previous years, I have said “no,” and yet they keep asking. I don’t want to start a precedent of giving them money every year, but I don’t want to be argumentative.Any suggestions?— Leave the Leaves?Leave: Please remember that anyone can ask anything. Asking can be very easy. “No” can require a flash of courage and sometimes a bit of finesse.You are not responsible for the leaves that have fallen in your neighbor’s yard. (Double check your local laws and statutes.) And now, after five years of saying “no,” in my opinion, you no longer need to respond at all. There is no need to respond again. Let your “no” precedent remain, like that last stubborn oak leaf clinging to its branch.Dear Amy: Your response to “First-time Grandparents” was inadequate, to say the least. Their daughter-in-law’s parents had behaved abusively toward them, by berating them publicly.Their son and daughter-in-law need to confront her parents about their inappropriate behavior and strongly suggest an apology to the injured parties. To do less is just asking for the wound to fester.— UpsetUpset: You make a good point, but because these other in-laws were so volatile and explosive, I worried that confronting them might make matters worse.",4093,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/12/08/ask-amy-daughter-in-law-cold/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,chosen reason behavior respond oak fall grandparent response homeowner wound change share short opinion confront courteous friendly doubt courage side version improve suggest politely large stubborn compliment precedent leaf leave statute troubled neighbor jan open struggle maintain start matter put law unsure responsible sincerely property remain hurt wonder room worried positive buy presence head clean local impatient benefit live basically apology extend nudge cold mental answer injured home sign dear talk bit privately simply bewilder trigger abusively require mommom absolutely year loss kerfuffle inadequate willingly tree benign yard visit endure responsibility upsetupset difficulty double remember strongly party make wife noncontroversial city berating nice concern cling upset family suggestion attitude disclose friend previous question stress easy walk extreme find pretend volatile base ground check challenge amy parent anxiety speak supportive backyard depression welcome space flash point give couple money longer explosive health notice behave time hop house burden assume discover physical vibe inappropriate offend openly,0.008599999999999997,0.2931834839970682,5.441766704416761,0.504493346160013,0
Washington Post,"LeBron James’s Lakers, Tyrese Haliburton’s Pacers to meet in tournament final",2023-12-07 21:22:00,Ben Golliver,"LAS VEGAS — Tyrese Haliburton’s circuitous journey to basketball stardom took him from Oshkosh, Wis., to Ames, Iowa, and then, once in the NBA, from Sacramento to Indianapolis via trade. So it was only right that the Indiana Pacers guard covered an incredible amount of ground to hit the biggest shot of his career.The upstart Pacers scored a 128-119 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in the first in-season tournament semifinal at T-Mobile Arena on Thursday, eliminating Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard and Company from the NBA’s inaugural December showcase. Haliburton, who has led Indiana to a 6-0 record in the tournament, drilled a step-back three-pointer with 48 seconds left to put away the 2021 NBA champions and spoil a potential showdown between Antetokounmpo and LeBron James, whose Los Angeles Lakers scored a 133-89 blowout over the New Orleans Pelicans in the second semifinal.Saturday’s championship game will pit the small-market Pacers against the mega-market Lakers, who are 6-0 in the tournament, in a rematch of the 2000 NBA Finals. The tournament champions will hoist the NBA Cup, and each player on the winning team will earn a $500,000 bonus.“We’re a disrupter,” said Pacers Coach Rick Carlisle, whose team eliminated the Bucks and Boston Celtics, the Eastern Conference’s top two seeds, from the tournament. “A lot of people didn’t want us here. We earned our way here. It’s why we came here. It’s all about getting to the finish line. We talked this morning to our guys about the process that works for us. The process is a team process. It’s a collective effort and a collective will.”The 23-year-old Haliburton has led the NBA’s fastest and most efficient offense through the first quarter of the season, and he opened the decisive possession of the first semifinal by missing a three-pointer from the top of the key. After a scramble for the rebound, Haliburton came up with the ball in the paint, circled back to the top of the arc and then angled left so that he could attack Bucks center Brook Lopez in isolation.With Lopez back on his heels to protect against a drive, Haliburton skipped backward and to his left, lining up his feet behind the arc before draining the three-pointer in front of an excited Pacers bench. The fourth-year guard then looked down at his right wrist, an apparent reference to Lillard’s “Dame Time” celebration for clutch shots.“I learned as a kid, when you dish it out, you’ve got to be willing to take it,” Lillard said of Haliburton’s celebration. “For as many times as I’ve done it to people, I can’t be upset when somebody else does it. I think that’s also a sign of respect and acknowledgment for knowing my history and knowing what I do.”Haliburton finished with 27 points, 15 assists and no turnovers for the Pacers, who haven’t reached the playoffs since 2020 or won a postseason series since 2014.“It was just in the heat of the moment,” Haliburton said. “Having fun. I kind of pounded my chest and said it was my time. It’s our time as a group. We’re playing the right way. We’re shocking the world right now and we’re going to continue to do that. It doesn’t matter who believes in us.”Indiana withstood a game-high 37 points from Antetokounmpo and displayed impressive resolve in a back-and-forth final period. Haliburton, who is averaging 26.9 points and a league-leading 12.1 assists, did a little bit of everything down the stretch, finding Obi Toppin on a picture-perfect alley-oop and blowing past Lopez to finish an acrobatic layup in transition.“I thought he was spectacular: 27 [points] and 15 [assists] these days are kind of like average numbers for [Haliburton],” Carlisle said. “He drove the bus when the game counted down the stretch. He’s a great closer. Tyrese is just one of those transcendent players. He has all the tools and all the personality and has the desire. People are talking about him for MVP and rightfully so.”The NBA’s inaugural tournament enjoyed a raucous quarterfinals held in the home arenas of the top four qualifiers from the opening round group stage, but the shift to a neutral site for the semifinals brought some complications.Las Vegas was in a somber mood following a Wednesday shooting that left three dead at UNLV, and Thursday’s festivities began with a moment of silence for the victims. The made-for-television doubleheader, which featured combined broadcast crews from ESPN and TNT, tipped off at 2 p.m. local time in front of thousands of empty seats. Because of the tournament’s knockout format for the quarterfinals, which were held Monday and Tuesday, fans of the qualifying teams had only a few days’ notice to book trips to Sin City, while local fans had to clear their schedules on a weekday afternoon.The result was a subdued atmosphere for the matinee between the Bucks and Pacers, though a blue-and-red painted court, stage lighting on the court and the presence of Hall of Famers Shaquille O’Neal, Julius Erving, Gary Payton and Mitch Richmond added some juice.Thursday’s nightcap was a more boisterous affair, at least while it was still competitive.James and the Lakers handled the Pelicans with ease, boosted by a crowd that was heavily tilted in their favor given Las Vegas’s proximity to Southern California. The four-time MVP cranked up his intensity from the outset, scoring 18 points and taking two charges on the defensive end in the second quarter alone. Los Angeles took a 67-54 lead into halftime and never looked back.After reiterating his desire to one day own an NBA franchise in Las Vegas, James treated Sin City to one of his most commanding performances since the Lakers’ 2020 title run in the Bubble. Los Angeles outscored New Orleans by 36 points in James’s 23 minutes, and he finished with a game-high 30 points to go along with five rebounds and eight assists. Anthony Davis added 16 points, 15 rebounds and five assists, and six Lakers scored in double figures.“Just trying to lead by example,” James said. “Make plays on the floor. Be unselfish. We’ve been successful with the [2020 Bubble and the play-in tournament]. This [in-season tournament] has been good so far to us as well. We’ve got to finish our breakfast on Saturday.”Trey Murphy III notched a team-high 14 points for the Pelicans. Zion Williamson added 13 points, and Brandon Ingram managed just nine points on 4-13 shooting.With the result in hand early, Lakers Coach Darvin Ham was able to rest James for the final 17-plus minutes of the 44-point win — the franchise’s largest margin of victory since Jan. 11, 2011.",6540,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/07/nba-tournament-semifinals-pacers-bucks-lakers-pelicans/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,player subdue ball lot basketball assist quarter richmond record top ames breakfast halftime respect trey back minute manage brook win circle continue line resolve seat cover neutral rebound amount kind showcase book clutch charge drive enjoy cranked matinee tournament impressive oshkosh large murphy carlisle hall guard sacramento qualify moment hoist semifinal unlv personality effort celtic handle company open front matter vega boisterous layup put unselfish day zion mood rightfully atmosphere key fun learn game spectacular reach arc wednesday turnover journey orleans presence silence begin notch local tilt rick heavily cup drill foot california potential eastern tipped heat past celebration outscore history earn southern crowd stage floor fast bench julius james spoil possession heel iowa home combine sign displayed stardom finish talk ingram outset bit raucous play site blowout round incredible center reference light period performance affair skip shoot boost dead shock pelican away follow brandon held result weekday clear december disrupter rest mitch team lakers blowing victim drain proximity double offense morning defensive number doubleheader trip iii lillard average attack toppin transcendent make espn schedule tyrese qualifier court hand city victory desire boston showdown obi favor bus early command opening feature payton upset lebron successful postseason broadcast erving eliminate believe inaugural work shaquille knockout dame damian collective indianapolis acknowledgment pound tuesday upstart indiana add playoff festivity empty somber withstood efficient group find reiterate title chest season ground lead crew conference williamson wrist trade championship shift antetokounmpo mvp scramble big lopez monday coach process drove protect rematch excite champion giannis acrobatic pacer arena angle run angeles point tool gary give left pit backward world format apparent notice score time thursday nba miss intensity brought hit guy haliburton final famers shot dish darvin bubble margin nightcap circuitous quarterfinal count thousand closer treat ease neal decisive milwaukee anthony stretch franchise davis seed great kid buck tnt paint series,0.9915499999999999,0.18348623853211007,7.8673312883435536,0.4776926406926405,0
Washington Post,"Jon Rahm joins LIV Golf, a major blow to the PGA Tour",2023-12-07 18:17:00,,"Jon Rahm, the world’s third-ranked player and the reigning Masters champion, will join LIV Golf next season, a move that robs the PGA Tour of one its biggest draws and promises to light a new fire under the rivalry between the competing golf circuits.The news could have major ramifications for the relationship between the PGA Tour and the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which owns LIV Golf. The two parties reached a preliminary agreement to join forces six months ago but have yet to reach final terms. In their initial agreement, LIV Golf promised not to poach PGA Tour talent, but the two sides dropped that provision in July at the urging of the Justice Department, which raised concerns that non-solicitation language would stifle competition.Rahm is the first tour player to join LIV Golf since the two sides dropped their litigation against each other in June and agreed to partner, and his signing could signal that the doors are open for other tour players to follow suit. Terms of Rahm’s deal were not immediately known, though some of LIV’s other marquee players signed contracts that guaranteed nine-figure paydays. Many of the original LIV players came under withering criticism for taking Saudi money, although that argument was diluted by the PGA Tour’s subsequent agreement.“Every decision that we make in life there will be somebody who agrees and likes it and somebody who doesn’t, right?” Rahm told reporters in a conference call Thursday afternoon. “I made this decision because I believe it’s the best for me and my family.” Asked later whether money was the key driver of his decision, Rahm said: “It’s one of the reasons, yeah. I mean, I’m not going to sit here and lie to you. It’s definitely one of the reasons.”Unlike some of the other big names LIV lured away from the tour, many of whom were later in their careers, Rahm is at the peak of his game. The 29-year old Spaniard won the Masters in April, finished second at the British Open in July and helped the European team capture the Ryder Cup in October. He won three other tour events last season, giving him 11 in his career. Rahm will become the 14th major winner to make the LIV leap, joining past major champions such as Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith and Brooks Koepka.Though he pledged his loyalty to the PGA Tour on many occasions, Rahm long had been rumored as a LIV target. He was critical of the tour’s season-ending FedEx Cup championship format and, like many golfers, wasn’t pleased that tour officials negotiated with the Saudi PIF without the input of players.Speaking at the U.S. Open in June, Rahm said “you want to have faith in management” but that “a lot of people feel a bit of betrayal.”“It’s just not easy as a player that’s been involved, like many others, to wake up one day and see this bombshell,” he said then.But he had also made clear that he would remain loyal to the tour and did not like LIV’s format. He’s said the 54-hole, no-cut competition “is not a golf tournament. … It’s that simple.”“I want to play against the best in the world in a format that’s been going on for hundreds of years. That’s what I want to see,” Rahm said in June 2022. “Yeah, money is great, but when [his wife] Kelley and I … we started talking about it, and we’re like, ‘Will our lifestyle change if I got $400 million?’ No, it will not change one bit.“Truth be told, I could retire right now with what I’ve made and live a very happy life and not play golf again,” he continued. “So I’ve never really played the game of golf for monetary reasons. I play for the love of the game, and I want to play against the best in the world. I’ve always been interested in history and legacy, and right now the PGA Tour has that.”“My heart is with the PGA Tour,” he said. “That’s all I can say.”On Thursday, Rahm said he was “forever grateful for the PGA Tour and the platform that they’ve allowed me to be on. I have nothing bad to say about them. … This is just more about me and what I believe is best for my career and my chance to maybe make a mark.” Asked later how his decision will impact the PGA Tour, Rahm said, “I really haven’t thought about it.”Losing Rahm will be viewed by much of the golf world as the single biggest blow the PGA Tour’s roster of talent has suffered to date and threatens to impact the ongoing negotiations with the Saudis. Though the two sides agreed to drop the non-recruitment provision, there was a basic understanding that they would continue negotiating in good faith, according to people familiar with the talks.“Our focus remains on the PGA Tour and unifying the game for our fans and players,” a PGA Tour spokesman said Thursday. “We can’t speak for decisions that any individual players might make, but ... we are in position to make our players equity owners and further allow the Tour to invest in our members, invest in our fans and continue to lead men’s professional golf forward.”Recent efforts by LIV officials to recruit other PGA Tour players has ruffled feathers among tour executives, but they still have been working toward a final agreement.“I’m not sure specifically how it would impact those negotiations, but all in all, Jon Rahm is one of the biggest assets that we have on the PGA Tour,” golfer Jordan Spieth, a member of the tour’s policy board, said last week. “So it would be a really — really not very good for us in general because we want to play against the best players in the world and that’s what Jon is.”PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan had planned to meet this week with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi PIF, to continue negotiations, but that meeting was pushed back. While the PGA Tour has also been in talks with other investors to help form a new entity that would oversee the tour’s commercial efforts, Monahan said last week he remained hopeful the tour would soon agree to final terms with the PIF. The two sides face a Dec. 31 deadline but could push that target back into next year.“We’re having conversations with multiple parties,” Monahan said last week, speaking at the New York Times DealBook Summit. “The deadline for our conversations with PIF, as you know, is a firm target. I’ll be with Yasir next week. And we continue to advance our conversations. And I think it’s pretty well known that there’s a large number of other interested parties that we’re also pushing to think about.”Rahm’s move is sure to cause waves among PGA Tour players, many of whom were upset that their loyalty to the tour hasn’t been properly recognized or rewarded. The tour is still discussing how it might welcome back LIV players and what kind of punishment or levies would be necessary.“That’s part of the deal we’re working through is trying to find a path, whatever that looks like,” Tiger Woods, a member of the tour’s policy board, said last week. “There’s so many different scenarios.”",6884,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/07/jon-rahm-liv-golf/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,european player raise bombshell reason marquee lot change ongoing back poach brook threatens winner leap continue conversation argument public master retire fire urge promise owner saudi remains critical kind relationship side preliminary major long continued tournament lose unify basic firm competition large commercial mickelson draw golf monetary pleased smith professional roster reign view effort loyalty open ruffle start deal peak day told key remain happy multiple loyal executive push game spaniard april reach yasir occasion forever bryson pretty department reporter partner interested move equity payday accord cup live career event platform entity deadline past tour dechambeau definitely drop signing spieth history october board advance meeting commissioner rahm suffer fedex million spokesman sign properly finish talk wake bit form play litigation agree levy oversee driver ago light original life year immediately understand phil provision away follow single specifically member tiger negotiation clear pledge official ryder team guaranteed kelley jon wood unlike grateful meet subsequent june justice lure agrees dustin number chance negotiate party force make robs wife punishment july policy talent concern contract plan criticism upset recent believe work liv discuss path stifle investment month date compete hundred legacy investor summit different part pif johnson governor easy find signal term feather season love lead week conference heart join championship jay wave decision feel big rivalry speak focus golfer position york scenario recruit dealbook champion fund pga welcome rumor general jordan cameron suit impact wither give recognize money played format world individual monahan management involve time thursday familiar asset invest initial final news target truth agreement hopeful dilute faith language ramification reward capture input great lifestyle call british lie blow afternoon,0.9981500000000001,0.043579314352120854,6.215510204081632,0.41597299998676146,0
Washington Post,"Youngkin proposes child care, early education funding as pandemic money ends",2023-12-07 16:31:00,,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) on Thursday proposed spending hundreds of millions of dollars on child care and early education in the state, as federal pandemic relief funds that had been used for such programs begin expiring.The state had used $794 million in federal pandemic relief funds to expand child care and early education programs, but the expiration of those funds means 27,000 children in the state could lose access to their care, according to a news release from Youngkin’s office.Youngkin said his program, called “Building Blocks for Virginia Families,” would allow eligible parents to choose what kind of child care they want to use, such as home-care providers or community co-ops.“This is about families, this is about moms, and Virginians shouldn’t have to worry about getting their children the care they need when they’re at work. but unfortunately so many do,” Youngkin said.The governor said families that already receive child-care support will “continue to have access to early childhood and afterschool programs.”Youngkin also said the program would expand the requirement that parents are employed if they want to receive child care, although he did not offer details.“By expanding the requirements that parents work toward participate in this plan, we are focusing our considerable investment on parents who are working to keep all of those balls in the air as they juggle them and we are ensuring good stewardship of the resources required to make this successful,” he said.Youngkin described the plan as “fiscally sustainable,” and called for more than $440 million to be spent each year over the next two fiscal years — representing an increase of $180 million in state spending over each of those years.Rachael Deane, chief executive at Voices for Virginia’s Children, a statewide advocacy group, said the issue of funding for child care and early education has been “a real crisis,” both in Virginia and nationally. A report from the nonpartisan Virginia Joint Audit and Review Commission found that “child care is incredibly inaccessible to parents in Virginia, and it is unaffordable for more than three-quarters of families across the state,” she said.While pandemic funds were used to expand access to child care and early education in Virginia, Deane said, “as it’s been sunsetting, the question is, what do we do now?”Youngkin said the proposed child care program would include a “digital wallet” that each family can use to “find care and direct care to where it fits their family the best,” and would allow “local governments, employers, philanthropy and others who will contribute towardsthis great need.”A $25 million capital fund to serve 3,000 children in child care deserts, Youngkin said, would be modeled after an effort in Southwest Virginia that brought public and private resources together to remodel an unused building into a child care and workforce development center. The funding would be used for new “early learning hubs” in unused spaces at colleges.The proposal also includes funding to continue a $1 million scholarship program for early education workers, and $10 million a year for incentives for educators.A spokeswoman for Youngkin did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for additional information about the governor’s proposal.“The Building Blocks for Virginia Families plan is about public and private stakeholders coming together,” Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera said in a news release. “We will address childcare deserts, early childhood provider shortages and introduce innovation and partnerships into how we pay for childcare for a sustainable system.”Youngkin’s predecessor, Ralph Northam (D), had expanded child care and early education during his term, a signature issue also for first lady Pamela Northam.David Cary, Pamela Northam’s chief of staff and assistant secretary of early-childhood education at the end of the Northam administration, said many of the initiatives announced Thursday are continuations of previous programs that had bipartisan support when they were passed.“This is all good and we can all agree on this,” Cary said.The governor will need to work with the newly blue General Assembly on this proposal. Youngkin is slated to propose his two-year spending plan on Dec. 20, after which the Democratic-controlled Senate and House of Delegates — which flipped from red to blue in last month’s elections — will take it up.Del. Luke Torian (D-Prince William), incoming House Appropriations Committee chair, said he hadn’t had a chance to see Youngkin’s proposal, but noted that both child care and early education are vital issues in the commonwealth.",4664,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/07/youngkin-child-care-early-education-funding/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,funding ball respond increase continue public request incredibly worry requirement partnership kind lose described contribute commonwealth continuation effort shortage address incoming offer represent childhood receive assistant review deane inaccessible release learn senate executive child gov cary expand resource appropriation digital begin local accord information capital worker hub commission private secretary red luke million agree center delegate require childcare workforce unused year immediately lady unfortunately spent afterschool direct slat stewardship considerable mom report found remodel sustainable advocacy innovation introduce model pamela dollar program scholarship chance nonpartisan provider make glenn desert chief employer spending joint administration relief early crisis air philanthropy aimee access plan fiscal successful family work expiration stakeholder support william education ralph fiscally previous flip chair choose investment month question hundred blue governor group eligible find pandemic building term spokeswoman state employ participate proposal serve r juggle virginian southwest youngkin staff parent note focus unaffordable pay federal include fit wallet fund virginia space general real sunsetting government vital initiative ensure announce thursday guidera bipartisan issue brought additional house northam voice statewide news torian newly audit development propose towardsthis election block signature nationally incentive assembly great community call predecessor committee,0.9782500000000001,0.19296740994854203,11.117602820211516,0.3489669421487604,0
Washington Post,Our Republican debate poll finds Ron DeSantis won but gained little support,2023-12-07 15:00:00,,"In the fourth and final Republican primary debate poll of 2023, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis edged out former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley as the candidate Republican debate watchers thought performed best.Former president Donald Trump once again declined to participate in the debate, but as has been the case throughout the primary, each of these candidates is still running far behind him in the race for the GOP presidential nomination. With less than six weeks before the Iowa caucuses kick off the nominating contest, there is little time for these candidates to close the gap.The 538-Washington Post-Ipsos poll of potential Republican primary and caucus voters who watched Wednesday’s debate, hosted by NewsNation, finds 30 percent thought DeSantis “performed best,” followed by 23 percent who chose Haley. This is a turn in fortunes for Haley, as after the last debate, our poll found that 34 percent of debate watchers thought she performed best, compared with 23 percent who said DeSantis performed best.Debate watchers are more unified, however, in who they think performed the worst in Wednesday’s debate, with 37 percent choosing tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and 31 percent picking former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.Most candidates saw little movement after the debate in the share of GOP debate viewers who consider supporting them. DeSantis, Haley, Ramaswamy and Trump saw the share considering them move one percentage point or less, which is within the poll’s margin of error. Christie is the only candidate who saw a significant jump in support from 21 percent considering him before the debate to 29 percent after, though he still lags far behind Trump, DeSantis and Haley.Looking at GOP voters overall — not just those who tuned in to the debate — the picture is largely the same, with few changing their mind on who they’d support. In national polls measuring voters’ first choice, Trump leads the field by about 40 percentage points.How well liked the candidates are didn’t change much either. Both before and after the debate, DeSantis, Haley and Trump were the most liked. Christie did see a significant jump in his favorability ratings, up 11 points among debate watchers, but with 42 percent giving him favorable marks, he still remains pretty unpopular. Only Ramaswamy and Asa Hutchinson, the latter of whom did not qualify for last night’s debate, are less popular.Republicans were generally less impressed with candidates’ performances Wednesday than they were after previous debates. Christie, again, was the exception, with 34 percent of watchers saying he performed well, a jump of eight points from the third debate. Debate watchers still liked DeSantis and Haley’s performances the most, with 46 and 45 percent, respectively, saying they performed “excellent” or “very good.” But those numbers were down from the third debate. Ramaswamy’s ratings, meanwhile, have steadily fallen from 55 percent who gave him positive marks in the first debate to 30 percent in the fourth.The 538-Washington Post-Ipsos poll was conducted before and after the Republican debate on Dec. 6. The pre-debate survey was conducted from Nov. 28 to Dec. 5 among a random sample of 5,175 U.S. adults who said they are likely to vote in the Republican primary or caucuses in their state in 2024. The error margin was plus or minus 1.5 points. The post-debate wave was conducted on Dec. 6 and 7 among 763 likely Republican primary or caucus voters who said they watched some or all of the debate.

Washington Post,"Trump appeals Jan. 6 immunity ruling, launching process that may delay trial",2023-12-07 13:08:00,,"Donald Trump filed notice on Thursday saying he will appeal a D.C. judge’s ruling that he was not immune from being charged with federal crimes for his efforts to undo the outcome of the 2020 election, either by his former role as president or the Constitution’s rules for impeachment.The notice is a minor procedural step. But it sets in motion one of the most potentially consequential parts of Trump’s legal saga as the first former president to be charged with crimes. How and when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Supreme Court handle his appeal could have a huge impact on whether Trump — who is again running for president — goes on trial before voters go to the polls in 2024, or ever.Trump’s legal team says the charges that he conspired to obstruct Joe Biden’s 2020 victory should be thrown out for two reasons. First, his lawyers contend that he had presidential immunity. Second, they argue that charging him with trying to block the election results violates the legal principle of double jeopardy, because Trump was already acquitted at his congressional impeachment for his conduct leading up to the riot-marred Jan. 6, 2021, formal tabulation of electoral college votes.U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan’s 48-page opinion last week rejected those claims, as well as a different challenge that said the indictment never should have been filed because it improperly tries to criminalize Trump’s constitutionally protected rights to speech and advocacy as a political candidate.Since a grand jury voted to bring the criminal charges this summer, prosecutors have sought to try Trump as quickly as possible. Trump’s lawyers have insisted their client needs and deserves more time, both as a defendant reviewing evidence and as a former president trying to win back the White House.Appeals courts consider very few legal issues before a criminal case goes to trial and a verdict is reached. But questions of immunity and double jeopardy are often among the exceptions, because if the defendant is right that they cannot be charged, courts have held that they should not be forced to go through a trial at all.And because the Supreme Court has never grappled with some of the legal questions at issue in Trump’s claims — particularly whether a president is immune from indictment and criminal prosecution for actions undertaken while in office, even after he has left office — many lawyers say they believe the courts will have to wrestle with those aspects of the Trump case.The key issue, according to legal experts, is how long will the higher courts consider that question. Trump is scheduled to go on trial in Washington, D.C., starting March 4, and potential jurors in the nation’s capital have received notices that they are being considered for a three-month trial to start on that date. It would be the first of four criminal trials Trump could face, including a federal case involving classified documents in southern Florida; a state-level election-obstruction case in Georgia; and a state-level business fraud case in New York.Now that Trump has filed his notice of appeal on Chutkan’s immunity ruling, the case cannot proceed to trial while the appeals court takes up his claims, legal analysts said. That makes the question of timing especially critical, with the other trials looming and the campaign season soon to be in full swing.Some veteran trial lawyers estimate that if the appeals court rules against Trump and returns the case to Chutkan, it could take weeks more to complete preparations for trial.Based on that calculus, some analysts say the three-judge panel that will hear the appeal first would have to rule on it soon after the New Year for a trial to be completed before next summer’s presidential nominating conventions. That is because Trump is expected, if he loses, to appeal to the full appeals court or the Supreme Court, seeking an injunction to stop the trial case from going forward while his arguments are again considered.Any Supreme Court appeal comes with its own special math: Four of nine justices must agree to consider a case, but five are needed to issue an injunction or ruling.Much remains uncertain. Experts caution that there are so many variables to how the courts could consider the issues involved in Trump’s appeal that it is difficult to make any predictions about how long it will all take.“We’re in a bit of procedural no man’s land, because although an immediate appeal on immunity issues is pretty well standard, the question is, this is a new case, and this is the first time we’ve had a former president indicted,” said Stanley Brand, former House general counsel and now an attorney for several former Trump aides including Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro.Brand, whose law partner is representing Trump’s co-defendant in the classified documents prosecution in Florida, Waltine Nauta, has spent years handling immunity issues in Washington. He put the chances of Trump’s trial occurring by March 4 at “50-50 or less” given the appellate process.It’s December, “and unless there’s expedited consideration, it’s hard to see how you could have any consideration thoughtful enough to consider these novel issues in three months,” Brand said.One critical factor will be which three appellate judges end up hearing the case. If judges can agree on how quickly they want to move forward, such panels can issue decisions in under two months. Other cases, however, can take more than a year.Last week, in a separate ruling issued hours before Chutkan denied Trump’s bid to dismiss the criminal case, the D.C. appeals court denied Trump’s claims of immunity from a civil lawsuit over his conduct leading up to Jan. 6. That decision took 20 months to reach.“The D.C. Circuit can go really fast, I’ve learned that over 45 years of practice,” said Douglas N. Letter, who was House general counsel from 2018 to 2023 and before that was director of the Justice Department civil division’s appellate staff. “On the other hand, sometimes even when it rules in your favor it can wait 10 months to issue even a short opinion.”The legal questions in Trump’s criminal case are different and broader than in the civil matter. The Supreme Court ruled in a case involving President Richard M. Nixon that presidents were immune from lawsuits over actions that fell within the “outer perimeter” of their official duties. But the high court has not addressed the scope of immunity for a president from criminal indictment.Ruling in a precedent setting Watergate-era case, the Supreme Court took only two months in 1974 to uphold then-Chief U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica’s decision that Nixon’s White House tapes could be turned over in a criminal trial subpoena sought by prosecutors. That case, however, was of a more limited question than the Trump appeal. It involved whether a trial subpoena was valid in the case against a defendant close to the president, but not Nixon himself.Still, the high court has shown it can rapidly settle — or duck — complex and controversial cases. It quickly let stand a D.C. Circuit decision turning over Trump’s White House communications records to the House Jan. 6 committee in 2022. And the justices took only one day after oral arguments to issue a ruling that shut down vote-counting in the 2000 election between George Bush and Al Gore.“I could easily see the Supreme Court thinking, ‘We don’t want to get anywhere near this matter now; we’re going to deny review at this point and see what happens at trial,’” Letter said. After a trial, if Trump has been convicted and has not been reelected president, the court could take its time to issue a historic ruling on whether he should be immune from prosecution.The bottom line is that both the appeals court and the Supreme Court would have to act swiftly to allow Trump’s trial to go forward next year.",7888,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/12/07/trump-appeal-trial-immunity/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,wrestle historic reason jury record short opinion back complete insist return uphold jeopardy valid win huge line outcome preparation argument settle remains sought critical expert trial charge stop long injunction close appeal precedent defendant argue full subpoena rule effort electoral deserves thoughtful caution address swiftly handle duck difficult practice represent matter receive start law put panel review violates day prosecution particularly key congressional immunity learn wait exception undertaken poll improperly reelect crime reach file douglas pretty department biden partner waltine consider deny evidence move accord appellate john potential capital aide nation role political southern procedural estimate broader chutkan stand fast stanley prediction set loom indict conduct fell george action complex bit agree limited outer turn obstruct perimeter former bring uncertain civil year duty expedite hard verdict nixon spent claim step scavino client controversial held act result december advocacy fraud prosecutor contend variable official team motion impeachment quickly calculus speech double criminal justice case florida ruling chance immune scope judge force make hear schedule shut convention special factor voter proceed court hand possible forward victory brand college formal expect bid favor division supreme lawyer math hour consequential believe bottom consideration principle legal thrown campaign tape saga president month land date convict question analyst attorney different part acquit presidential easily grapple season lead week trump criminalize conspire timing seek decision challenge constitutionally nauta high richard staff occur vote federal protect include aspect director document sirica rapidly general minor columbia run veteran point impact give circuit loses left georgia constitution juror tabulation notice involve time thursday joe issue washington bush house undo office especially potentially standard letter show donald immediate summer election block oral hearing nominate indictment white march separate business communication classify district counsel reject dismiss lawsuit grand committee,-0.6663,0.11409736308316429,9.627669576897244,0.39537484941154666,0
Washington Post,"Cava, Spain’s sparkling wine, is both affordable and delicious",2023-12-07 13:00:00,Dave McIntyre,"Cava has a conundrum.Spain’s preeminent sparkling wine built a reputation over decades for pleasant, inexpensive bubbly, the kind you’d keep a bottle of in your fridge to take the edge off a lousy day. The problem: When consumers want cheap fizz, they turn to Italy’s prosecco instead of cava.Need proof? The U.S. imported 134 million bottles of prosecco in 2022, an increase of 5.8 percent over the previous year, the Prosecco D.O.C. Consortium announced earlier this year. By contrast, Spain sent 21.6 million bottles of cava to the U.S. market, a decrease of 8.85 percent over 2021, according to the regulatory body of Denominación de Origen Cava, the official appellation.So D.O. Cava’s producers have embarked on a quality push. They want you to know that the word “Cava” on the label doesn’t mean low price and low quality, and that many examples are world-class wines worthy of pairing with fine food. These cavas have always existed, of course; they’ve just been well-kept secrets.“We need to court consumers who want sparkling wines with quality and personality, long-aging and a story,” says Javier Pagés, president of the D.O. Cava regulatory board.This is a belated response to a rebellion by several wineries that withdrew from the organization to get out from under the stereotype of cheap bubbly and market their product as wines of place. Cava is unusual as an appellation in that it refers more to a style of wine — sparkling made in the traditional method of second fermentation in the bottle — not tied to a specific region. While most cava is produced in Penedès, south and west of Barcelona, wines from several other regions across Spain can be labeled as cava.Raventós i Blanc was the initial defector, in 2012, and now labels its wines with its own unofficial designation of Conca del Riu Anoia. Eighteen other wineries later withdrew to label their sparkling wines as Classic Penedès within the official D.O. Penedès appellation. A third group — now totaling 11 wineries, including highly regarded Gramona and Recaredo — joined under the banner Corpinnat. Classic Penedès and Corpinnat emphasize production of their own grapes rather than purchased grapes or base wine, organic farming and extended aging of at least 18 months. They also favor local grape varieties, while D.O. Cava allows chardonnay and pinot noir along with the classic cava blend of xarel-lo, macabeo and parellada.D.O. Cava responded to these challenges with several changes to its labeling regulations, beginning in 2020. First, subzones were approved to give some geographic specifications to a wine’s origin. Two categories were created to indicate quality: Cava de Guarda wines must be aged 9 months in the second fermentation, which creates the bubbles. Cava de Guarda Superior wines are aged longer, and as of 2025 will need to be made exclusively with organic grapes. Within this latter category, Reserva wines must be aged at least 18 months and Gran Reserva a minimum of 30 months. (Longer aging gives the wine added complexity and depth.) Single-vineyard wines aged at least 36 months and approved by a special tasting panel can be labeled Paraje Calificado, considered cava’s highest-quality designation.But wait — there’s more! A new label sticker denotes a winery as “Elaborador Integral,” meaning the winery controls the entire production process from vineyard to vino. Think of this as akin to the popular “grower champagnes,” small producers who make distinctive wines from their own grapes rather than selling grapes to the larger champagne houses.Currently, 15 wineries qualify for the Elaborador Integral sticker. At a recent tasting in Barcelona, I was especially impressed with wines from Alta Alella, Avinyó, Agusti Torelló Mata, Juvé y Camps, Parés Baltà, Torné & Bel and Vins Familia Ferrer.Cava’s producers would have us focus on the Guarda Superior categories as indicators of high-quality cava. If we can find them, that is. According to D.O. Cava’s own statistics, Cava de Guarda — the basic level we have come to know over the decades — accounts for nearly 87 percent of all cava produced. So there isn’t much of this quality tier to find.We have a distinct advantage in our search: Importers have already done the selection for us. Look for cavas represented by your favorite importers — I trust you are reading the back labels and noting names. Some national importers with delicious cavas are Olé & Obrigado, Kobrand and Vintus. Washington, D.C.-area importers with good cava include Grapes of Spain, Free Run Wine Merchants and Well Crafted Wine & Beverage.Will the new categories help cava gain consumers’ respect, or will they prove to be too confusing? Will quality-minded wine lovers be intrigued, or have they concluded that the rebel wineries of Corpinnat and Classic Penedès are the best bubblies Spain has to offer? And will consumers be willing to pay more for the Guarda Superior tiers, or is cava locked in the market’s mind as cheap, low-quality fizz?Time will tell. But these wines are worth seeking out now, and the new labels should help us find them.Cava, Spain’s primary sparkling wine, is a reliable bubbly at an affordable price. To find standouts, look for organic viticulture, “reserva” (extra aging in bottle before release) or different grapes, such as the pinot noir rosé in this week’s selections.Spain, $17Golden in color, with peach, mango and a hint of ginger flavor, a fine bead of bubbles and a medium-long finish to refresh the palate.

Washington Post,Feds calling for Gaza cease-fire face Rubio’s ‘insubordination’ ire,2023-12-07 13:00:00,Joe Davidson,"In today’s apprehensive environment, there may be no topic of discussion more fraught than the Israel-Gaza war.This can be particularly intimidating for federal employees unsure about workplace rules over expressing their opinions, despite a having wider latitude than many realize — including, perhaps, some elected officials.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) fed the intimidation last week with letters to federal offices demanding investigations into more than 500 employees he accused of insubordination because they called for a cease-fire in an open letter previously reported by the New York Times.Meanwhile, Virginia Democratic Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine said they have heard from feds who are “afraid to share their personal views for fear of being targeted for reprisal” or don’t know what they are allowed to say. In Nov. 16 letters to the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), they pressed the Biden administration for “clear guidance … on federal employee self-expression” and assurances they won’t face retaliation “for expressing their personal views in line with that guidance.”OSC issued a clear and definitive advisory opinion last week. The agency enforces the Hatch Act, which defines what activity political activity is allowed and prohibited for federal employees. Specifically, “speaking about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas is not political activity,” OSC’s guidance says, unless that activity is tied to domestic electoral support or action. “And even if the speech is political activity, the Hatch Act only prohibits employees from engaging in that speech while on duty or in the federal workplace.”Noting that President Biden has not called for a cease-fire, Rubio laid serious accusations against the employees. With no supporting evidence, he said “the letter indicates the possibility of open insubordination and misuse of taxpayer provided resources by federal employees attempting to use their roles within the federal government to actively work against policies supported by Congress, the President, and the American people.”Writing to inspectors general and other officials in about two dozen agencies, Rubio said supporting a cease-fire “only stands to benefit Hamas.” He characterized the signers as “disgruntled staffers hiding in anonymity as they advocate for policies aimed at assisting Hamas.” The feds behind the open letter are anonymous, so Rubio can’t know their motivations, and he offered nothing to back his assertions that they are “disgruntled” or Hamas supporters.Rubio’s comments drew pushback from a federal labor leader, Matt Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, who said with the senator’s “extreme response to the open letter, federal workers clearly have good cause to be concerned. This kind of rhetoric toward federal workers from a sitting United States senator certainly won’t help to alleviate their concerns.”If favoring a cease-fire means people are disgruntled Hamas supporters, then that applies to almost two-thirds of the American public. A Nov. 29 Economist/YouGov poll indicates 65 percent of U.S. adult citizens favor a cease-fire, including 58 percent of Republicans. That strong cease-fire support is driven daily by gruesome pictures of devastation, death and destruction by Israel in Gaza, where at least 17,177 people have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. That’s more than 10 times the 1,200 killed during the shocking Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, sparking the latest round in a decades-long battle.“Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed … Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians,” Vice President Harris said in Dubai last week, while condemning Hamas as “a brutal terrorist organization” and supporting Israel’s right of defense.Rubio, again without evidence, also said it is “reasonable to suspect” that feds behind the letter “may also have used their positions and authorities to delay, or even block, implementation of the President’s policies to provide assistance to Israel.”He called for the inspectors general to conduct a full investigation into the open letter and publicize the names of those who backed it. Rubio’s office did not respond to questions in two requests for comment.In his letter to Karen Gorman, acting special counsel in the OSC, Rubio made other unsupported statements, including that employees might have “coordinated … with partisan political actors and/or groups, such as the DNC (Democratic National Committee), while on government time, using government resources.”This is a “reasonable” suspicion, Rubio wrote, because of “the known connections between administration staff and the president’s political allies,” as if those connections are suspicious. There always are connections between staff and the president’s political appointees because they work together every day. Rubio said the feds “could have coordinated the letter with partisan political actors … while on government time, using government resources,” with nothing to support that statement.He pushed the OSC to investigate the letter for potential Hatch Act violations, which does prohibit certain political activities by feds on government time and while using government resources. But it also allows employees political activity on their own time.“As a federal employee under the Hatch Act, you’re permitted to express your views about issues,” Ana Galindo-Marrone, chief of the OSC’s Hatch Act Unit, said in an interview, adding “but while at work or on duty, that would be prohibited if the speech is tied to showing support for candidate support or opposition for candidates or political parties.”The OSC guidance provides specific illustrations of what is and is not allowed for feds at work.“For example,” the advisory opinion says, “it is not political activity for an employee to say, ‘I support/oppose a cease fire between Israel and Hamas and encourage everyone I know to write their Senators and Representatives to build support for that position.’ Similarly, it is not political activity for an employee to say, ‘I support/oppose the administration’s approach to the conflict between Israel and Hamas.’”But federal employees would cross the line, the opinion notes, if they said, ""'I support/oppose a cease fire between Israel and Hamas and encourage everyone I know to vote out any Senators or Representatives who disagree,’ or ‘I support/oppose the administration’s approach to the conflict between Israel and Hamas and therefore will vote for/against President Biden in 2024.’”",6616,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/federal-employees-gaza-ceasefire-rubio-letters/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,rubio heard definitive dozen advisory taxpayer respond response assist innocent share opinion kaine investigation ongoing back line public coordinate request fire kind american apprehensive encourage prohibits dubai accusation agency interview professional strong full rule unit view electoral aim offer biggs open osc partisan labor day express unsure senator write particularly democratic demand inspector actively push poll suspect topic illustration resource dnc possibility motivation biden realize evidence harris pushback accord cross implementation benefit fed potential worker late role political federation gaza characterize enforces build stand prohibit conduct indicates action republican congress advocate international applies candidate round concerned staffer similarly publicize national gruesome accuse press picture opposition duty assurance supporter palestinian shock misuse warner specifically rhetoric act condemn report driven clear drew official leader marco suspicious vice despite afraid intimidate alleviate speech appointee kill attack make special chief discussion ally hamas policy administration brutal favor guidance tim workplace assertion laid tie ana adult united fear work terrorist israel fraught mark support president violation question devastation add environment comment death group extreme week hiding state suspicion personal delay permit citizen elect hatch representative staff destruction note speak intimidation retaliation disgruntle reprisal york position vote latitude federal anonymous include protect percent virginia specific general activity connection engage gorman previously defines government personnel employee health technical management disagree time statement issue cease office ministry domestic authority today target insubordination engineer spark provide letter show reasonable matt daily block signer wider conflict approach investigate anonymity attempt counsel call organization unsupported actor civilian assistance committee,-0.22950000000000004,0.3174123337363966,11.728419273034657,0.4007600077824797,0
Washington Post,"CNN, ABC to host GOP presidential debates in Iowa and New Hampshire",2023-12-07 12:47:00,,"Two networks announced Thursday that they would host Republican presidential debates next month in early nominating states, offering some contenders additional opportunities to sway voters after Wednesday night’s debate in Tuscaloosa, Ala., which might be the last one this cycle sponsored by the Republican National Committee.CNN announced plans for two debates: the first in Des Moines on Jan. 10, less than a week before the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses for Republicans; the second in Goffstown, N.H., on Jan. 21, ahead of the Granite State’s primary.ABC News said it would team up with a local television station to host a debate in the Manchester, N.H., area, on Jan. 18, in coordination with the New Hampshire State Republican Committee.Wednesday night’s debate was the fourth sponsored by the RNC, and the party has not announced any additional sanctioned debates. The RNC has partnered with various media organizations for its four debates but maintained strict control over the process.Four Republican candidates — former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy — took the stage in Tuscaloosa. Former president Donald Trump skipped the event, as he did with the previous three debates.To qualify for the CNN debates, candidates must meet polling standards set by the network that could result in smaller affairs than Wednesday night’s.ABC said it would announce qualification standards and other details later.To this point, Republican candidates have been subject to an RNC exclusivity pledge. Any candidate who participates in a non-sanctioned debate risks being barred from future events hosted by the RNC.However, RNC officials have been considering loosening rules to allow candidates to take part in other debates without penalty.DeSantis has been among the critics of the current RNC rules and said he is open to “more freewheeling debates” outside the official party system, even proposing a one-on-one, hour-long debate with Trump. DeSantis has said he wants debates before both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, which the RNC has not committed to organizing.Meanwhile, Trump and his advisers have repeatedly pressured the RNC to stop having debates, and Trump has expressed frustration that Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and the committee have continued the process.McDaniel and her allies say she has tried to hold fair debates and be “neutral” in the nominating process.In the 2016 primary season, the Republican Party hosted 12 debates. There was one each month from August to December 2015, and then two in January, three in February and two in March of the following year.",2708,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/republican-debates-cnn/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,tuscaloosa sponsor goffstown meet florida neutral caucus mcdaniel party fair voter ahead stop ally cycle strict chairwoman continued haley early jersey network opportunity qualify plan participates rule entrepreneur exclusivity commit primary contender vivek sway chris previous system pressure president open month christie maintain freewheel part frustration governor adviser express debate presidential cnn critic season coordination week fourth nikki gov polling state trump risk wednesday host manchester medium control repeatedly station rnc partner consider moines local loosening august future event small ron point stage night current hampshire set february iowa announce television thursday hold republican subject additional detail candidate bar ronna news desantis sanction standard donald national qualification former propose offering affair skip year nominate ramaswamy march follow granite ambassador tech result december january pledge area organization official committee team,0.016550000000000002,0.0,12.724473118279569,0.268510101010101,0
Washington Post,"After skipping GOP debate, Donald Trump shows up at N.Y. fraud trial",2023-12-07 12:20:00,,"Donald Trump, the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, attended the New York civil fraud trial in which he is a defendant on Thursday, a day after he skipped the latest GOP presidential debate.Trump, two of his adult children and his namesake business, the Trump Organization, are being sued by New York Attorney General Letitia James in connection with allegedly inflating property values for years to secure better terms on bank loans and insurance.The former president has attended several days of trial testimony, including when Michael Cohen, his former fixer-turned-nemesis, testified against him. Trump testified on Nov. 6 as James’s office was presenting its case, a combative appearance in which New York State Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron repeatedly admonished him to answer questions directly and avoid making long-winded political statements.Trump is expected to be called to the stand as a defense witness on Monday, with trial testimony concluding shortly after that. Engoron is expected to decide this part of the case in early 2024. Because it is a civil trial and not a criminal matter, the defendants do not face jail time.Trump separately has been charged in four criminal cases — involving allegations of election obstruction, mishandling of classified documents and attempting to cover up a hush money payment during the 2016 presidential campaign — and several trials are scheduled for next year.In the $250 million New York civil case, Engoron has ruled that Trump and his company committed fraud. The trial is exploring whether specific illegal acts were committed as part of that fraud and will determine any potential penalties.Trump’s latest courtroom appearance came a day after the fourth Republican presidential debate. He skipped the showdown in keeping with his practice this year of refusing to participate in such events. With less than six weeks until the first nominating contest, Trump leads the polls in the GOP race, besting his closest competitors by wide margins in key early states and nationally.The debate Wednesday featured four candidates who spent much of their time tussling with one another and landed few blows against Trump. With little time left to dent his wide lead before party primaries and caucuses begin, the candidates are essentially in a battle for a distant second, at least for the moment.Trump has used the New York civil trial as well as the 91 criminal charges he faces as a rallying cry in the campaign, portraying himself without evidence as the victim of an unjust political hit job. Such tactics have resonated with the GOP base, according to polling, as well as interviews with voters and others.Increasingly, the lines between Trump’s strategy for navigating his civil and criminal cases and his campaign blueprint have blurred. He has used courtroom appearances to amplify grievances and other messages he frequently brings up on the trail, and to draw attention away from his rivals.And at campaign events, Trump often references his legal situation. Even as he skipped the debate, he has been a focal point in the race this week.",3140,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/12/07/trump-ny-trial-appearance/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,allegation victim payment tactic grievance criminal case defense inflate obstruction engoron closest navigate line portray cover caucus judge party appearance make essentially schedule trial charge jail competitor voter wide court distant illegal tussle expect showdown early supreme feature draw interview courtroom cry refuse adult defendant nomination separately dent rule combative commit secure situation trail primary allegedly legal shortly campaign company directly president determine resonate land practice job question matter attorney gop part day message property presidential debate loan key namesake base term mishandle lead fourth child week contest polling poll state value participate trump conclude focal wednesday avoid letitia hush present repeatedly begin besting decide monday cohen evidence accord york include event witness potential brings late document specific general political connection point attention left money stand answer james arthur million involve explore thursday time republican blueprint race hit candidate office bank frequently testimony testify margin reference donald former admonish rally civil election skip year blur spent nominate battle amplify michael strategy unjust away act business attend classify attempt call blow organization fraud,-0.8477,0.09554140127388534,12.074715596330275,0.3602272727272728,0
Washington Post,"Two Russians charged with hacking, trying to meddle in 2019 U.K. election",2023-12-07 12:10:00,,"Two Russian nationals have been charged with attempting to hack the computers of employees of multiple U.S. government agencies and allied countries around the world, in part to steal and release documents to interfere with elections in Britain in 2019.U.S. officials said one of the men, Ruslan Aleksandrovich Peretyatko, is an officer in the FSB, the Russian intelligence service. Peretyatko was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Francisco on Tuesday along with another man, Andrey Stanislavovich Korinets.Together, the men are accused of coordinating the “Callisto Group,” which sent spear-phishing emails to current and former military and government officials, as well as think-tank employees, journalists and others, with the intention of hacking computers and releasing the information they were able to steal.Officials said the two men are at large and believed to be in Russia. They are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Both also face financial sanctions in the United States and the United Kingdom.The charges are the latest Justice Department action taken to disrupt Russian efforts to hack computers in the West and influence democratic elections in the United States and elsewhere. In 2018, 12 Russian intelligence officials were indicted and charged with hacking computers to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Officials said the Callisto Group was active from at least October 2016 through October 2022. Their alleged activities targeted a range of U.S. agencies, including intelligence agencies, the State Department and the Department of Energy. In some cases, officials said the hacking efforts were successful, including at the Department of Energy and think tanks in the U.K.Among Callisto Group’s aims, officials said, was to conduct a malign influence campaign that would disrupt the U.K. elections in 2019, when Britain was trying to leave the European Union trade bloc and strike out on its own. They said Callisto Group, also known as Star Blizzard, works on behalf of a division of the Russian FSB called Center 18.“Through this malign influence activity directed at the democratic processes of the United Kingdom, Russia again demonstrates its commitment to using weaponized campaigns of cyberespionage against such networks in unacceptable ways,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen.The charges were unsealed on the same day that David Cameron, the U.K foreign secretary, is in Washington to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken to discuss support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.British officials summoned the Russian ambassador to brief him on the results of the joint investigation and complain about Russian cyber activities, which they described as an aggressive — but largely unsuccessful — campaign to disrupt British politics, dating to 2015, U.S. officials said.In a statement, the Russian embassy called the allegations “invented claims,” adding that because of the “absence of concrete evidence it saw no reason to regard these insinuations as credible.”British officials said the spear phishing campaign targeted multiple candidates for Parliament and included the stealing and releasing of British-U.S. trade documents before the 2019 election, in which trade was a key issue.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn pointed to U.S.-U.K. trade documents — which he said he received through a Freedom of Information request — as evidence that Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party “were going to sell our National Health Service out to the United States and big pharma.”",3628,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/12/07/british-election-russian-hack-indicted/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country european allegation reason steal blizzard jury meet investigation absence case justice russia francisco russian coordinate range unacceptable request party discus charge blinken phishing officer demonstrates foreign sell joint service large described division boris largely agency network interfere influence britain successful weaponize united aleksandrovich commit concrete leave believe journalist work effort antony aim spear corbyn support parliament campaign embassy unsealed politics tuesday regard date email disrupt cyberespionage assistant attorney add receive part johnson ruslan allege day group david presidential democratic key multiple release state matthew malign trade san union stanislavovich financial conspiracy department aggressive strike big allied evidence fraud information federal process include energy active military late document general activity cameron summon point andrey october government tank current kingdom world intention employee bloc indict secretary health conduct west action commitment statement washington fsb candidate hack star callisto unsuccessful invent target intelligence conservative sanction computer center cyber national accuse former count behalf insinuation election peretyatko claim direct freedom ukraine jeremy attempt ambassador result pharma call british wire complain grand official leader,0.8973,0.33076074972436603,13.375344262295084,0.2773199023199023,0
Washington Post,This chicken paprikash lightens up a classic but keeps the big flavor,2023-12-07 12:00:00,Ellie Krieger,"My sister brought me back a prime gift from her recent trip to Hungary: a fist-sized, linen sack stuffed with sweet paprika. Now I realize why it is such a celebrated spice. Comparing it to the plastic jar of generic paprika sitting in my pantry for who knows how long, it was more brilliantly red, aromatic and markedly sweeter tasting, without the bitter undertone I had not, until then, realized my usual one had.Paprika, which is made from dried, ground peppers, is often categorized as sweet, hot or smoked, but it can vary as widely as peppers themselves. Regardless of provenance, along with rich color and savory flavor, the spice brims with health benefits. It’s especially rich in carotenoids, which impart paprika’s distinctive color, and polyphenols, plant compounds — both of which play a key role in preventing chronic disease.Upon receiving this culinary treasure, my natural impulse was to cook the dish that was designed to put it front and center, Hungarian paprikash, a sumptuous pot of braised chicken in a creamy paprika sauce. My recipe here takes the lead from that traditional dish, but in a lighter, more vegetable-packed take.To make it, you brown slices of boneless, skinless chicken thighs in olive oil, then transfer them to a plate to make room for heaps of sliced onion and colorful bell peppers. Once they soften, you add garlic, then return the chicken to the pan, along with a generous amount of the paprika, a bit of cayenne pepper and chicken broth. After a 10-minute simmer to cook the chicken through and meld the flavors, you stir in some yogurt to create a creamy, red-orange sauce with a lovely, gentle tang. (The traditional dish uses sour cream, which you could absolutely substitute here if you prefer. I chose chicken thighs because they stay moist and tender when braised, but you could swap them for sliced chicken breast. In that case, I suggest cutting the simmer time a bit so the chicken doesn’t overcook.)Served over egg noodles, or with a hunk of crusty bread, and garnished with a spray of parsley, this stew of tender chicken, peppers and onions in a luxuriously creamy, brilliant-red paprika sauce now ranks as one of my family’s favorite meals. You can make it with whatever type of paprika you have on hand, but I think it is worth treating yourself to the Hungarian sweet kind for next-level flavor.And since it’s the holiday season, keep in mind that the premium spice sure does make a nice gift.",2456,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/12/07/chicken-paprikash-hungarian-food/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,recipe moist generic paprikash jar impart back case soften return polyphenols trip paprika markedly overcook distinctive celebrate amount make cayenne swap stay kind broth cook suggest long simmer hand natural rank hot thigh generous nice plant type pantry garnish pan colorful recent egg linen compare family plastic yogurt vary impulse hungarian luxuriously meld color cream front add receive put braise traditional sour chronic creamy transfer key slice savory hunk sister season ground lead prefer sweet boneless treasure brim serve room worth premium crusty spray realize tang stew prime hungary benefit dry categorize oil prevent chose noodle role lighter brown lovely undertone stir substitute carotenoid bell smoke widely provenance pepper red bitter health plate breast cut time holiday culinary bit brought play gentle design gift sumptuous olive favorite spice especially tender dish onion center taste skinless heap absolutely parsley meal mind rich garlic brilliantly create sweeter treat sack aromatic stuffed chicken sauce compound bread flavor usual,0.9961,0.0,7.955655737704916,0.632367149758454,0
Washington Post,UNLV gunman was a professor who had applied repeatedly for a job,2023-12-07 11:39:00,,"A former business professor who repeatedly sought a position at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and other higher education institutions in the state has been identified as the gunman in the UNLV campus shooting that left three faculty members dead Wednesday, Sheriff Kevin McMahill announced Thursday afternoon.Anthony Polito, who had taught in North Carolina and Georgia before unsuccessfully seeking a job in Nevada, shot four people on three floors of the Lee Business School in a matter of minutes, McMahill detailed in a news briefing. The 67-year-old Polito arrived on campus after first visiting a post office in nearby Henderson, where he sent 22 letters with no return address to various university personnel across the country, the sheriff said. Polito was later killed by police.One letter already has been retrieved. It contained an unknown white powder, which the sheriff said was being tested.The names of two victims were confirmed Thursday by the Clark County coroner’s office. Patricia Navarro Velez, 39, who died of multiple gunshot wounds, had been an assistant professor in accounting since 2019. Cha-Jan “Jerry” Chang, 64, who was shot in the head, was an associate business professor who had taught at the university for more than two decades.The third dead victim also has been identified, but officials were withholding the name pending notification of next of kin. McMahill said the fourth victim, a 38-year-old visiting professor, remains hospitalized, with his condition downgraded on Thursday to life-threatening.The shooting began just before noon Wednesday on the fourth floor of Beam Hall, home of the business school, and sent students and staff fleeing or into lockdown for several hours. Officials emphasized that the toll could have been much higher given how many people were in the building at the time. They said students were not targeted — though McMahill said he believed Polito “was probably heading toward” the nearby student union as he exited Beam.University and city officers engaged and fatally shot the gunman just outside of the business school, as seen in a video played at the briefing. McMahill said Polito had brought a 9mm handgun — legally purchased last year — and 11 magazines of ammunition to the campus. Nine magazines were found on him after he was killed.McMahill noted that officials who executed a search warrant of Polito’s apartment in Henderson found ammunition and several computers. There also was a chair with an arrow pointing down to a document “similar to a last will and testament,” he said. Polito had a list of people whom he was seeking on the UNLV campus as well as at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., where he taught for 16 years.“None of the individuals listed on the target list became a victim,” the sheriff said.The gunman appeared to be struggling financially since an eviction notice was on the front door of his apartment, the sheriff said.A LinkedIn page for Polito identified him as “semiretired university professor” and noted his three degrees, including a doctorate from the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business. From 2001 to early 2017, it said, he was an associate professor at East Carolina University and taught courses in operations and supply chain management.“The greatest gifts and takeaways I possess from my many years within higher education are the many kind & positive comments students made regarding my instruction and disposition toward them,” Polito wrote.The page was taken down midmorning Thursday.A biosketch page that he’d also posted online, with a Las Vegas P.O. box, listed his doctorate as concentrated in operations management. Before his years in academia, he worked for companies such as Volvo and Kellogg, Brown & Root, according to the biography.Polito maintained a wide-ranging personal website that included more details about his life. One section detailed his travels: “Hard to believe, looking back, but I had the pleasure of making more than two dozen trips to Vegas over the last fifteen years. I don’t gamble that much, but there is plenty to do there, that’s for sure !! Over those years, my steel trap mind collected more information and trivia about Vegas than probably anyone in this state east of I-95 (at least)!”UNLV has canceled classes and most other activities through Sunday. A message posted online said “there will continue to be a strong police presence and activity on the main campus today as the investigation into Wednesday’s incident continues.”",4524,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/12/07/unlv-shooter-anthony-polito-professor/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZ7UJFM5H653U44S3SX6YKBFKU_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZ7UJFM5H653U44S3SX6YKBFKU_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZ7UJFM5H653U44S3SX6YKBFKU_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZ7UJFM5H653U44S3SX6YKBFKU_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZ7UJFM5H653U44S3SX6YKBFKU_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZ7UJFM5H653U44S3SX6YKBFKU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country police dozen condition wound pleasure investigation back minute return continue patricia gunshot instruction remains sought kind sunday handgun toll hall similar strong detailed financially campus unlv plenty address gamble company institution regard front struggle maintain matter assistant vega semiretired kevin cancel course multiple school travel root notification wednesday faculty positive emphasize repeatedly presence head begin accounting ammunition accord information probably video brown mcmahill floor supply midmorning coroner jerry student operation home university box north polito carolina page velez steel execute confirm website former search unknown life mind year hard shoot kellogg post dead beam member found chain flee official victim visit nearby associate arrow fifteen trip kill retrieve hospitalize lee make disposition henderson section purchase city college professor fatally testament early apartment lockdown online degree hour believe work county education chair unsuccessfully job comment posse withholding message chang building volvo incident fourth state personal gunman trivia powder terry seek downgrade union identify legally high doctorate staff academia note collect position include biosketch document linkedin pending activity taught engage point noon give left played arrive personnel class georgia navarro individual sheriff concentrate nevada notice announce clark management time thursday brought detail gift contain office today greenville shot news target computer letter exit eviction east takeaway list warrant white magazine business great briefing officer trap,0.19074999999999998,0.1989389920424403,10.576650485436893,0.3310997910135841,0
Washington Post,"Romeo and Juliet, two elderly manatees, get a happy ending",2023-12-07 11:36:00,Maggie Penman,"For months, Romeo, a sexagenarian manatee, spent his days alone swimming in circles in a small tank at a Miami aquarium. Stuck in another tank was Juliet, also in her 60s, along with a third manatee.For the aquatic mammals, though, there is a happier ending than in Shakespeare’s play.After their living conditions at the Miami Seaquarium came under scrutiny from federal officials and animal welfare advocates, a team of veterinarians and animal care specialists this week transported Romeo, Juliet and the other manatee, Clarity, to new homes at ZooTampa and SeaWorld in Orlando, two animal critical care facilities.The move, which involved a crane, heavy-duty stretchers and a squad of hard-hat-clad workers, comes after a public campaign against the Miami Seaquarium. Over the past three years, Agriculture Department inspectors had called out the facility for failing to properly protect the animals in its care, including an orca they said was fed rotten fish and forced to train and perform with injuries. The whale, named Tokitae, died earlier this year before she could be released into the wild.“The more I dug into it, the more I was concerned,” said Pat Rose, an aquatic biologist who heads the Save the Manatee Club, a Florida-based group involved in the rescue.Under the direction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the complex relocation was in the works for months. The agency said the transport of the elderly animals was “high-risk, but necessary” for their welfare.The manatees arrived at the Seaquarium in the late 1950s, before the signing of the Endangered Species Act in 1973. Manatees are gentle but curious creatures, a quality that can be a detriment to them because of the dangers posed by humans and speedboats, said Joseph Gaspard, the vice president of zoological operations at SeaWorld Orlando.As a result of being “pre-Act” manatees, the pair were owned by the Miami Seaquarium, which opened in 1955. That meant that barring a lengthy and complicated legal process, their owners had to give the animals up voluntarily in order for them to be relocated.The Seaquarium, which offers marine-life shows and exhibits for visitors, has come under criticism in recent years because of the conditions animals are kept in behind the scenes. During an inspection in July, the Agriculture Department, which oversees animal welfare, noted the facility failed to protect its manatees from direct sunlight, which can be harmful to the animals’ eye and skin health, and didn’t have enough trained employees.In a detail that caught the attention of animal welfare activists, the agency also said Romeo had been left in a small pool alone since the spring. Afterward, UrgentSeas, an activist group, posted drone footage of the male manatee floating around in a bare enclosure. The video went viral, sparking outrage.“Manatees are semi-social animals and do better medically and psychologically when they are housed in pairs or groups,” the Agriculture Department report stated. “Marine mammals, whenever known to be primarily social in the wild, must be housed in their primary enclosure with at least one compatible animal of the same or biologically related species.”The agency had noted in previous inspection reports in 2022 and 2021 that tanks were in need of repairs.Guillermo Sanchez, the chief veterinary officer for the Dolphin Company, the current owner of the Miami Seaquarium, said the company “did everything to assure the best of the best"" for the manatees. In the midst of the public campaign to rescue Romeo, it decided that included moving the animals elsewhere.Fish and Wildlife, which has jurisdiction over Clarity under the Endangered Species and Marine Mammal Protection Acts, had made plans for her to be relocated months ago, the Miami Seaquarium said in a statement. That would leave Juliet alone, which is not recommended, or in a tank with Romeo, which the Seaquarium said is not advised since breeding is prohibited. “Since no other options were available for both Romeo and Juliet, we believed it is best for them to be transferred to a facility that could host them in a social group,” the company said.The operation presented some weighty challenges. Romeo is about 2,100 pounds, and Juliet is 3,100.First, their pools had to be mostly drained so the animals could be tucked safely onto stretchers and lifted by a crane. Cynthia Stringfield, a veterinarian who oversees conservation efforts at ZooTampa, Romeo and Juliet’s new home, said there were a lot of nerves ahead of the big move.“We knew we could accommodate him pretty well, but with her we had to do special rigging on our crane,” Stringfield said.After removing the manatees from their pools, specialists loaded the animals into trucks, where they were monitored and kept wet throughout the journey. At the other end, the manatees were loaded into the tanks that will be their new homes for now.“It was a long day for both of them,” Stringfield said. “But they were both troopers. They came through it, no problem at all.”Once in their new tanks, the manatees swam around and inspected their new surroundings, which included other manatee companions. Juliet loves calves, said Springfield, and the female manatee now shares an enclosure with an orphan calf the workers in Tampa have been bottle feeding.“They’re very resilient animals,” she said. “They just were like, ‘Okay, this is where I live now. These are my new friends. And that was an interesting day.’”Rose hopes that the interest in Romeo and Juliet leads to more concern for manatees in the wild. In recent years the population has struggled because of injuries from boats and the pollution of seagrass they feed on, which led to mass starvation over the past few years. In 2017, the government determined manatees had recovered enough to be removed from the Endangered Species List, but Rose says that move was premature.",5894,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/07/romeo-juliet-manatee-rescue/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Climate and Environment,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,romeo visitor boat seaquarium available lot spring condition share inspect wildlife veterinary seagrass recommend circle springfield public compatible orlando owner mammal mass resilient critical advise ahead facility monitor long service dolphin stretcher caught agency joseph urgentseas population trooper tampa leave primary effort female zootampa orca tucked medically company biologically offer open bottle companion struggle stuck day swam meant transfer release inspector specialist relocate clarity lift psychologically afterward journey pose present pretty department train head move live fed worker late video past miami small fish signing creature calf living current agriculture operation prohibit home scene properly complex sunlight dug advocate specie bar midst truck concerned ago drone exhibit gaspard knew year breeding spent direct post welfare quality related act harmful result report nerve surroundings official tokitae scrutiny team vice lengthy interest accommodate social drain recover squad premature male oversees jurisdiction pollution force assure make special chief aquatic fail officer aquarium july happier seaworld whale eye marine concern perform direction plan criticism crane stringfield elderly recent relocation wet believe work inspection shakespeare detriment option friend curious legal campaign previous pound president determine conservation month feed voluntarily sexagenarian viral group complicate juliet pool love lead week state remove orphan transport host sanchez protection veterinarian challenge save animal injury big note decide earlier process federal protect include pat danger starvation wild swim primarily safely attention tank enclosure give government left arrive footage skin health involve club order load endanger statement gentle weighty detail house rescue float spark problem show pair rig rotten speedboat list cynthia hope biologist human manatee rise zoological call activist,0.9863500000000001,0.5598914149983033,9.710685920577621,0.3970610558272895,0
Washington Post,Hunter Biden indicted on federal tax evasion charges in California,2023-12-07 20:23:00,,"Special counsel David Weiss has filed a second indictment against President Biden’s son Hunter, this time on tax charges, as the continued fallout from a collapsed plea deal this summer means the younger Biden could go on trial twice next year while his father runs for reelection.The president’s son was charged by a grand jury in California with nine counts of failing to file and pay taxes, tax evasion and filing false tax returns; three of the charges are felonies, and another six are misdemeanors.Prosecutors accuse Hunter Biden of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes from 2016 through 2019. According to the 56-page indictment, Hunter Biden earned more than $7 million in gross income between 2016 and 2020 from foreign business deals, including payments for his service on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma and his work for a Chinese energy conglomerate. He also received another $1.2 million in 2020 and spent the money to fund an “extravagant lifestyle,” including drugs, escorts and girlfriends, exotic cars and clothing, the indictment alleges.The $1.2 million came from a personal friend, according to prosecutors, who routed the money to third parties and then to Hunter Biden, who allegedly spent the funds rent for a “lavish house” in Venice, Calif., and car payments for a Porsche. The indictment charges that he also earned more than $140,000 in payments for his memoir, “Beautiful Things.”Instead of paying his tax bills, however, prosecutors allege that Hunter Biden failed to file taxes on time for a number of years. When he finally filed his tax returns in 2018, the indictment alleges, they included false business deductions that reduced his tax liability. The charges were first reported by CNN.Some of the conduct described in the indictment dates to when Hunter Biden had said he was struggling with depression and addicted to drugs. But prosecutors charge that even after he has said he was sober and building a new life in Los Angeles, he failed to fully pay taxes he owed.In a statement, Hunter Biden’s lawyer Abbe Lowell said his client repaid his taxes in full two years ago and that Weiss had not granted Lowell’s request days ago for a “customary meeting” to discuss the tax investigation. A spokesperson for Weiss declined to comment on that allegation.“Based on the facts and the law, if Hunter’s last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought,” Lowell said. He promised to address issues with the case in court.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.The tax charges had been expected since the failure of the plea deal, which would have allowed Hunter Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax crimes and admit to illegally possessing a gun — without actually pleading guilty to the felony gun offense.After that deal collapsed over a disagreement about whether it would immunize Biden from additional criminal charges, Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware overseeing the case, sought and received special counsel status from the Justice Department. That change in his status signaled there would probably be indictments in multiple jurisdictions.Weiss announced an indictment against Biden in mid-September on charges of illegal gun possession and making false statements on a form he filled out to buy a revolver in 2018.The dual indictments add an additional layer of complexity and drama to the 2024 presidential race, with the son of the Democratic incumbent facing two potential criminal trials on opposite coasts, and the leading Republican presidential contender, former president Donald Trump, scheduled for three criminal trials so far in 2024, after being indicted by four different grand juries this year.The investigation of Hunter Biden has been a focal point for Republicans since the 2020 presidential campaign, with GOP politicians including Trump claiming that the younger Biden’s legal troubles are evidence of criminal corruption within the Biden family.But multiple inquiries on Capitol Hill have failed to publicly surface significant evidence of wrongdoing by the sitting president, and the indictment filed Thursday does not link him to any alleged criminal behavior.Republican lawmakers have accused the Justice Department of showing preferential treatment to the president’s son, an allegation Attorney General Merrick Garland has strenuously denied.Lowell and House Republicans exchanged angry statements Wednesday over whether Hunter Biden will testify before Congress next week.

Washington Post,News investigations say Israeli tank shell killed journalist in Lebanon,2023-12-07 11:25:00,Mohamad El Chamaa,"BEIRUT — News organizations and rights groups that investigated shelling that killed a journalist and injured others in Lebanon in October said their findings indicate that Israel was responsible.Two rights groups described the attack as a “war crime.”The shelling on Oct. 13 in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah, 37, and severely wounded Agence France-Presse photographer Christina Assi, 28. Other journalists from Reuters, AFP and Al Jazeera were also injured.Representatives of Reuters, AFP, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International appeared at a packed news conference in the Lebanese capital Thursday morning to jointly present the findings of their separate investigations into the attack on the journalists. Present in the audience were Abdallah’s family members, as well as Al Jazeera cameraman Elie Brakhya, who was injured Oct. 13, with one arm still in a cast and the other bandaged.After a moment of silence to mourn journalists killed in the conflict, Dylan Collins, an AFP videographer who was with Abdallah when he was killed, recounted the events of that day, saying he was there “to serve as a witness to what happened.”He and his colleague Assi, as well as Abdallah, had set up on a hilltop near Alma al-Chaab, where they found the Al Jazeera crew broadcasting as well.“We felt safe, we felt secure, so we got to work, seven journalists, all of us wearing flak jackets and helmets, everyone clearly marked as a member of the press,” he said. “The Israelis knew we were there from the moment we arrived.”Shortly before 6 p.m. local time, Collins said, they turned their cameras west as the sun was setting.“There was smoke, and then boom, we were hit,” he said. Collins said he went to tend to Assi, who was on the ground screaming that “she couldn’t feel her legs.” While tending to her wounds, a second strike hit the Al Jazeera car next to them, Collins said. “I looked up and saw a leg next to the Al Jazeera car, which I later realized belonged to Issam.”They did not find his body until the ambulance came, Collins added. “He was blown through the wall he was standing next to. He landed amid the rubble, his body charred almost beyond recognition.”Assi is still in a hospital recovering from her wounds, Collins said. He read a message that she asked him to pass on: “We choose journalism with a mission to deliver the truth, and despite the inevitable costs, our commitment remains unwavering. Nothing can silence us.”The investigations by the four groups drew on analysis from munitions experts, satellite images, witness testimony and images captured at the scene before and after the attacks.Reuters said in its report Thursday that “an Israeli tank crew killed a Reuters journalist and wounded six reporters in Lebanon on Oct. 13 by firing two shells in quick succession from Israel while the journalists were filming cross-border shelling.”Reuters said it obtained evidence from the scene, including shrapnel on the ground and embedded in a Reuters car, three flak jackets, a camera, tripod and a large piece of metal. The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, a research institute that tests and analyzes munitions, found that the metal piece “was the tail fin of a 120mm tank round fired by a smoothbore tank gun positioned 1.34 km away from the reporters, across the Lebanese border,” Reuters said.Reuters editor in chief Alessandra Galloni condemned the killing in a statement and called on “Israel to explain how this could have happened and to hold to account those responsible.”AFP, which conducted its separate investigation in partnership with Airwars, a human rights nonprofit based in Britain, said the evidence it collected on the deadly strikes “points to a tank round used only by the Israeli army in this high-tension border region.”AFP said in its report that it was able to come to “three key conclusions.” One is that the munition that killed Abdallah was of Israeli origin and “is not used by any other groups in the region.” Another, it said, is that “the strikes were deliberate and targeted,” coming close together in time and space and hitting journalists who “were clearly identified as press, away from any military activity.” Finally, it said, “the strikes likely came from southeast of the journalists’ position, apparently near the Israeli village of Jordeikh where Israeli tanks were operating.”Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher for Human Rights Watch, told the news conference that the evidence reviewed by his organization shows “that the Israeli army knew or should have known that the people they were firing on were civilians and journalists.”Human Rights Watch said in a statement Thursday that the journalists “were well removed from ongoing hostilities, clearly identifiable as members of the media, and had been stationary for at least 75 minutes before they were hit by two consecutive strikes.” It said it found “no evidence of a military target near the journalists’ location.”Amnesty International made similar points and said the attack “must be investigated as a war crime.” It said that even though “the group was visibly identifiable as journalists,” the Israeli military “attacked them anyway in two separate strikes 37 seconds apart.”At a news conference Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was “deeply sorry for this loss.”“It is important and appropriate that it [the strike] be fully and thoroughly investigated,” Blinken said.Eylon Levy, a spokesman for Israel’s government, said Thursday that he was not familiar with the findings of the investigations but said Israel respects international law and does not target civilians. The Israel Defense Forces previously said it was investigating the incident, and a spokesman for the Israeli military said in October it was “very sorry” for the journalist’s death but that it was not sure who was responsible.The Washington Post has not independently reviewed the material that investigators found at the scene.An eyewitness told The Post at the time that the strikes came from the Israeli side and that there was no indication that fire from Lebanon was coming from anywhere near the journalists.Video posted at the time also indicated that several reporters at the site were wearing blue bullet-resistant vests marked with the word “Press.” The Associated Press — which had a photographer at the scene — reported that an Israeli shell landed near the group during an exchange of fire with Hezbollah.Assi suffered “life-changing injuries including the amputation of her leg,” Collins told the news conference. He said the strikes left the other journalists in the group with “shrapnel wounds and other scars.”When asked who should investigate the attack, Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said that “Israel is obligated to investigate and hold members of its military accountable.” She asked Lebanese authorities to make the technical report they prepared after the incident available to the public.Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty also asked the United States to investigate the incident because a U.S. national, Dylan Collins, was targeted.Dozens of journalists have been killed as a result of the war in Gaza — at such a high rate that the Committee to Protect Journalists, which tracks reported deaths and injuries of journalists in conflict, said October was “the deadliest month for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.” The CPJ said Wednesday that at least 63 journalists and media workers have been killed and 11 injured since the war began Oct. 7.",7632,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/reuter-journalist-issam-abdallah-killed-lebanon-israel-attack/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,army available wound investigation respect ongoing minute char fire satellite remains independently partnership scream side expert track tail hostility finding close nonprofit large described severely scientific origin smoothbore body audience britain similar moment ramzi happen africa jacket deputy antony shortly leg christina km mourn law review day metal amid told cost key cameraman amnesty majzoub cast wednesday medium colleague present film explain realize cpj strike silence reporter begin deliver local evidence succession inevitable embed event witness capital military worker fin hilltop apparently gaza southern october issam stand set suffer injured deliberate secretary conduct ambulance west spokesman north scene commitment reuters international levy site round helmet test lebanese collins wall israeli border turn rubble obtain national knew press alessandra lebanon gun quick galloni post assi regional away member condemn deeply result report found drew felt middle prepared despite belong flak rate dylan village fully associate recover visibly defense amputation photographer morning sorry blown kill journalism attack shell munition force make jointly blinken chief kaiss analysis exchange deadliest analyzes appropriate united family gathering videographer safe secure sun indication journalist work vest israel boom alma choose wear month land add blue data death group message find research shrapnel base elie agence incident ground netherlands southeast beirut conference crew state serve remove finally jordeikh image abdallah identify injury feel high identifiable car word obligate piece brakhya position afp collect researcher protect include marked hospital director material space important unwavering point tank government previously left smoke packed account indicate deadly technical time hold thursday familiar statement camera washington hit airwars mission authority tend news tripod truth target testimony show apply watch eyewitness east arm investigator jazeera recount conflict human capture investigate separate institute read call stationary consecutive organization editor civilian broadcasting committee,-0.98135,0.43238993710691825,10.618568391211909,0.314780753968254,0
Washington Post,"Virginia gets $729 million federal boost for Potomac bridge, other rail projects",2023-12-07 11:10:00,,"Virginia has received $729 million in federal money that advances a plan to boost train capacity over the Potomac River and grow passenger rail operations within the decade, members of the state’s congressional delegation announced Thursday.The grant will support construction of a new Long Bridge, which is projected to cost nearly $2.3 billion, according to the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority. The federal aid is critical for filling a funding gap that officials had warned could put the project at risk for delays.The existing 117-year-old, double-track span over the Potomac — the main route for trains traveling south from Washington — is at 98 percent capacity during peak traffic times. Plans call for a new two-track span parallel to the current Long Bridge that would separate passenger and freight trains, boost commerce and meet demands for passenger trains along the Interstate 95 corridor.“Long Bridge is the connection between the Northeast and the Southeast, and there’s nothing that can really happen in terms of growing our rail usage both for passenger and freight if you don’t deal with Long Bridge,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said as members of the Virginia’s congressional delegation, along with Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), marked the award Thursday in Arlington.The new funding — through a passenger rail grant program as part of the federal infrastructure law — was announced as part of a series of grants awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation this week for major rail projects, including more than $6 billion for high-speed rail. That includes $3 billion for Brightline’s Las Vegas-to-Southern California route and another $3 billion to California High-Speed Rail Authority for ongoing construction of a 500-mile project connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco.The federal money announced Thursday comes months after Virginia officials warned of delays if funding wasn’t secured this year to close a $729 million budget gap in Virginia’s rail program.The rail authority had applied for $829 million in federal grants through two programs to help pay for construction of the Long Bridge and other projects in Virginia’s $7.2 billion rail program. The new span and other upgrades just south of Washington aim to alleviate a growing East Coast bottleneck of passenger and freight trains at the Potomac River.Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said the project will reduce congestion near L’Enfant Plaza, double Amtrak’s capacity through the corridor and increase capacity for Virginia Railway Express trains. Warner credited the federal infrastructure law with making the funding possible.“This is a great day for Virginia,” he said. “A long time coming.”Thursday’s announcement came one day after Virginia’s rail authority voted to approve a construction contract for the north section of the project. It selected construction engineering firm Skanska and Flatiron to lead the work, planned from the northern banks of the Potomac to just south of the L’Enfant Plaza Virginia Railway Express station in the District. A second contract is expected to be issued next year for the construction of the new span over the river.Officials said the Skanska-Flatiron team will take the project from design — now about 30 percent complete — to construction. Early work will begin next year, while construction is expected to be complete in six years.The contractor selection is a major milestone in keeping the project’s timeline on track for the span to open in 2030.Also Wednesday, the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority approved the selection of a construction team for an almost mile-long bypass just south of the Franconia-Springfield Metro station, which will allow Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express trains to cross over two freight rail tracks to reduce delays. The two-year construction project is expected to begin in the spring.Rail authority Executive Director DJ Stadtler said the selection of construction contractors for the Long Bridge’s northern section and the Franconia-Springfield project is “a significant milestone in our plan to build passenger rail infrastructure at a level not seen in generations.”“We look forward to working with both teams in this important step toward making rail a viable transportation option and truly transforming rail in Virginia,” he said.In addition to the Long Bridge, the new funding will support plans for a third rail along existing track in Northern Virginia, including three miles in Prince William County, two miles in Stafford County and four miles in Spotsylvania County.The Long Bridge plan, conceived more than a decade ago, also calls for the addition of a pedestrian and bike bridge between Long Bridge Park in Arlington and East Potomac Park in the District.CSX owns the Long Bridge, which is mostly in the District, as the new bridge will be. The new span, which will be owned by the state, is critical for Virginia to realize its ambitions to grow commuter and passenger train service, as well as handle projected increases in freight transportation because of growth at the Port of Virginia.The additional capacity connecting the District’s Southwest Waterfront to Crystal City will help Virginia separate passenger and freight trains, which officials say will improve service reliability, and let VRE introduce more service. The commuter rail line already is planning to introduce Saturday trips next year.Youngkin (R) said Thursday the new funding will help rail projects that are opening the corridor between D.C. and Virginia, as well as along the entire East Coast, while also connecting Virginians with commerce. He said it’s part of a multiyear effort to revamp passenger rail in the state.",5680,https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/12/07/virginia-long-bridge-rail/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,funding metro northeast increase kaine ongoing complete line addition interstate critical dj track improve long major bridge close firm service port warn reduce project arlington happen effort aim handle open receive put deal multiyear law peak gap express day decade cost level demand congressional viable amtrak executive gov travel san saturday wednesday usage route department train station begin realize bypass accord coast cross potomac transportation california congestion commerce construction advance current skanska build vre rail significant operation million north growth design bike bank ago exist credit year engineering connect boost span timeline step warner member prince introduce passenger official team alleviate crystal meet double program trip milestone make selection section glenn planning parallel commuter aid brightline forward city flatiron bottleneck expect tim early opening contract plan secure northern announcement work county grant mark option support william railway month pedestrian revamp part park ambition stafford river reliability infrastructure term delegation lead week southeast contractor state approve risk r delay waterfront select transform virginian freight southwest youngkin spotsylvania entire vote conceive pay federal marked grow include director percent virginia connection important enfant angeles budget money corridor announce time thursday issue washington additional authority award apply stadtler east fill mile south capacity separate billion plaza district great call traffic upgrade series,0.98185,0.0,11.836327345309382,0.4144603934077617,0
Washington Post,House censures New York Democrat Jamaal Bowman for pulling fire alarm,2023-12-07 11:05:00,,"The Republican-led House voted Thursday to censure Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) for pulling a fire alarm in September that forced the evacuation of a House office building while lawmakers were laboring to avert a government shutdown.The resolution passed 214-191, in a vote that broke largely along party lines. Bowman became the 27th House member to be censured — and the third this year.The resolution was sponsored by Rep. Lisa C. McClain (R-Mich.), secretary of the House Republican conference, who said Wednesday that Bowman had “knowingly pulled a fire alarm to cause chaos and stop the House from doing business.”“Mr. Bowman should know the consequences of pulling a fire alarm to cause panic,” McClain said, citing Bowman’s time as a middle school principal in the Bronx. “In New York schools, the policy is clear. When a student commits a crime on campus, police are called and that student is either suspended or expelled. One would think Representative Bowman would be able to hold himself to the same standards as he held his students to.”During debate Wednesday, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) called the resolution “profoundly stupid,” trivial and a waste of time.“I find it terribly ironic that we are talking about censuring Mr. Bowman, and yet we never censured any of our colleagues who tried to overturn the election on January 6th,” McGovern said.Asked about Bowman’s expected censure ahead of Thursday’s vote, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said “extreme” Republicans were targeting another Democrat while “burying their heads in the sand with respect to unlawful or unacceptable conduct by their own members.”Bowman, 47, reiterated Wednesday the explanation he had offered in September: that he had been rushing to the Capitol to vote when he tried to exit through a door in the Cannon Office Building that he usually went through.“It didn’t open and, due to confusion and rush to go vote, I pulled the fire alarm,” Bowman said. “I immediately took responsibility and accountability for my actions and pled guilty. The legal process on this matter has played out. In no way did I obstruct official proceedings. The vote took place and Democrats were able to ensure we avoided a government shutdown.”In late October, Bowman pleaded guilty to the charge of pulling a false fire alarm. As part of a deal with the D.C. attorney general’s office, Bowman agreed to pay a $1,000 fine, give $50 to a crime victim’s compensation fund and, within two weeks, apologize in writing to the U.S. Capitol Police chief, according to court documents.In a statement that month, Bowman said, “I am responsible for activating a fire alarm, I will be paying the fine issued, and look forward to these charges being ultimately dropped.”Prosecutors in the D.C. attorney general’s office said the charges could be dropped in late January if Bowman fulfills the terms of the agreement, CNN reported.The House Ethics Committee announced last month that it was declining to investigate Bowman and said no further action by the committee was necessary. Just before he was expelled from Congress, former congressman George Santos (R-N.Y.) introduced a resolution to expel Bowman, citing the fire alarm incident. Democrats downplayed Santos’s motion.“There’s no basis for George Santos, who’s a joke and an embarrassment and a serial fraudster, to move forward with any resolution or to take him seriously at all,” Jeffries said then.The censure vote comes days after one of the top Democrats in Bowman’s district, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, filed paperwork to run against the congressman next year. Bowman is currently serving his second term.The vote also comes as the House has increasingly used the symbolic and once rare punishment against a host of members. A censure is less severe than expulsion from the House but more severe than a reprimand.From 1980 to 2019, there were nine motions focused on censure or supporting censure motions, according to Washington Post columnist Philip Bump. From 2020 to the beginning of November, there have been 35.In June, the House censured Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) for pressing allegations that Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia. In July, Democrats moved to censure Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for hate speech directed at people in the Jewish, Muslim, Asian, immigrant and gay communities. (Last year Democrats sought to censure Greene for posting on social media, “Joe Biden is Hitler.”)",4496,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/jamaal-bowman-censure-fire-alarm/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police allegation fulfills minority november alarm top fraudster respect embarrassment jewish line russia broke pull immigrant fire unacceptable sought collude rare charge stop ahead congressman westchester compensation campus unlawful terribly proceeding offer muslim open matter deal commits labor day responsible philip write cnn executive crime lisa school wednesday file medium avoid colleague biden head begin expel suspend serial move increasingly accord due false late symbolic drop october downplayed hakeem student secretary avert adam conduct george action republican talk congress agree accountability obstruct jeffries former press year immediately activate cannon direct bronx trivial post waste panic member held schiff clear january introduce prosecutor official leader middle victim explanation motion september sponsor responsibility social chaos speech june joke guilty party force stupid chief court punishment knowingly forward july policy expect censure largely rush bump mcclain hate sand confusion county latimer support legal campaign ethic month lawmaker attorney part extreme basis mcgovern debate presidential find reiterate building term incident overturn marjorie week conference plead consequence trump paperwork serve place host decline representative focus york vote process pay profoundly gay fund jamaal general taylor run government give played severe ensure announce time hold thursday capitol joe statement issue washington mr house office asian target standard expulsion columnist agreement donald exit principal ultimately bowman fine greene election evacuation bury ironic santos hitler district resolution apologize community call pass currently investigate democrat committee,-0.98745,0.20017793594306046,9.401212121212119,0.43986503692386036,0
Washington Post,David Mamet is mad at Hollywood. His new book yells why.,2023-12-07 11:00:00,,"There are two kinds of Hollywood movies David Mamet loves best. First are the classics of its golden age: Think Orson Welles, Preston Sturges, noirs and heist films. Second are the David Mamet scripts that Tinsel Town, in his estimation, has been too pigheaded, PC or just plain dumb to produce. In his new essay collection, “Everywhere an Oink Oink,” which he aptly calls “embittered” and “dyspeptic,” the playwright and director sprays insults at the likes of Mike Nichols, Samuel Goldwyn Jr., Dino De Laurentiis, Ridley Scott and Richard Zanuck, the producer who rejected Mamet’s script for Adrian Lyne’s 1997 film “Lolita,” saying of his depiction of the title character, “You made him seem like a pedophile.”That kind of name-dropping and drama-dishing might suggest that Mamet’s book fits in a long tradition of Hollywood gossip tomes, like Julia Phillips’s “You’ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again.” But Mamet truly is an artist in exile now. The self-described “Hermit of Santa Monica,” once celebrated for writing and/or directing films like “Glengarry Glen Ross,” “The Verdict” and “Wag the Dog,” has morphed into a conservative scold in the past decade. “Oink Oink” is meant to be a humorous take on his Hollywood career — it is larded with his cartoons, about which more in a moment. But it’s less funny than cantankerous, bilious and sardonically angry.Some of Mamet’s complaints are reasonable-enough, even witty, jeremiads about Hollywood’s culture of greed and compromise. “Directing a film is like playing chess while wrestling,” he notes, pointing to the bottomless challenges that can hobble a production, including the script, budget, schedule and immoral producers. He recalls a request while directing his 1987 noir, “House of Games,” that he film an unnecessary establishing shot of its Seattle setting. He assembled a toy-boat seascape fit for a middle-school video project, submitted it and heard no more.Mamet has never been an optimist about Hollywood: As far back as “Make-Believe Town” (1996), he was equating summer blockbusters with state-fair spectacles, and his 2007 book on filmmaking, “Bambi vs. Godzilla,” was thick with gibes at producers. But the acid level has risen rapidly since. Consider: In “Bambi,” he called out crew members for auctioning off pants worn on set by his wife, actor Rebecca Pidgeon; in “Oink Oink,” this anecdote now involves a particular producer auctioning Pidgeon’s underwear.Is Mamet hyping and inflating the story for effect? The man who wrote “Glengarry Glen Ross” knows a thing or two about salesmanship. But what he’s selling comes delivered in rhetoric so broad-brush it’s hard to determine the line between truth-telling and hot air. Hollywood is “flogging nonsense,” populated by “criminal dolts” in a “lickspittle racket” policed by “Diversity Capos.” Sometimes the complaint is delivered in the form of tortured metaphors — there’s a longueur on “The Little Engine That Could” and the decline of collective American ambition. Sometimes it arrives in the twitterpated grievance patter of the anti-PC crowd: “We knew [a movie villain] of old by his Black Mustache, or his Black Hat; and today by his white skin.” Often it is laced with very Mamet-ian profanity.Sometimes, alas, it comes in cartoon form. “Oink Oink” features 40-odd one-panel gags. Some are wild-card jokes with terrible premises. (Heard the one about suicide prevention nets on the Golden Gate Bridge?) But most deal with a perceived unjust and unfun culture, and/or a corrupt Hollywood. One, headed “Santa Claus in Hollywood,” says “Better not cry/ Better not shout … You’ll be blacklisted.” A depiction of Disney’s “early attempts at animation” shows a hand lowering a mouse into a film projector. One drawing likens an Oscar statuette to a vibrator. The less said about the ones featuring Cookie Monster, “Shoah” and Harvey Weinstein, the better.This is all meant to play into Mamet’s idea that we — Hollywood, you, me, everyone except, apparently, the Hermit of Santa Monica — have gotten soft. He’s going to revel in his own tastelessness until we come around to his way of thinking: that bowing to conformity in general — and diversity in particular — has ruined film. “The call for equity is a demand for reward without achievement; and the Studios that heed it are, consequently, turning out garbage,” he insists.This could be an assertion to engage with, if “Oink Oink” included any cases of said garbage. For all his strutting, Mamet pulls punches when it comes to specific cases of diversity run amok, the villainous White man and such. The closest he comes to a concrete example is telling: a brief commentary on Joi “SJ” Harris, a Black sport motorcyclist who in 2017 died on the set of “Deadpool 2” when a stunt for which she was hired went awry. Mamet spins a tale of the Screen Actors Guild’s insistence on a Black stuntwoman, despite Harris’s lack of experience, and rejections of more experienced (i.e., White or male) stunt performers. “Who would take the blame for the poor woman’s death?” he writes. “The Diversity Committee? Don’t make me laugh.”Harris’s case is a complex one, and news reports don’t quite adhere to Mamet’s tale of Hollywood’s fatal fealty to diversity. But let’s say Mamet has his facts straight. The tragedy can just as sensibly point to the problem of too few Black stuntwomen in Hollywood — a notion Mamet doesn’t pause to consider.But why would he, when there’s so much chest-beating to get to? “Was I arrogant in my fifty years in showbiz?” he writes. “You bet. But only toward my inferiors.” This preening is lamentable on its face, but also because Mamet’s stock in trade, once upon a time, was rhetorical subtlety. In “Oink Oink,” he explains how he meticulously repaired some plot flaws in Kurosawa’s “High and Low” (a script rejected by Nichols and Scott Rudin) and claims that an unmade thriller titled “Blackbird” is full of “great stuff, many surprises.” I believe him. Track down “The Spanish Prisoner” (1997), a sleeper gem that’s one of the best films starring Steve Martin. Great stuff, many surprises.

Washington Post,Divisions over Gaza roil World Food Program as staff confront Cindy McCain,2023-12-07 10:41:00,,"World Food Program employees confronted the U.N. agency’s director, Cindy McCain, last week, asserting that she was indifferent to the plight of staff at the front lines of the agency’s effort to feed hungry Gazans under siege by Israel, according to a recording of a staff meeting and interviews with four WFP employees.Tensions between McCain and agency staff came to a head in a Nov. 30 call, in which WFP workers in the Middle East and North Africa also criticized her decision to appear at an event where an award in her husband’s name was given to the Israeli people, potentially compromising the agency’s efforts to feed Palestinians in Gaza, staff said.Israel said last month that “no electricity, no food, no fuel” would be allowed to enter the densely populated enclave. Since then, Israel has allowed some aid to enter Gaza — particularly during a week-long pause in fighting — though global health organizations have warned that the amount of aid trickling into Gaza is not commensurate to the need.In the WFP video conference, a recording of which was obtained by The Washington Post, staff asked McCain why the agency, which is tasked with “delivering food assistance in emergencies,” has not said that food is being used as a weapon of war in Gaza, as it has in places like Ethiopia and Yemen. McCain, in the video conference, said she was remaining “neutral,” adding that because the U.N. secretary general has not yet used those terms, WFP would not.Staff also raised concerns about McCain’s apparent absence at a moment of silence held in Rome for the more than 100 U.N. workers killed in Gaza, leading to an awkward interaction in which her deputies scrambled to decide who should lead the gathering. McCain said in the call that she was in attendance, but on the sidelines.A spokesperson for WFP said in a statement that McCain “observed the moment of silence” in front of a memorial wall at the agency’s headquarters, and opened remarks to the executive board the same day “by acknowledging the moment of silence and paying tribute to our team in Gaza.”“The deaths of over 100 of our U.N. colleagues in Gaza is unacceptable,” the spokesperson added, “and we stand in solidarity to mourn all of them who have died in the conflict.”One staffer of WFP’s operations in Gaza told McCain on the call that for “54 days your staff, our teams have been living through hell.” The employee, apparently getting choked up, paused, at which point McCain said, “Do you have a question?”“Where were you, Mrs. Executive Director?” the employee responded. “We have neither your presence nor your action and not even your voice for Gaza.”WFP workers said it is common for executive directors to visit conflict zones where the agency is serving people. McCain noted she had visited Egypt, which has led negotiations for aid to enter the Gaza Strip.“Using the strength and parameters of WFP’s mandate, the Executive Director and her leadership team are working tirelessly to get lifesaving aid to the millions in Gaza in desperate need,” the WFP spokesperson said.Four WFP employees who spoke with The Post on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retribution, said they were disappointed that McCain had not been more forceful in condemning Israel’s siege of Gaza.They have urged her to explicitly call for a humanitarian cease-fire; McCain signed on to a joint statement by the heads of U.N. agencies last month calling for such an action but has not done so individually. The head of another U.N. agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of the World Health Organization, called for a cease-fire a week before the joint statement was issued. The WFP spokesperson said McCain has supported U.N. Secretary General António Guterres’s call for a humanitarian cease-fire “on multiple occasions,” adding that “she has made it clear that, more than anything, what is needed is peace.”McCain, speaking from Phoenix, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” in November that Gaza was possibly ""on the brink of famine,” adding that more aid needed to be let into the enclave. “It is a massive, catastrophic event that is occurring,” she said. WFP said last week that it has provided food to 120,000 Gazans, “but thousands more people need support.”Employees on the call also lamented McCain’s attendance at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, where an award named for McCain’s late husband, Sen. John McCain, was given to “the people of Israel.”McCain interrupted the employee, saying, “I will always support the legacy of my husband. No one will ever take that away from me. So if you disagree with where I went to Halifax, or if you disagree with me supporting my husband, then that’s a disagreement that we’re going to have.”The employee attempted to continue speaking, at which point McCain said, “I didn’t do it. I didn’t do it. I’m done now. I’m done.”McCain’s “condescending, disrespectful” demeanor on the call further angered staff, one employee told The Post.McCain is not a member of the forum and was not involved in the selection process for the award, the WFP spokesperson said. “Ms McCain attended as the widow of her late husband of 40 years and in support of Mr. McCain’s legacy,” the spokesperson said.Still, her appearance at the event, where she also spoke about combating world hunger — her remarks named Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and South Sudan, but not Gaza — was a violation of the humanitarian principle of impartiality, WFP employees told The Post.The staff members said that any perceived impartiality endangers workers on the ground in conflict zones, where militant groups may withhold access to provide aid, threaten or harm employees. The perception that WFP is aligned with Israel would make the work difficult for WFP staff in the Middle East and North Africa, the employees said.McCain took the helm of the agency in April after serving as the U.S. ambassador to U.N. agencies, another posting in Rome. In an April interview on CBS’s “Sunday Morning” program, McCain was asked about having to remain politically neutral in her new role. As U.S. ambassador, McCain had made comments critical of Russia, the program noted. But as a U.N. agency head, McCain is forbidden from taking sides.",6250,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/cindy-mccain-world-food-program-gaza-israel/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,leadership raise enclave enter respond hunger condition november record confront militant continue line perception russia unacceptable urge neutral critical amount weapon side sunday forum headquarters condescend trickle catastrophic agency ghebreyesus tedros warn husband interview halifax brink moment zone angered parameter africa deputy effort mandate open difficult front mourn day told particularly democratic remain multiple executive harm april occasion tribute emergency commensurate colleague global presence silence head deliver helm accord solidarity john event common cindy worker nation video late role apparently gaza board living meeting tasked stand spoke operation secretary ethiopia million assert north possibly sign action observe impartiality choked international retribution forceful wall israeli staffer fight obtain remark year populate rome post acknowledge palestinian away member held condemn attend mccain explicitly spokesperson negotiation clear sudan team middle desperate visit endangers perceive absence program pause morning electricity threaten strength kill appearance make selection aid yemen joint individually interaction awkward concern memorial access somalia gathering fear demeanor antónio work israel principle support month violation question legacy add feed humanitarian egypt comment death group criticize densely gazans term congo ground week lead conference cbs serve place combat decision food staff scramble occur adhanom note decide fuel speak famine tirelessly guterres attendance pay process director republic general disagreement lament point give nova world wfp apparent employee health withhold involve plight disagree disrespectful statement issue washington voice siege award potentially provide forbidden lifesaving east widow thousand phoenix scotia compromise conflict ukraine south align hungry anonymity massive ambassador attempt security interrupt politically call indifferent organization assistance disappointed,-0.99485,0.43199999999999994,8.476704361873988,0.41425299506694846,0
Washington Post,Harry Shearer’s ‘Le Show’ gets immortalized after 40 years on the air,2023-12-07 10:00:00,Thomas Floyd,"As an actor and comic who voices myriad characters on “The Simpsons,” Harry Shearer has owned one of the steadiest gigs in show business since that canonical cartoon’s 1990 premiere. But there’s another post the 79-year-old has held down even longer than the 35 seasons he has portrayed Mr. Burns, Ned Flanders and other Springfieldian denizens.Shearer this week celebrated the 40-year anniversary of “Le Show,” the weekly satirical news broadcast he has brought to the public radio airwaves since December 1983. Reflecting on his decades-long commitment to “Le Show” — amid a career that has also included stints on “Saturday Night Live,” a starring role in the cult classic film “This Is Spinal Tap,” a slew of comedy albums and various onstage endeavors — Shearer described the dynamic of sitting at a mic week after week to deliver his idiosyncratic blend of irreverent news readings, biting political commentary and scripted sketches.“Well, it’s four decades of thinking every week, ‘I’ve got to just stop doing this,’” Shearer deadpanned during a recent phone interview from his home in New Orleans. “Which clearly was ineffective.”Although Shearer said he hasn’t spent much time pondering “Le Show’s” longevity over the years, this week’s anniversary isn’t the only occasion for such retrospection. On Thursday morning, the American Archive of Public Broadcasting — a collaboration between the Library of Congress and Boston public media producer GBH — announced the launch of Le Show Collection, a publicly accessible digital archive of more than 2,000 hours of broadcasts.“There’s no time to think about [an episode] after doing it because the next one is coming right up,” Shearer said. “The radio comes and disappears into the ether almost immediately. To have that situation totally reversed and having it be available over time is remarkable.”Shearer’s program was originally titled “The Voice of America” and “The Hour of Power” before switching in 1985 to “Le Show,” playing on a corporate trend at the time to Frenchify brands. Originally broadcast via KCRW in Santa Monica, Calif., “Le Show” has been hosted by WWNO in New Orleans since 2014 while appearing on public radio stations across the globe.Rosa A. Eberly, an associate professor of rhetoric at Penn State, was the driving force behind the effort to archive “Le Show.” A student at the University of Chicago in the mid-1980s when she discovered “Le Show,” Eberly spent years religiously listening to the program — eventually working it into her curriculum as a teacher — before she started a correspondence with Shearer about a decade ago. The academic was already interested in digitizing the show’s archive when she visited Shearer’s Santa Monica residence and saw that the only comprehensive collection of “Le Show” episodes existed as cassette tapes, digital audiotapes and CDs in his basement — precariously close, she quickly realized, to the Pacific Ocean.“One of the things I study is ancient rhetoric, so I’m pretty well familiar with what texts survive and how they survive and what gets lost,” Eberly said. “And I just really didn’t want this to get lost.”So Eberly sparked the movement to archive “Le Show” and curated the accompanying exhibit Harry Shearer’s Le Show: Sonic Portal to News, Satire, Memory, History, an online overview that includes four Shearer-penned essays. The collection itself — a searchable online database now available to the public — provides access to decades of full episodes and highlighted segments.The sketches, written and voiced entirely by Shearer, include spoofs of each administration he covered — starting with the Reagan-centric “Hellcats of the White House” before moving on to “Clintonsomething,” “Dick Cheney: Confidential,” “Father Knows Best” and the Trump era satire “The Appresidentice.” The archive also spotlights Shearer’s penchant for dry wit and wordplay as he rolls through headlines in such recurring segments as “News From Outside the Bubble,” “Reading the Trades” and “Apologies of the Week.”“Obviously there’s amazing satire there,” Eberly said. “But what really captivated me about listening to ‘Le Show’ is Harry’s extemporaneous rhetorical flourishes. It’s the very stark contrast between the seriousness of a lot of what he informs us about and the folly in his delivery.”While Shearer emphasized that he isn’t one to listen to old episodes, he recalled how the tone of the show changed in the early 2000s, when he felt many media outlets fueled misperceptions around Hurricane Katrina and the buildup to the Iraq War. Shearer subsequently laced “Le Show” with more commentary on the media, and the program’s balance between news and comedy skewed toward the former.“I thought, ‘Well, I have a microphone. I have an audience. I can share this stuff with them and feel better about the situation,’” Shearer said. “So the show evolved into much more information alongside the entertainment.”As Shearer enters his 80s later this month, continues to lend his many voices to “The Simpsons” and prepares to shoot a “Spinal Tap” sequel next year, he shows no desire to exit “Le Show” — a program, he pointed out, for which he has never been paid. So what keeps him going?",5211,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2023/12/07/harry-shearer-le-show-archive/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,seriousness lot spotlight available chicago change share gbh academic misperceptions continue public cover simpson precariously celebrate portal american stop commentary drive wit retrospection lose highlight close described microphone power audience teacher irreverent tap interview accessible entirely subsequently full prepares canonical effort script cassette cd folly start amid write amaze decade study library springfieldian gig evolve america confidential monica sonic recur saturday dick occasion medium digital trend endeavor film spinal orleans emphasize pretty station realize interested deliver move audiotape ponder comic information live career pacific dry apology originally extemporaneous steadiest listen role political history anniversary reverse corporate student home university clintonsomething weekly congress commitment play spoof basement curated satirical ago flourish wwno exhibit mic segment exist totally airwave year immediately satire shoot kcrw comprehensive skewed spent lace sketch post cheney portrayed burn rhetoric held album digitize december headline felt collaboration comedy reflect visit quickly informs collection shearer associate character program outlet morning accompany wordplay deadpanned captivate force switch hellcat launch reading slew frenchify brand santa administration desire lend professor boston early disappears onstage paid access idiosyncratic online recent katrina broadcast classic text hour situation longevity work eberly rhetorical producer tape movement radio month roll publicly phone biting title ancient season week stark state trump trade host ether feel iraq cult archive penn stint fuel sequel residence include blend overview alongside flanders enters episode survive contrast point night voiced father searchable premiere longer balance recall announce time thursday familiar brought religiously house voice star news hurricane spark memory provide show correspondence bubble harry database exit cartoon tone dynamic stuff discover essay eventually white business buildup penchant myriad actor broadcasting curriculum,0.9755499999999999,0.05757052389176741,8.646129970902038,0.3643288997636824,0
Washington Post,White House targets drug patents in latest effort to lower prices,2023-12-07 09:15:00,,"The White House on Thursday announced its latest gambit to lower U.S. drug prices: a plan to step in and license patent rights to other manufacturers when certain drugs’ prices are too high.Under the proposed framework, which relies on the White House’s new legal interpretation of a 43-year-old federal law, the high price of a taxpayer-funded drug will be a factor in determining when to invoke a regulatory power known as “march-in rights,” senior officials said.“The agency that funded the research can then license the invention to a competitor that is able and willing to make it available on reasonable terms,” Neera Tanden, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, told reporters Wednesday. “Fundamentally, we are establishing that price can now be a factor in determining … when the federal government can march-in to ensure that we have lower prices.”President Biden also released a short video where he said the administration was working “toward ending price-gouging, so you don’t have to pay more for medicines than you need.”The authority to license a drug’s patent rights to another manufacturer has never been invoked for drugs, and White House officials said they had not yet targeted any high-price pharmaceuticals. Officials characterized the move as part of Biden’s ongoing efforts to lower the price of drugs, which includes provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that allow the federal government to directly negotiate the prices of popular drugs used by patients covered through the federal government’s Medicare program for older Americans.Thursday’s announcement comes after the Biden administration conducted a nearly year-long review of its legal authorities under the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which laid out rules on who owns the intellectual property from federally funded research. Advocates and some lawmakers, including Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have argued that the law’s provisions permit federal agencies to use march-in authority on numerous high-priced drugs the agencies helped develop.The National Institutes of Health this year rejected an appeal to use march-in rights on a high-priced prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, which costs more than $160,000 for one year of treatment in the United States but is sold for a fraction of that price in other countries. The NIH’s decision on Xtandi sparked a fight with Sanders, the chair of the Senate’s health committee, who delayed the confirmation hearing for a new NIH director this year until the White House privately pledged to him that it would pursue new drug-pricing measures.The administration will seek comments on its proposed framework for when to invoke march-in rights. The framework was issued by the Department of Commerce and published in the Federal Register on Thursday morning. Advocates said they were waiting on the final framework, which is expected to be completed next year, to determine how effective the policy would be.Invoking march-in rights could be “a check on profiteering,” depending on how aggressively the Biden administration chooses to use the authority, said Peter Maybarduk, who directs the access-to-medicines group at the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen and supports using march-in rights. “Drugmakers should be on notice that unreasonable pricing could cost them their monopoly.”Biden has increasingly campaigned on his efforts to tackle high drug prices, with the White House citing polls that most American adults support the president’s policies. About 8 in 10 Democrats and nearly 7 in 10 Republicans have said there has not been enough government action to lower the price of drugs, according to polling conducted in July by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy group.Experts on Wednesday said they expected the Biden administration’s new interpretation of the Bayh-Dole Act would face legal challenges from drugmakers, who have fiercely opposed efforts to invoke march-in rights for high-priced drugs. The pharmaceutical industry is already battling the Biden administration’s plan to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs in the Medicare program.“This would be yet another loss for American patients who rely on public-private sector collaboration to advance new treatments and cures,” Megan Van Etten, spokeswoman for PhRMA, the drug industry’s flagship trade association, said in a statement. “The Administration is sending us back to a time when government research sat on a shelf, not benefiting anyone.”Some former government officials and experts have also warned against invoking march-in rights for pharmaceuticals, saying that weakening the power of patents would undermine private-sector incentives for innovation.Invoking march-in rights to lower the price of a drug such as Xtandi is “a disastrous idea that could effectively destroy the legal foundation for the public-private research partnerships that bring new products to American consumers,” Walter Copan, who served as director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology during the Trump administration, wrote in a Denver Post op-ed last year.",5117,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/12/07/drug-prices-patent-white-house/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country available send depend treatment short profiteer ongoing complete back shelf manufacturer public cover elizabeth patient partnership american expert invention pursue agency warn power prostate appeal megan senior argue reduction rule effort tanden gambit drugmakers cancer patent law rely review property write told cost delayed release pricing prescription wait senate polling poll denver wednesday department biden reporter fundamentally move framework increasingly accord directs establish bernie late video price commerce flagship technology medicine tackle advance characterize conduct action republican idea advocate privately maybarduk neera national fight weaken former register bring year publish disastrous sander step provision loss post sat medicare act advocacy collaboration pledge official etten warren program fiercely morning battling inflation copan negotiate nonpartisan foundation make factor competitor july policy sell administration expect kff popular laid plan adult united industry effective announcement chooses work license support legal regulatory campaign nih destroy president determine directly chair lawmaker part comment group unreasonable research term spokeswoman cure check state benefiting trump trade serve permit seek low citizen decision challenge high invoked walter aggressively sector consumer pay federal include director fund council government pharmaceutical association phrma ensure effectively health notice announce xtandi fraction time thursday statement issue house interpretation domestic final authority target spark intellectual standard federally reasonable propose undermine oppose numerous confirmation hearing invoke white incentive product institute reject organization relies democrat committee,-0.86625,0.0586281024037522,12.703718820861678,0.34723871366728504,0
Washington Post,Ask Sahaj: White boyfriend doesn’t get girlfriend’s need to follow rules,2023-12-07 09:00:00,Sahaj Kaur Kohli,"Hi Sahaj: I am 44 and Black/White mixed; my boyfriend is White. My parents experienced a lot of racism and joined the military. They moved my siblings and I across the U.S. to hopefully raise us away from it. Growing up, we were held to high standards for behavior, and it was ingrained in us to always follow the rules as best we could. The effect of this is that I continue to follow rules and am quite nervous when they are broken.Since my boyfriend did not grow up like this, and also has the privilege of being White, he is often frustrated with my behavior. For example, we went to a sports game, and he wanted to examine a section of seating that was roped off. I was nervous to do so but he couldn’t understand my hesitation. I’ve explained how I grew up, and why I act the way I do, but this keeps happening.I think in general I am pretty fun-loving, open to adventure and open-minded, but the need to be safe and remove myself from potential conflicts is pervasive. I see a therapist regularly, but he is not open to counseling.— Hesitant GirlfriendHesitant Girlfriend: This specific example of not wanting to examine the closed seating section at a sports game sounds like one piece of a larger issue. Your boyfriend doesn’t seem to recognize how you may be perceived by the world differently — and thus experience the world differently — than him because of your race.Reflect on how often — and when — you and your boyfriend have this kind of argument. Do they all tend to be related to public safety? Or are there times you feel like your boyfriend gets frustrated because your preferences are simply different? Are there repetitive feelings that arise every time? Does he often invalidate your emotions? Do you tend to shut down in response to his frustration? Identify patterns and roadblocks; these reflections can shed light on how these situations impact your sense of safety and understanding in the relationship with your boyfriend.Would something have happened if you got caught looking at the closed seating area together? Probably not. Would you have been treated differently if you were caught without your boyfriend? Maybe. There’s no way to know, but you have certainly been taught to consider this. You’ve internalized the narratives your parents learned — and passed down — from the racism and subsequent fear they experienced. Don’t rock the boat. Follow the rules. Behave. It’s not merely about being “open-minded” or “adventurous”; it’s also about protecting your safety.It’s impossible to separate yourself from your racial identity, and only you can really understand how this impacts you. It’s important for you to reflect on this because self-awareness can offer more insight into what you want to share with your boyfriend. I can’t help but wonder if this is the first interracial relationship for either of you, or if generally talking about race is uncomfortable for him. In all interracial relationships, having deeper conversations about race and identity is key. This shouldn't be just in reaction to situations like at the sports game but rather embedded throughout your relationship to create a safe space where you can both exist fully in your identities.Be honest with yourself about your boyfriend’s interest in understanding you, or even whether he has an issue talking about race that needs to be addressed for you to feel comfortable in your relationship. Your boyfriend may feel frustrated that something seemingly small to him is up for debate, but his frustration should not supersede your fear. Instead, you both need to be able to talk about these things in the same way you may talk about the fact that one of you repeatedly forgets to close the kitchen cabinet all the way after opening it. It may seem small at first, but small problems often lead to big relationship issues.Given that you feel your need to avoid potential conflict is “pervasive,” I want to note that generally, when someone isn’t spontaneous, or fears bending the rules, there is often a baseline of stress, worry or anxiety at play. Think about how these feelings actually impact you — and to what degree. For instance, do you lose sleep, or struggle breathing, or have negative thought spirals that are hard to manage? These can indicate effects on your day-to-day functioning that should be addressed through continued professional support.",4369,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2023/12/07/ask-sahaj-white-boyfriend-rules-girlfriend/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,raise behavior lot boat response share frustrate hesitant feeling manage continue argument conversation sound public baseline seat worry girlfriendhesitant kind relationship supersede arise continued lose close large caught shed regularly girlfriend professional happen function rule pattern address preference offer uncomfortable open effect struggle frustration roadblock key negative privilege learn game wonder kitchen experienced avoid pretty repeatedly explain narrative consider move embed probably military potential small experience racism internalize sleep talk play simply light safety exist hard understand spontaneous adventurous away follow related held act comfortable racial sport sibling interest reflect rock perceive fully subsequent nervous adventure section shut breathing forgets opening instead therapist degree safe fear situation honest ingrain support boyfriend hesitation emotion different stress debate mixed lead fact remove join identify high feel big parent anxiety note generally piece deeper protect grow invalidate examine specific space general important taught pervasive impact recognize reaction world repetitive impossible reflection indicate behave time race issue identity tend differently seemingly insight instance standard problem create sahaj treat conflict white separate interracial roped spiral cabinet pass bending area,-0.63405,0.20599679560540168,8.376666666666662,0.4862666092077854,0
Washington Post,Israeli forces battle Hamas as disease spreads among the displaced,2023-12-07 08:39:00,,"AMMAN, Jordan — Israeli forces fought Hamas militants in street battles across Gaza on Thursday, claiming they were closing in on the hideouts of key commanders, as the United Nations appealed for an urgent end to the war to avert an imminent “humanitarian catastrophe.”In a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, President Biden “stressed that much more assistance was urgently required across the board,” the White House said in a summary of the call. Biden also emphasized the importance of humanitarian corridors that would allow civilians to flee “areas of hostilities.”Biden appeared to blame Hamas for the collapse of a seven-day pause in the fighting last month, saying “it was Hamas’s refusal to release young women civilian hostages that led to a breakdown in the humanitarian pause.”Some of the heaviest fighting Thursday was in the southern city of Khan Younis, which Israel once advised Gazans was a safe area but which is now a major focus of the battle. A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister’s office, Eylon Levy, said the Israel Defense Forces were in “close-quarter combat against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip including Khan Younis, eliminating tunnel shafts and the terrorists operating within them.”Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, was a major destination for Palestinians fleeing the north before it became the new center of fighting. According to the United Nations, a quarter of the city’s area has been declared an evacuation zone by the Israeli military in recent days. An estimated 358,000 people, nearly half of them refugees from elsewhere in Gaza, have received evacuation orders, the office for humanitarian affairs said on Wednesday.The IDF and militants fought pitched battles in the Jabalya refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip, where local authorities said an estimated 100,000 people were at risk of starvation after two months of war. In the Jabalya and Shejaiya areas, Levy said, Israeli forces had “broken through their defensive lines and those terrorists are now emerging from their underground tunnels to engage our men in close combat.”There were reports of mass arrests of Gazan men by Israeli troops. Photographs and video footage posted by Israeli news sites and circulated on social media showed hundreds of men in their underwear, blindfolded with their hands behind their heads, seated in rows on the ground and guarded by Israeli troops. It was unclear whether the men were fighters and whether they had surrendered or were rounded up. The Israeli military did not respond to a request to confirm the images.Airstrikes continued across the Gaza Strip, including two in the southern border town of Rafah, a vital transshipment point for the faltering international aid effort, where tens of thousands of people have sought refuge in recent days.The al-Houbi family home in the Shaboura area was hit at night, and Najjar Hospital reported receiving at least 20 dead. A second house was hit in the morning, but it had been evacuated and no casualties were reported. A motorcycle carrying four men was hit near the Rafah crossing into Egypt.The Gaza Health Ministry said 350 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours, bringing to 17,177 the number who have died in Gaza during the two-month war.U.N. Secretary General António Guterres warned Wednesday evening that Gaza’s entire humanitarian system is on the brink of collapse, putting 2.1 million people at risk of death from hunger and epidemic disease.“We are simply unable to reach those in need inside Gaza,” he said, and he appealed to the international community to take “urgent” steps to stop the fighting.He invoked for the first time in his six-year tenure Article 99 of the U.N. Charter, which will force the Security Council to meet to discuss a course of action.Guterres’s appeal for an immediate cease-fire was echoed Thursday by humanitarian aid agencies, a group of which told an online briefing that disease, hunger and unsanitary conditions could soon kill as many people as the violence.“The situation in Gaza is not just a catastrophe. It’s apocalyptic,” said Bushra Khalidi, the Jerusalem-based Palestinian policy lead for Oxfam. Alexandra Saieh, the head of humanitarian policy and advocacy at Save the Children, described hospitals where amputations were being performed without anesthesia and maggots were being picked from the wounds of the injured. “We are literally running out of words to describe the horrors taking place in Gaza,” Saieh said.Conditions have deteriorated rapidly for Gaza’s residents, over 85 percent of whom have been displaced from their homes and are sleeping in many cases out in the open and without access to adequate food, clean water or shelter from the winter cold.Doctors have warned about the risk of disease spreading in overcrowded shelters and refugee camps in Gaza’s south.“Through our inspection of refugee camps, we noticed a large spread of hepatitis, which is spreading due to crowding of people, lack of usable drinking water and contaminated food,” Imad Al-Hams, an emergency physician in Rafah, told The Washington Post. “This is a serious disease that leads to death.”He said it was hard to issue official figures on the volume of infections, because of the large number of people and a lack of access for medical teams, but noted that many diseases were spreading because of poor hygiene conditions, and children were particularly at risk.Saif Al-Din Muhammad Qadouha, 45, told The Post that his home in northern Gaza was destroyed at the outset of the war, driving him to Rafah, where he and his family now live in a makeshift school shelter. “We receive water only once, for an hour, every three or four days. … I live with my family of 11 people in this tent,” he said.Israeli soldiers rounded up dozens of Palestinian men, stripped them down to their underwear and tied their hands tied behind their backs, according to a video apparently filmed in the Beit Lahia area of northern Gaza.The IDF has not commented on the footage, but IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said at a news conference Thursday that Israeli troops in Gaza have “arrested and interrogated hundreds of suspects of terrorist activity.” He said many had turned themselves in over the previous day. Hagari said the IDF detains and interrogates anyone in areas of military activity.Hani Almadhoun, a Palestinian man who lives in Washington, D.C., identified his brother, 32-year-old Mahmoud Almadhoun, and other relatives in the video clip. Almadhoun, the director of philanthropy in D.C. for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said his relatives in the video are civilians who are not associated with Hamas or any other fighters. Israeli media outlets have been reporting that the videos show members of Hamas, without citing any sources.“This is just to humiliate,” Almadhoun said. “In what planet is this okay? Why is this okay? Why are they rounding people from their homes?”Photographer Abdul Hakim Abu Rayash, a resident of Beit Lahia, confirmed to The Post that the detained included a Diaa Al-Kahlot, the Gaza bureau chief of Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed newspaper.Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general, called the images on social media “very concerning.”U.S. drones have resumed flying over Gaza, the Pentagon said Thursday. Spokeswoman Lisa Lawrence said the drones were used previously on intelligence-gathering and surveillance missions, first disclosed in early November, in support of Israel’s hostage-recovery efforts. They were suspended late last month as part of the agreement between Israel and Hamas for the pause in hostilities, officials said at the time.",7695,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/israel-hamas-khan-younis-battle-disease/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25EHFRI7Q3GFKZAGTGGJXUAGL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,contaminate khan dozen respond fly hunger broken condition wound november quarter bushra back relative refuge militant importance line describe seat request mass netanyahu sought motorcycle discus advise stop drive major refugee half drinking troop continued hostility close tunnel large imad described agency warn appeal mahmoud guard brink zone emerge deteriorate tenure hostage humiliate arrest tent disease effort fighter poor bureau system brother open receive put day eylon muhammad told particularly course key unable release child interrogates displace qadouha suspect school rayash reach lisa wednesday medium emergency shaft film emphasize pentagon biden head carry clean suspend destination oxfam hagari imminent local accord prime due cross casualty live alexandra military nation video late apparently najjar gaza southern crowd blindfold estimate board injured planet avert secretary dujarric home million figure spokesman north circulate underground sleep urgently outset spread young levy international site round simply saieh israeli confirm border center hakim drone turn require catastrophe fight life interrogate bring closing affair hard lack resident claim declare step post dead palestinian anesthesia breakdown hygiene member shaboura report spokesperson water advocacy flee picked official row team inside jabalya shelter khalidi makeshift social meet associate idf charter diaa case outlet defense amputation pause photographer defensive resume morning number kill fought operating overcrowd town force summary camp chief hand aid ten heaviest hamas city policy maggot early philanthropy perform falter tie medical access refusal online united recent family safe hour eliminate situation winter northern antónio terrorist inspection israel disclose detains support previous destroyed almadhoun usable president pitch article month younis hundred humanitarian physician minister part gazan comment stress death group benjamin lahia gazans underwear spokeswoman ground lead conference reporting strip hideout risk surveillance place street image combat identify shejaiya food save abu clip invoked apocalyptic note entire word focus abdul guterres soldier photograph include beit starvation hospital percent director transshipment rapidly general jordan run engage council point vital previously unrwa night blame footage woman horror lawrence health corridor notice order time thursday detain collapse echoed evacuate issue washington hit mission volume house urgent office ministry rafah authority news show agreement unclear commander hepatitis daniel immediate amman thousand evacuation adequate unsanitary battle white surrender epidemic literally infection security community briefing call area civilian assistance,-0.99745,0.3898635477582845,10.64779516358464,0.3607719055635723,0
Washington Post,Pantone announces its 2024 color of the year,2023-12-07 08:30:00,,"The world’s color authority has declared that we need to be comforted. And there’s only one hue that’ll provide a sufficient level of coziness and warmth.Enter Peach Fuzz, Pantone’s 2024 color of the year.Soothing our fractured world sure sounds like a tall order for a muted mix of pink and orange. But in a news release, Pantone’s executive director, Leatrice Eiseman, asserted: “Peach Fuzz brings belonging, inspires recalibration, and an opportunity for nurturing. Drawing comfort from PANTONE 13-1023 Peach Fuzz, we can find peace from within, impacting our wellbeing.”The year 2024 marks the 25th anniversary of the Pantone Color Institute decreeing a color of the year. The special occasion might explain the company’s relative return to basics with a hue as classic as peach. By comparison, it introduced last year’s Viva Magenta alongside immersive AI-generated images, and for 2021, the company kind of cheated and selected two colors. Nonetheless, this year’s rollout still comes with ample branded merchandise showcasing Peach Fuzz — including carpets, cellphones and makeup.In recent years, Pantone has emphasized the ways in which its chosen color inspires courage and vitality, but Peach Fuzz seems to bring a different energy to the table.“The color is one whose warm and welcoming embrace conveys a message of compassion and whose cozy sensibility brings people together and enriches the soul,” Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, said in the same news release announcing the shade.While Viva Magenta seemed an on-the-nose pick for 2023, the year of Barbiecore, there isn’t as obvious of a cultural tie-in for Peach Fuzz in 2024 (though perhaps the earworm power ballad “Peaches” from “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” got people thinking). Trendiness, however, might be beneath good ol’ peach. Something of a double threat, the warm neutral can both stand on its own and pair well with an array of bolder colors.",1954,https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2023/12/07/pantone-2024-color-of-the-year-peach-fuzz/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,chosen vice merchandise viva double pantone return relative vitality fracture sound decree threat neutral enriches courage kind soul special movie basic brand beneath nurture draw mix opportunity comfort warm power cheat recent earworm classic coziness mark immersive array obvious eiseman ample company recalibration president color pressman different fuzz message find super level release ballad sensibility executive peach trendiness occasion bolder select image cultural emphasize explain comparison nonetheless include energy director brings laurie alongside welcome belonging cozy tall compassion impact leatrice anniversary world cellphone stand mario assert announce order pink mute rollout authority ol news peace magenta provide barbiecore pair embrace pick inspires bring year carpet declare orange institute showcasing conveys introduce sufficient,0.9924,0.0,9.433458445040213,0.484265873015873,0
Washington Post,‘Oppenheimer’ to show in Japan in 2024 after months of controversy,2023-12-07 08:21:00,,"“Oppenheimer,” the biopic about the scientist at the center of the U.S. effort to develop the atomic bomb, will be released in Japan next year, after months of controversy and pushback in the country.Many critics said the film, which was released in the United States and other countries in July, underplayed the devastating impact of the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945, which killed as many as 210,000 people by some estimates.“Oppenheimer” was a hit in box offices worldwide, and in Asian markets, including South Korea and China. But a release date in Japan was never confirmed, sparking speculation that it might never be shown in the country.Bitters End, the movie’s distributor in Japan, said in a statement that the movie’s subject “is of great importance and holds special meaning for Japanese people,” according to Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun. The company said it decided to release the movie in the country in 2024 after “various discussions and considerations,” though it did not provide an exact release date.“Christopher Nolan’s impressive direction and traditional cinematic techniques made the film a unique viewing experience, and we believe everyone should share that experience on a big screen,” Bitters End said in the statement. Bitters End did not immediately respond to a request for further comment Thursday.Nolan previously told Variety that he decided not to show the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the movie because “the film presents Oppenheimer’s experience subjectively” and that he wanted to “rigidly stick to that.” Nolan told the magazine that “Oppenheimer heard about the bombing at the same time that the rest of the world did” and that he “wanted to show somebody who is starting to gain a clearer picture of the unintended consequences of his actions.”Critics, which included anti-nuclear groups, said “Oppenheimer” failed to give a voice to the Japanese people who suffered from the atomic bombings, as well as residents of New Mexico who lived near the bomb’s test site and who continue to suffer the health consequences of presumed radiation exposure decades later.“Oppenheimer” was released on the same day as Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie”; many referred to the joint release of the contrasting movies as “Barbenheimer.” Amid the buzz around both films, Warner Bros., which produced “Barbie,” was called out by its Japanese office after it interacted with social media posts overlaying Barbie with nuclear imagery from “Oppenheimer.”",2501,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/oppenheimer-japan-release/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country japanese barbie heard underplayed worldwide speculation clearer respond refer social japan share importance continue kill request christopher imagery make develop special mexico buzz discussion fail july movie atomic joint impressive newspaper direction asahi united korea view believe rigidly effort china consideration unique exposure biopic company overlay month date start interact comment day group traditional amid told decade release critic greta state consequence gerwig nolan medium film present big presume technique devastate destruction decide pushback accord live include controversy radiation screen experience stick scientist contrast impact bombing previously give bomb produce world suffer bitter health variety box hold time oppenheimer subject statement hit market site office asian voice test spark confirm provide center show shimbun meaning hiroshima picture year immediately exact resident nuclear subjectively distributor post magazine south warner nagasaki great call cinematic rest unintended,-0.44785,0.3598560575769692,10.544721030042918,0.33841335432244524,0
Washington Post,New research undercuts Republican views of racism,2023-12-07 07:00:00,,"The emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement almost a decade ago was predicated on the killing of Black people at the hands of law enforcement. In short order, though, that concern spurred a broader consideration of the ways in which racial discrimination or disadvantage is embedded in the systems that undergird American society, including law enforcement.There were obvious effects. One was that people became much more likely to point to discrimination as the central cause of economic differences between White and Black Americans. Another is that this shift occurred only among Democrats and independents; among Republicans, there was no change. Instead, the rhetoric from Republican leaders rejected the idea that there existed systemic racism in the country. Suggesting that it did was cast as unpatriotic and ahistoric.Black Lives Matter gained prominence at a moment when White Americans, particularly on the right, were already nervous about their social status. Demographers were projecting that Whites would no longer be a majority within a few decades, and older generations of Americans who are more heavily White saw younger, more heavily non-White generations emerging that espoused different political views generally. Donald Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, near the outset of the BLM movement, and his supporters were more likely than other Americans to say that they believed White Americans were the targets of discrimination.That pattern has continued. In July, Yahoo News commissioned polling from YouGov looking at the extent to which different racial groups were seen as targets of racism. About three-quarters of Americans said that racism was at least a small problem for Black people. Fewer than half said the same of White Americans.White Americans, meanwhile, were more likely to say that racism was at least a small problem for them. But among Republicans? A third said that racism against White people was a big problem and 7 in 10 said it was at least a small problem — a higher level than Republicans felt was the case for any of the other racial groups included in the poll.Last November, YouGov asked similar questions on behalf of the Economist. Then, they found that about a third of respondents believed that White Americans face at least a fair amount of discrimination, compared with two-thirds who said the same of Black Americans. Republicans, though, were more likely to say that Whites faced at least a fair amount of discrimination than they were to say the same of Black Americans.This probably seems to most observers like a rather obviously dubious position, one rooted in a demonstrative response to the emergence of a national conversation about race rather than actual racism or discrimination that White people have experienced. New research from KFF reinforces that skepticism.KFF’s pollsters asked a range of Americans of diverse racial backgrounds how often they experienced discrimination or occurrences that they believed were a function of their race. The result?“At least half of [American Indian and Alaska Native], Black, and Hispanic adults and about four in ten Asian adults say they have experienced at least one type of discrimination in daily life at least a few times in the past year,” the researchers reveal, “and they are more likely to say these experiences were due to their race or ethnicity compared to their White counterparts.”Across a series of questions, Whites were less likely than other members of racial groups to say that they experienced negative responses from other people, ranging from disparagement to poor service to overt threats.Black Americans were also almost three times as likely as Whites to say that they or members of their family had been mistreated by police in the previous year. They were also more likely to say that they had experienced being paid less than others doing the same job and less likely to say that they felt safe in their neighborhoods.Importantly, 4 in 10 Black Americans — as well as 3 in 10 Hispanic and Asian Americans — said that the responses they experienced were at least in part a function of race. Among Whites, only 6 percent believed that race was the reason for the negative responses.KFF also overlaid a fascinating additional consideration: skin tone. It wasn’t simply the case that Black Americans were more likely than White Americans to say that they had negative experiences that were a function of discrimination. There was also a gap between Black people with light or dark skin tones.“[A]mong Black adults,” the researchers report, “those with self-reported darker skin tones are more likely to report discrimination experiences than those with lighter skin tones.”This strongly suggests that what’s being measured isn’t simply an unjustified perception of racism but, instead, actually discriminatory responses being experienced by people of color. In other words, it can’t simply be dismissed as somehow reflecting an oversensitivity to bias. Instead, it’s a reflection of actual bias and discrimination.Then we can go a step further: It is likely that Republican perceptions of White Americans as facing more discrimination than Black Americans are themselves a reflection of oversensitivity, of viewing the question through a lens of partisan perception rather than actual experience.",5340,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/07/kff-racial-descrimination-polling/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country indian police reinforces respondent reason response november change short overlaid undergird conversation perception suggests amount american suggest darker half continued independent espouse ethnicity economic service overt type bias similar blm moment project emerge compare spur function unpatriotic view enforcement pattern mong democrat poor system color effect predicate partisan matter law gap decade particularly level negative polling extent demonstrative prominence root cast experienced economist dark discriminatory heavily due diverse embed probably past political small experience racism broader reveal measure commission society fascinate republican idea background outset young simply ago light national oversensitivity exist behalf life year supporter step rhetoric member discrimination occurrence result report racial found felt difference leader reflect central social demographer unjustified case strongly majority kill range nervous fair hand ten pollster july kff concern instead paid adult mistreat family safe believe consideration obvious previous movement actual job question different part group candidacy observer black research alaska disparagement trump yahoo shift lens native high occur big generally word position researcher include systemic percent lighter point reflection longer skin announce order time race additional asian generation news target disadvantage problem donald tone daily status white dubious hispanic reject dismiss yougov emergence series,-0.96275,0.16853932584269662,11.681109925293487,0.4188683207339921,0
Washington Post,How an unfiltered tween became a social media sensation,2023-12-07 06:00:00,Taylor Lorenz,"Every morning before school, Evelyn, a seventh-grader in suburban Kansas City, props her iPhone up against the mirror of her vanity, applies a series of makeup and skin care products, and vents to the camera.“Things that are embarrassing,” she said in one video that amassed over 11.1 million views. “When someone who’s really rude asks why they have no friends. Maybe you have no friends because you’re a b---- to everyone,” she continues. She goes on to lambaste people who use an outdated phrase or act differently when boys are around or when they’re being filmed.Videos outlining things she hates, or things that make her mad, or things that disgust her, have made Evelyn an overnight sensation on the internet. (She spoke on the condition that The Washington Post use only her first name given her age.) She has amassed more than 17 million views on Instagram Reels and hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. After she began posting to TikTok regularly in September, she gained nearly 500,000 followers there in less than three months.Cutting, sarcastic and opinionated, Evelyn never names names, and much of her commentary is about standing up to bullies, not encouraging bullying. And she does it all while expertly applying a slew of makeup and skin care items, subtly integrating the products into her videos. She’ll hold up the bottles with the label facing toward the camera but almost never acknowledges them or calls brands out by name. This makes her content feel more organic, according to digital marketing experts who work with content creators.But beyond her success as a marketing phenomenon, Evelyn’s rise raises questions about the current push among state and federal lawmakers to impose age limits on social media. Evelyn is just a few months shy of 13, the age at which most platforms allow children to operate their own accounts, and a large percentage of her audience is made up of children from her age group.Adding to the questions is Evelyn’s role in a growing market the beauty industry is targeting: tween girls. Eight- to 12-year-old girls are the largest growth market for the cosmetics industry, with tweens spending $40 million a month on beauty products, according to Pinkstinks, a nonprofit aimed at fighting gender bias in the beauty industry. And at least 80 percent of U.S. tweens use beauty products, a 2016 report by the trend-forecasting group Mintel found.Marketers acknowledge that Evelyn represents a shift in the type of content that resonates online, offering a peek at the sorts of creators who appeal to Gen Alpha, the generation younger than Gen Z: Evelyn is outgoing and funny, her videos have strong hooks, a repeatable format and appear unfiltered. She’s not doing any growth hacks like camera shakes in the beginning or trying to trick viewers into watching.Evelyn appears to follow all the rules — her mother is actually the account holder because Evelyn isn’t old enough to manage an account. Her manager said Evelyn’s mother reviews and edits her content and is present when it’s filmed. (Her hands are often featured in Evelyn’s videos.) She brainstorms video ideas with Evelyn and oversees her comment section and direct messages.Evelyn’s parents even have set up a Coogan Account, which will hold any earnings from social media in trust until Evelyn turns 18. The name comes from Jackie Coogan, a child actor in the early 1900s whose parents spent all the money he earned rather than putting it aside for him.Evelyn has been inundated with free products and sponsorship opportunities since gaining her audience. She wouldn’t disclose exactly how much money she’s made but did say she’s been saving up for a facial and eventually her college tuition.Still, she’s run into trouble with vague, nonpublic rules, and TikTok recently suspended her account, despite the fact that her mother updated its bio to reiterate that it was parent-run. TikTok, which does not provide direct support to most creators, even the most high-profile ones, has a history of banning creators without explanation. Evelyn and her mother, Alex, have been offered no explanation or appeal.“I take social media seriously, especially as it pertains to my daughter’s safety and privacy,” Alex said. “Not only did I create the TikTok account, submit my government ID as proof, I also am the sole individual that uploads content in addition to monitoring daily activity. To say we are incredibly disappointed to have our account taken away despite these precautions is an understatement.”But Evelyn hasn’t missed a beat on Instagram and YouTube, and she’s confident that she’ll rebuild her fan base on TikTok.TikTok is also completely unable to stymie her content. Dozens of fan accounts have re-uploaded all of Evelyn’s videos to the platform, amassing thousands of followers for those accounts. The only difference now is that those fan accounts are growing, instead of Evelyn’s.“It’s rare, what she’s doing,” said Evan Britton, CEO of Famous Birthdays, a website that charts the rise of online stars. Evelyn was added to Famous Birthdays in September and is already among the top 5,009 stars on the platform. “If you look at her engagement, she’s consistently mid-six figures,” Britton said, adding that skyrocketing engagement in her comment sections shows “she’s building a community … very quickly.”“She almost seems removed from the fact that she’s doing a video,” said Coco Mocoe, an online culture analyst. “Like almost, ‘I don’t want to be here,’ but of course she does want to be here, because she’s making the videos.”Evelyn has been working with Digital Futures, a Gen Z-focused media company. “We saw her coming when she had 2,000 followers,” said Veronica Zelle, Evelyn’s manager and co-founder of Digital Futures, who is working with Evelyn to accelerate her growth. “I’ve been spotting talent my entire career, and I know that Evelyn can inspire other Gen Z individuals with her honesty and authenticity.”Evelyn cycles through dozens of products in her videos, from skin creams to concealers to eye shadows and more. While her videos resonate most heavily with other tweens and teenagers, she has a strong following among millennial women (ages 27 to 42). These women say that Evelyn’s videos provide nostalgia, reminding them of the snarky girl in middle school they were often scared of but admired from afar. She’s often compared to a Regina George, the main character in the 2004 movie Mean Girls.Offline, Evelyn is well spoken and self-effacing. She’s aware that she has a specific online persona but said that she’s not a bully of any kind and that her videos are all in fun. “I think a lot of people who are older wish they were as assertive and outspoken as me when they were younger,” she said. She said she got her assertiveness from her mother. “I stand up for what I believe in, and I am very opinionated.”Though her videos can seem like she’s referencing specific people or situations, she said that they’re all anonymized or about things that happened years ago. “If [anyone] ever asked me to take a video down, of course I would,” she said. “Because nobody wants to be talked about on the internet.”Evelyn said she got into beauty, like many young people her age, through YouTube tutorials and vloggers. She received her first cellphone when she was in third grade and would consume hours of YouTube videos.Evelyn also obsesses over reading and writing, and several of her videos include books she’s picked up. She recently read “The Bell Jar” by Sylvia Plath and started George Orwell’s “1984.” She wants to be an author one day.Evelyn likes makeup and skin care because, like writing, it’s a way to express herself and be creative. “I feel like times have evolved, and a lot of young girls are getting interested in makeup, and that is okay,” she said. “Other people will play with slime when they’re younger. I feel like loving makeup and doing crazy looks is a canon event” — internet slang for a formative moment.One thing she doesn’t appreciate is the way the beauty industry can make girls feel bad about themselves. “I think it’s fine for [young girls] to enjoy makeup,” she said, “but I don’t think it’s okay for brands to create insecurity for girls. I feel like makeup should just be a fun thing that we all enjoy.”Like many popular content creators, Evelyn is divisive. Her videos have become a meme on the app, and adult creators have mocked her and critiqued her appearance.But because Evelyn doesn’t run her own accounts, her mother sees most of the hatred. Things can be especially bad on Instagram, where her mother has had to shut off comments on certain videos because they’ve gone viral outside of Evelyn’s core audience of young women.Industry analysts said part of why people clamor to buy the products Evelyn uses is specifically because she’s not overtly selling them.“Every marketer could take a lesson from her content,” said Sara Wilson, a digital strategist in Los Angeles.Evelyn’s ambitions include one day having a talk show and interviewing her idols, who include Taylor Swift and Mean Girls star Rachel McAdams.

Washington Post,You need not be a history buff to delight in ‘The Manuscripts Club’,2023-12-07 06:00:00,Michael Dirda,"“The Book of Kells,” “The Lindisfarne Gospels” and “The Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry” are not just illuminated manuscripts from the European Middle Ages, they are among the most revered works of art in the world. You have probably seen reproductions of these biblio-treasures, with their texts elegantly calligraphied on vellum, some capital letters hugely enlarged and richly decorated, and pages gloriously painted by hand with scenes from the Bible or, occasionally, contemporary life. In his 2017 book, “Meetings With Remarkable Manuscripts: Twelve Journeys Into the Medieval World,” Christopher de Hamel recounted the backstories for a dozen of these masterpieces, and he did so irresistibly by combining his scholarly authority, highly engaging prose and infectious personal enthusiasm. The book elicited rapturous blurbs and reviews from notables including playwright Tom Stoppard and former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, and went on to win Britain’s Wolfson History Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize.Having loved “Meetings With Remarkable Manuscripts,” I waited eagerly all fall for the American publication of “The Manuscripts Club: The People Behind a Thousand Years of Medieval Manuscripts” from de Hamel. I was not disappointed. As its subtitle suggests, the new book, designed as a companion to its predecessor, is a kind of portrait gallery, offering short biographies of 12 key figures in the making, selling and appreciation of illuminated manuscripts.Whom are we talking about? De Hamel assigns each of his subjects a label, so let me list them as they appear in his contents: The Monk: Saint Anselm, The Prince: The Duc de Berry, The Bookseller: Vespasiano da Bisticci, The Illuminator: Simon Bening, The Antiquary: Sir Robert Cotton, The Rabbi: David Oppenheim, The Savant: Jean-Joseph Rive, The Librarian: Sir Frederic Madden, The Forger: Constantine Simonides, The Editor: Theodor Mommsen, The Collector: Sir Sydney Cockerell and The Curator: Belle da Costa Greene.To add immediacy to his dives into the past, de Hamel, who for many years headed the department of Western manuscripts at Sotheby’s auction house, visits and describes sites associated with each of his dozen subjects. Thus he tours the ruins of Anselm’s 12th-century monastery at Bec in Normandy, describes the 19th-century library of the British Museum under Madden and his hated rival, Anthony Panizzi, and sets the dramatic story of Greene against the backdrop of New York’s great Morgan Library.De Hamel also re-creates what it would be like to meet and converse with each of his fellow enthusiasts for medieval missals, Books of Hours, scrolls and codices. Opinions may obviously differ, but I occasionally found these imaginary dialogues just a bit twee. That cavil aside, everything else about “The Manuscripts Club” is absolutely riveting. Only “Journeys of the Mind,” the scholarly autobiography of Peter Brown, our leading historian of late antiquity, rivals it as the most enthralling work of popular, humanistic scholarship of 2023.Take the chapter from de Hamel about Sir Robert Cotton (1571-1631). This nobleman collected manuscripts not for religious use or even for their beauty, but rather as key documents in shaping and defining English identity. He kept his treasures in bookcases designated with the names of various Roman emperors. De Hamel cannot resist — who could? — recalling just some of the works stored in the five-shelf “Nero” bookcase: the letters of Saint Anselm, the laws of King Alfred, the unique manuscript containing “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” the autograph diary of King Edward VI, the 8th-century “Lindisfarne Gospels” (“probably even now the most precious illuminated manuscript in Britain”) and much else. In adjoining cases were the Old English poem “Genesis,” five of the seven known copies of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the unique text of “Asser’s Life of King Alfred,” two of the surviving original copies of the Magna Carta, “and the only extant manuscript of any Anglo-Saxon epic, the incomparable ‘Beowulf’ itself.” He concludes with a flourish: “There were no mere printed books in the room at all.”Eventually, Cotton’s manuscripts were transferred to Ashburnham House, now part of Westminster School in London. One does not like to be superstitious, but that name, Ashburnham, was only too prophetic. When the great textual scholar Richard Bentley visited in 1731, something went wrong in his room’s fireplace, resulting in a conflagration: “The next day charred fragments from Cotton manuscripts were being gathered up from all about the ground outside.” Many irreplaceable works were destroyed, and “Beowulf” was badly charred, with losses to the text, but, miraculously, “The Lindisfarne Gospels” survived undamaged.De Hamel tells this story dramatically, but it takes only a few pages in a 40-page account of Cotton and his collection. For the chapter on David Oppenheim (1664-1736) he visits the grave of the rabbi in the Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague, then recounts the religious leader’s life as a collector and ends by examining some of his acquisitions with the Hebrew scholar Brian Deutsch. As de Hamel emphasizes, Torah scrolls would never be decorated, and it would be sacrilegious to show a picture of God. They are not, then, “illuminated.” In the Jewish tradition, reverence was for the text itself, and signs of long use mattered more rather than aesthetic appeal: “Many times at Sotheby’s, I would feel embarrassed to bring out some worn and damaged Hebrew manuscript to show to a Jewish collector, who would then sigh ecstatically, because thumbing and wear seemed to him to be almost a virtue. … Damage was evidence of past study, shared by others in a long tradition of the manuscript’s usefulness.”De Hamel closes his book with two astonishing modern lives. Sir Sydney Cockerell (1867-1962) started out as the secretary to William Morris and the Kelmscott Press, rising to become director of Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam Museum. Besides being an adept collector of manuscripts, he seems to have collected literary men and women, too. I own two volumes devoted to the affectionate letters sent to him by, among others, Algernon Swinburne, George Bernard Shaw, Leo Tolstoy, T.E. Lawrence (“of Arabia”), Thomas Hardy, W.B. Yeats, Max Beerbohm, Ezra Pound and Alec Guinness. As de Hamel indicates in 80 pages of voluminous endnotes, Cockerell introduced Robert Browning to John Ruskin, knew Henry James and met Albert Einstein. Still, the most meaningful correspondence of his life was with a cloistered but exceptionally learned nun, Dame Laurentia McLachlan.So, quite a man, but then Belle da Costa Greene (1879-1950) was quite a woman. J.P. Morgan’s private librarian was born to Black parents in Washington, but being light-skinned she chose to pass as White to avoid the racial prejudices of the time. Quick-witted, hard-working and passionate about manuscripts, the young Greene regarded Morgan as a foster father, deeply admired Cockerell, whose knowledge and guidance she often drew on, and fell passionately in love with the art connoisseur Bernard Berenson. Their affair was for her not just erotic but educational: They spent their days visiting the churches and museums of Europe. Following the death of her boss in 1913, Greene was appointed the first director of the Morgan Library, where she reigned until 1948. Her racial identity remained a secret until the late 1990s, when Jean Strouse was researching Morgan’s life and unearthed Greene’s birth certificate. Since then, there have been at least two novels written about her.While emphasizing the biographical and anecdotal, “The Manuscripts Club” does not neglect to interlace de Hamel’s insightful comments about the many and varied works pictured across its pages. Throughout, these reproductions of jeweled bindings, miniature paintings on vellum and exquisite calligraphy, as well as portraits or photographs of the owners of these treasures, convincingly illustrate key points in his observations and arguments.Anyone interested in medieval illumination, intellectual history, book collecting or the evolution of the art market should obviously seek out “The Manuscripts Club,” but so should readers who simply enjoy New Yorker-style profiles of the learned, colorful and obsessive. De Hamel could happily spend an evening studying a medieval Book of Hours, while his own marvelous book delivers, in its way, hours and hours of comparable instruction and delight.The People Behind a Thousand Years of Medieval ManuscriptsBy Christopher de Hamel",8589,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/12/07/manuscripts-club-hamel-book-review/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,conflagration ruin sacrilegious stoppard short opinion arabia insightful calligraphy christopher suggests grave kind richly book describes enjoy thumb backstories miniature elicit strouse bookcase colorful sydney reign western evolution biographical cooper matter wrong einstein law day oppenheim cockerell transfer key historian bernard saint school room avoid gawain robert prejudice story emphasize incomparable rivet department textual embarrass head tolstoy henry evidence john capital late history beauty designate virtue private set simon fell george ruskin bit birth site design page simply thomas flourish fireplace obsessive manuscriptsby former life original knew comparable jean simonides loss meaningful exceptionally bible cambridge anselm portrait result found racial introduce scholar middle carta differ knight fragment delivers meet collection morris wolfson medieval converse connoisseur codex literary humanistic label europe immediacy hand edward nobleman adept playwright admire certificate london hardy superstitious painting work irresistibly williams fellow william pound profile prose part death madden revere research green tres love rival ground algernon shaw personal seek knowledge calligraphied gloriously adjoin remarkable mommsen parent york backdrop include educational yeats frederic sigh examine anecdotal kells decorate dramatically foster engage normandy monk forger father roman asser enthusiast vellum woman english lawrence enthusiasm club time guinness rive varied sir house heures art cotton intellectual letter irreplaceable show correspondence antiquity prophetic offering vespasiano jeweled thousand greene magna list dialogue hebrew recount white sotheby anthony deutsch observation gather great ezra british ashburnham eagerly editor predecessor disappointed european astonish born dozen fall brian share appreciation voluminous win biography char jewish owner shape instruction american rowan beowulf westminster long close notable precious appeal britain enthral define secret theodor collector auction content devote leo happily unique illumination religious bisticci reader erotic companion regard passionately alec start review rabbi damage interlace write study endnotes library remain learn wait rapturous tradition masterpiece treasure resist archbishop tom church journey reverence interested cloister antiquary emperor miraculously probably king duc chose past acquisition tour imaginary costa monastery brown neglect contemporary prize albert meeting panizzi passionate modern browning james museum secretary appoint figure combine indicates constantine sign scene talk young nero exquisite market occasionally print press absolutely mind picture rich publication bening twee bring affair year hugely spent marvelous follow illuminate prince missal deeply chronicle drew god hamel leader berenson cemetery visit genesis dive associate case unearthed gospel dramatic assigns scholarship elegantly enlarge illuminator aesthetic kelmscott make illustrate belle librarian sell twelve store guidance popular text hour worn dame blurb autograph convincingly destroyed poem wear concludes add comment savant david affectionate black badly lindisfarne highly scroll fitzwilliam lead subtitle diary bentley reproduction max ecstatically richard feel laurentia bos binding infectious canterbury bookseller collect photograph gallery director document torah epic point emphasizes swinburne world copy prague alfred account spend recall cavil bec subject washington extant volume berry contain identity authority duff autobiography morgan beerbohm eventually age manuscript rise chapter scholarly curator paint survive,0.9982500000000001,0.20957038071952497,10.148863920099874,0.4962382445141066,0
Washington Post,"Nuns buy Smith & Wesson shares, then sue to stop production of AR-style rifles",2023-12-07 05:00:00,,"A coalition of Catholic nuns has filed a lawsuit against gunmaker Smith & Wesson, calling for the company to stop producing AR-style rifles, which the women claim are “the weapon of choice for numerous mass murderers.”The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in a Nevada district court, alleges that Smith & Wesson has repeatedly ignored “red flags” and failed to respond appropriately to mass shootings in the United States. The lawsuit references some of the deadliest mass killings in recent U.S. history — including at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012; a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018; and an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex., in 2022.Smith & Wesson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening. Lawrence Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group for gunmakers, described the lawsuit as “frivolous” in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.“This same group has been filing shareholder proposals and losing so I guess they’re trying a new tactic,” he told the paper.The nuns, who represent four congregations, said in a joint statement on Tuesday that AR-style rifles “have stolen the lives of so many innocent people and devastated communities across the nation.” They added that, as Smith & Wesson stockholders, they have supported resolutions for the company to explain to shareholders the “exposure to risk and liability” pertaining to its manufacturing of AR-style rifles.“These rifles have no purpose other than mass murder,” the statement read. “They are not the sporting rifles that members of our own families and other responsible gun owners value.”Jeffrey Norton, an attorney representing the nuns, said in a statement to The Washington Post that his clients are “activist investors,” meaning they buy stock in a company to pursue a certain goal.“We are proud to partner with these congregations of Catholic Sisters who have long sought corporate responsibility through their shareholder activism,” Norton said in a news release on Tuesday.The action is not the first of its kind. In 2018, shareholders, including some faith-based organizations, passed a resolution requiring Smith & Wesson to create a report about how it would address the safety risks its products posed, CNBC reported. Smith & Wesson has also faced several lawsuits from shooting survivors and victims’ families.Founded in 1852, Smith & Wesson produced pistols, revolvers and other firearms for more than 150 years before it began producing long guns in 2006. The company’s first rifle series debuted in February of that year.Afterward, Smith & Wesson saw a rise in profits and was “seemingly unfazed by the exponential rise in gun deaths and mass shootings carried out with its product,” the lawsuit alleges. It adds that AR-style rifles were used in mass killings, including in Colorado Springs, Nashville and Uvalde.Smith & Wesson producing such weapons makes “it more difficult and more dangerous for law enforcement to respond” to mass killings, the lawsuit states, referencing the Robb Elementary School massacre in Uvalde, where officers waited more than an hour before entering a classroom to confront the gunman.The nuns also accuse Smith & Wesson of using “aesthetic marketing,” including advertisements that are geared toward young people “despite the fact that many states impose age restrictions” on purchasing firearms. Smith & Wesson also does not have a system for “tracking injuries and deaths caused by” its rifles, “whether from accidental discharge, product malfunction, or deliberate use,” the lawsuit alleges.The suit calls on Smith & Wesson to revise its policies to protect the company and stockholders “from a repeat of the damaging events.” In their statement Tuesday, the nuns urged Smith & Wesson to return to its production cycle pre-2006 — before it manufactured long guns and “held itself as a successful beacon of responsible gun ownership.”One of the first pages of the lawsuit is taken up almost entirely by a single photo captured in the aftermath of the attack in the Aurora movie theater.The image shows the AR-style rifle the gunman used in the attack laying between a pair of bright pink flip flops, the ground splattered with blood.",4213,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/12/07/smith-wesson-catholic-nuns-lawsuit/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,splatter steal respond survivor spring enter innocent cnbc confront firearm return blood activism profit request unfazed urge owner mass weapon sought kind revise track stop long lose described pursue manufacturing smith interview entirely discharge enforcement classroom lay address company system difficult represent law malfunction damage responsible theater told norton exponential shareholder release wait school jeffrey aftermath wednesday file flop pose buy repeatedly explain stock carry begin partner devastate production impose wesson pistol elementary history produce aurora gear corporate uvalde shooting pertain deliberate red action pink proud young page gunmaker wall reference meaning require national safety filing accuse life year gun immediately shoot claim alleges post client single member held report sport gunmakers victim massacre purchasing despite parkland tactic responsibility congregation repeat liability dangerous accidental photo attack foundation aesthetic appropriately make stockholder manufacture court fail cycle deadliest movie joint policy colorado flag debut successful recent united killing family hour beacon nashville exposure support flip tuesday add investor attorney comment group death purpose activist sister ground fact guess state proposal rifle trade ignore risk gunman marketing keane street revolver image high injury protect include catholic suit murder woman lawrence february frivolous nevada restriction coalition statement washington news seemingly show pair create numerous bright age capture robb district resolution product rise choice read community call pass lawsuit organization officer advertisement series,-0.98875,0.28483266081177305,10.959687906371908,0.4762279942279942,0
Washington Post,Venezuela’s threats to annex most of Guyana draw international concern,2023-12-07 03:35:00,"Andrew Jeong, Matthew Hay Brown","It might be only a political stunt by an unpopular leader trying to win reelection. But threats by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to annex nearly three-quarters of oil-rich Guyana are drawing international concern.In a television appearance this week, Maduro presented a map that showed Guyana’s 61,000-square-mile Esequibo region as part of Venezuela. The authoritarian socialist told a crowd of government officials and supporters that he would create the Venezuelan state Guyana Esequiba, grant Venezuelan citizenship to its Guyanese residents, license the state oil company PDVSA and state metal conglomerate CVG to search it for oil and order energy companies currently there, including Houston-based ExxonMobil, to leave in three months.“The world has to know — the Republic of Guyana has to know,” he said, “the Esequibo is ours.”The reaction has been swift. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva offered Thursday to mediate between the South American neighbors. The U.N. Security Council scheduled a closed-door meeting on the matter for Friday. The U.S. Embassy in Guyana announced joint flight operations Thursday by the Guyana Defense Force and U.S. Southern Command.Venezuela has long claimed the Esequibo, a sparsely populated region of forest, swamp and scrubland. It’s a rare point of agreement in the deeply divided country; generations of schoolchildren have been raised on maps like the one Maduro wielded during his address Tuesday.Guyana has repeatedly rejected those claims, saying an 1899 international arbitration resolved the dispute. Venezuela has challenged the validity of that ruling. Its objections have intensified since ExxonMobil discovered massive reserves of oil in the ocean floor off the territory in 2015, a windfall that has turned Guyana, previously one of the hemisphere’s poorest countries, into one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.The International Court of Justice — to which the United Nations, at Guyana’s urging, has referred the matter — urged both sides last week to refrain from “any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute.”Maduro’s bluster seems unlikely to escalate to action. He and several members of his inner circle are under federal criminal indictment in the United States on charges of narcoterrorism. The once-booming oil industry — the country is home to the world’s largest proven reserves — has been crippled by outdated infrastructure, chronic mismanagement and U.S. sanctions.Amid an economic collapse, Maduro has worked to improve relations with Washington. The Biden administration agreed in October to ease some restrictions on Venezuela’s oil sector in exchange for Maduro’s pledge to hold freer elections next year — a breakthrough between the two countries, which severed diplomatic relations in 2019.But his remarks on Esequibo have unsettled Guyana and drawn warnings from the United States and Brazil.Guyanese President Irfaan Ali told CNN this week that Maduro’s declaration was a “desperate attempt by Venezuela to seize” his country’s territories. “We are taking every precautionary measure,” he said, including appeals to the United States, Brazil and the United Nations for diplomatic and military support to deter a Venezuelan invasion.The State Department confirmed the contact. “Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke with Guyanese President Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali to reaffirm the United States’ unwavering support for Guyana’s sovereignty,” the department said late Wednesday. Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that Washington supports a peaceful resolution.Brazil reinforced its northern border with armored vehicles and more troops, Reuters reported this week. Because Esequibo is largely inaccessible, the main road connecting Venezuela and Guyana runs through Brazil. Senior Brazilian diplomats have conveyed serious concerns to Venezuela, Reuters reported.In a referendum on Sunday, Maduro said, more than 95 percent of Venezuelan voters expressed support for annexing Esequibo.That percentage could reflect the actual popularity of the measure. But the government’s claim that more than 10 million Venezuelans cast ballots in the vote “makes no sense,” according to Enderson Sequera, strategic director for the Venezuela-based political analysis firm Politiks. That would be an unusually high turnout for Venezuela.Oil is not the only motivating factor for Maduro, Sequera said. The fixation on Esequibo also represents a sense of political insecurity following María Corina Machado’s resounding victory in the opposition’s presidential primaries in October. Machado, a longtime government critic, could present a formidable challenge Maduro in an election next year.",4710,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/07/venezuela-guyana-esequibo-map-border-dispute/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAQNBJNQWME6VNKXFHLX5SCWQU.JPG&w=1200 1200w",International News,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country conveyed raise socialist refer aggravate ocean win circle reaffirm guyana resolve threat urge strategic arbitration rare american side sunday charge improve intensified long troop vehicle dispute firm popularity large economic reserve draw appeal senior inacio leave primary miller antony windfall neighbor cripple address offer company embassy represent freer matter relation metal express percentage told poorest chronic nicolás cnn inaccessible critic mohamed schoolchildren refrain matthew deter insecurity wednesday cast ballot present repeatedly department biden reporter contact sequera accord warning fixation oil narcoterrorism energy maduro military reelection nation late referendum political extend unusually region southern crowd october drawn floor meeting measure enderson challenged spoke venezuelan turnout operation secretary home million authoritarian spokesman television action reuters unpopular international agree exxonmobil confirm border escalate turn map search remark friday opposition wield year machado precautionary connect resident populate claim supporter swift follow member politiks venezuela motivate deeply report sever pledge lula official leader corina desperate reflect sparsely outdated irfaan criminal swamp justice defense luiz ruling objection esequiba formidable peaceful force appearance make resound schedule factor voter blinken flight bluster court annex analysis exchange victory joint hemisphere administration scrubland mismanagement largely concern declaration reinforce road stunt cvg united industry unsettled validity diplomatic seize proven northern diplomat work license grant silva support president actual part citizenship forest presidential sovereignty infrastructure week state challenge high armored claimed conglomerate sector guyanese vote federal include director percent republic esequibo run council unwavering point government previously pdvsa reaction world announce restriction maría order hold thursday collapse washington generation brazil show agreement brazilian create election discover ease mediate divide indictment south breakthrough massive attempt security longtime territory reject currently,0.9539,0.12738853503184713,13.268030303030304,0.35448677248677246,0
Washington Post,Biden backs Indigenous team playing lacrosse under own flag at 2028 Olympics,2023-12-07 03:20:00,,"President Biden on Wednesday announced his support for the Haudenosaunee Confederacy — a league of Indigenous nations in the United States and Canada — competing under their own flag in lacrosse at the 2028 Summer Olympics. His endorsement challenges traditional representation at the international competition and is seen as a step toward a historic moment for a team that has long fought for global recognition.The 2028 Los Angeles Games will be the first time lacrosse has been officially contested at the Olympics in more than a century, and the Haudenosaunee’s participation would honor their long legacy in the sport, which descends from a game their ancestors created nearly a thousand years ago. Their team, the Haudenosaunee Nationals, is ranked third in the world in men’s field lacrosse, eighth for women’s field and has won bronze at the past three World Lacrosse Men’s Championships. (Lacrosse will be played in a style known as sixes at the Olympics.)“Their ancestors invented the game. They perfected it for a millennia,” Biden said at the Tribal Nations Summit in Washington.“Their circumstances are unique, and they should be granted an exception to field their own team at the Olympics,” he said, calling their players “among the very best in the world.”Canada’s sport minister also offered her support on Wednesday.In a joint statement with World Lacrosse, the sport’s governing body, the Haudenosaunee Nationals thanked the president, writing that “recognition of the cultural significance of lacrosse to the Haudenosaunee people — and the Haudenosaunee people to lacrosse — is an important step in our Olympic journey.”Fawn Porter, a player on the team, said in a statement that Biden’s support “reflects a shared commitment to fostering inclusivity, and will help build momentum” as the Haudenosaunee strive to “bring the medicine of lacrosse to the world.”Including the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora nations, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (or “people of the long house”) was called the Iroquois by the French. Sometimes also referred to as the Six Nations, Haudenosaunee land spans Upstate New York and parts of Canada.Regarded as the oldest sport in North America, lacrosse’s origins can be traced back to the 12th century, when Native American tribes played what was known as stickball, a game estimated to include 100 to 100,000 players. Early versions of the sport held “significant cultural and spiritual importance, often serving as rituals and training for war,” according to World Lacrosse.The LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games wrote in a statement sent by email that it was excited to work with the organizing bodies to “find a solution that honors the sport’s heritage and allows participation for Haudenosaunee Lacrosse athletes, while respecting the Olympic Games framework established by the IOC.”“Rarely does an organizing committee have the opportunity to include a sport in its program that has such an important history as Lacrosse does with the indigenous peoples of North America,” the statement said.For the Haudenosaunee to make their Olympic debut, the International Olympic Committee must approve their participation, placing the committee “in a difficult position,” Christine O’Bonsawin, a professor of history and Indigenous studies at the University of Victoria in Canada, said by email.High-ranking leaders “publicly and unequivocally” supporting the move will “demand that the IOC give serious consideration to the involvement of this, and perhaps other Indigenous nations, in these and future Olympic Games,” she said.Typically, the IOC requires teams to compete under a National Olympic Committee, which the Haudenosaunee do not have, though there is precedent for exceptions, such the Refugee Olympic Team included in the Rio and Tokyo Olympics.Since their founding in 1983, the Haudenosaunee Nationals have repeatedly faced obstacles to global inclusion. In 2020, they were deemed ineligible for the 2022 World Games, despite placing ahead of teams invited to compete.

Washington Post,Washington Post staffers walk out in biggest labor protest in 48 years,2023-12-07 00:27:00,,"More than 750 Washington Post employees said they had walked off the job Thursday, refusing to work for 24 hours in the biggest labor protest at the company in nearly half a century.Workers marched in a picket line outside The Post’s offices in downtown Washington, waving “Strike” signs, ringing bells, blowing horns, beating drums and chanting, “Hey, hey, ho, ho, our salary floor is much too low!”But even as strikers asked readers to abstain from the newspaper and its website for the day in solidarity, editors and other managers carried on with many of the tasks that go into producing a daily news report, from writing articles to operating printing presses.Union members said they are protesting a stalemate in bargaining with the company that has left workers without a contract for 18 months. They also object to the company’s recent offer of cost-saving buyouts to staff members, saying that the terms are stingy and that the ostensibly voluntary packages are being coerced by a threat of layoffs.“This is a declaration by hundreds of Washington Post staffers saying that if the company is to work with us fairly, it has to respect its employees,” said Sarah Kaplan, a climate reporter and steward for The Washington Post Guild.“I know they will still try to get a paper out,” she added. “But they can’t get a good paper out without us.”Company executives deny the union’s claim that it has bargained in “bad faith” and say they still hope to reach a contract agreement by the end of the month.“We respect the rights of our Guild-covered colleagues to engage in this planned one-day strike,” a company spokesperson said. “We will make sure our readers and customers are as unaffected as possible.”The company expressed confidence that it would be able to print and deliver newspapers as usual Thursday and Friday, while keeping its website updated as well.But in at least one way, the effect of the walkout was obvious to readers: Many reporters, photographers and other journalists withheld their names from their work.The walkout comes as The Post is grappling with leadership turnover as well as the same economic challenges that have rocked the media industry worldwide.After a decade of rapid growth under the ownership of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, executives acknowledged this fall that the company had expanded too far and that it would be forced to cut back after optimistic financial projections didn’t materialize. The Post is set to lose $100 million this year — the impetus for the buyout offers, which executives hope will result in 240 voluntary departures, or about 10 percent of the current staff. About half of those cuts would come from the newsroom.Meanwhile, the company will get a new publisher and chief executive in January. William Lewis, a British-born longtime media executive most recently with the Wall Street Journal, was tapped last month to replace Fred Ryan, who stepped down earlier this year.It has been 48 years since the last major labor walkout at The Post. In the fall of 1975, printing press workers led a strike that lasted 20 weeks — a chaotic period in which some workers disabled the presses and company executives operated the machinery and printed the newspapers themselves. Most journalists, though, did not participate in the strike, and ultimately, Publisher Katharine Graham hired replacement workers to run the presses, essentially breaking their union.Today, though, Guild members say enthusiasm for organizing is on the rise. About 75 percent of eligible Post employees are now dues-paying members of the union, up from about 40 percent five years ago.It follows a larger uptick in labor organizing within the media world. The walkout at The Post mirrors one almost exactly a year ago at the New York Times, where more than 1,100 employees ceased work for a day to protest deadlocked contract negotiations. The two sides settled on a new contract five months later.Post Guild statements indicate that bargaining has bogged down on matters such as salaries — the union is seeking minimums of $100,100 for reporters, for example, while The Post’s latest offer is $73,000 — and the size of annual cost-of-living raises.“Our salaries are not keeping up with inflation or keeping up with our competitors,” Kaplan said, adding that The Post has lost too many employees to other news organizations for this reason.The Post’s bargaining committee counters that it has signaled openness to the Guild’s request for longer contracts and agreed to many of its other priorities. Its current offer provides “significant” changes to minimum salaries, the committee said, and annual increases that are “more generous than typical Guild contracts signed in the last two decades.”“The Post has made its last, best and final offer to the Guild,” a Post spokesperson said.The buyout plan, though, remains a source of tension and anxiety in the newsroom. Guild members argue that the offers — which range from six months to two years of base pay, depending on tenure — could be far more generous, because the company is paying for them out of a richly overfunded pension fund. Meanwhile, some who have been offered a buyout, they say, feel coerced by warnings that The Post will resort to layoffs if the company doesn’t have enough voluntary departures.Last week, interim CEO Patty Stonesifer said that only about 120 employees had accepted an offer, half of what is needed just weeks before a mid-December deadline.Katie Mettler, a reporter who covers courts and crime in Maryland and co-chair of the Guild, said earlier this week that participating in the walkout meant that she might be absent for a key day in the trial of a police officer charged with fatally shooting a handcuffed man.“It’s possible the verdict will come while I’m walking out,” she said. “I don’t take that lightly. I’m sure someone from The Washington Post will be in court Thursday. But they won’t know the case like I do.”As it happened, the trial ended Wednesday afternoon with an acquittal. The Post story about it published without a byline — attributing it only to “Washington Post staff.”A lunchtime protest rally outside The Post headquarters on K Street Northwest featured a 12-foot inflatable rat, a union symbol disparaging strikebreakers and nonunion workers. Guest speakers included trailblazing journalist Dorothy Butler Gilliam, the first Black female reporter at The Post; Mark Dimondstein, head of the American Postal Workers Union; and leaders of the larger NewsGuild-CWA union, under which the Post Guild is organized.“This is the entire working class out here with you!” cheered Sara Nelson, leader of the Association of Flight Attendants. She praised the work of Post journalists who she said had brought accountability to the airline industry.“This work matters,” she said. “It matters to a free society, it matters to democracy.” And she took a crack at Bezos, who purchased the newspaper 10 years ago for $250 million: “What the hell good is it to have a billionaire owner if you can’t get the proper investments in the company?”Fenit Nirappil, a health and science reporter, was one of many Post employees who spoke to the crowd. He said a key issue for his colleagues is fairness in pay.“I was hired seven years ago close to the minimum salary at The Washington Post for reporters,” he said, adding that it is “not competitive” with minimum salaries at The Post’s rival news organizations.",7433,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2023/12/07/washington-post-staff-walkout-strike-labor/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police climate leadership fall increase depend chant change respect stonesifer back layoff bogged line settle threat request cover tension replacement hey owner interim remains side richly american trial charge major half typical lightly uptick headquarters lose close large economic impetus disabled annual generous ceo strikebreaker free newspaper nonunion lewis tenure graham argue happen afternoon handcuffed female offer company reader effect guild matter rat labor day beating express write meant decade key striker executive crime reach nirappil newsroom expand praise wednesday medium turnover financial story colleague kaplan carry strike head reporter deliver deny symbol butler package solidarity warning paper departure sarah tapped mirror worker late crowd steward voluntary floor produce current bell significant northwest set break spoke society abstain customer million dorothy sign ostensibly airline growth maryland acquittal agree dimondstein projection wall staffer guest accountability ago speaker ring disparage website print period resort press friday attribute absent year shoot publish stalemate verdict claim step post acknowledge ryan object walkout follow member publisher result report spokesperson billionaire negotiation downtown buyout january usual leader amazon blowing minimum lunchtime rock pension fairness ownership fairly salary case operate photographer katharine inflation operating range force essentially make mettler competitor flight chief founder court officer possible purchase fenit fatally organize declaration hire feature deadlocked contract plan refuse inflatable recent competitive industry hour drum journalist work recently mark obvious william article month science counter job investment hundred add printing walk accepted bezos withheld eligible machinery black coerce signal patty base term grapple jeff journal rapid rival week lead participate priority nelson street crack seek wave low task union update challenge manager trailblazing feel replace staff big confidence anxiety entire overfunded earlier york pay include percent fund stingy run engage left association protest world class longer cheer employee indicate health attendant enthusiasm picket time thursday cut statement brought washington cease postal issue office final openness news materialize hell provide agreement bargain ultimately byline bargaining daily rally faith optimistic chaotic hope horn source gilliam proper march unaffected rise longtime fred size organization editor committee,0.7706500000000001,0.04036055428494551,9.5368480565371,0.4470321189422311,0
Washington Post,Panthers’ Hayden Hurst says his memory loss isn’t career-ending,2023-12-06 23:35:00,,"Hayden Hurst of the Carolina Panthers has been diagnosed with post-traumatic amnesia, according to his father. But the tight end wrote Thursday on social media that, although he doesn’t remember “up to four hours after the game,” the injury is not career-ending.“I appreciate everyone reaching out & checking on me. I suffered a pretty nasty concussion against the Bears a few weeks ago & don’t remember up to 4 hours after the game,” he wrote on X. “Scary situation but the Panthers have been incredible walking me through this process.“While it was scary, it is NOT career ending. I’m starting my return to play this week, so fingers crossed I make it back for the last few weeks! God Bless & Keep Pounding!!!!”His father had announced the injury Wednesday on X.“Slow recovery, don’t know when he’ll be back,” Jerry Hurst wrote of his son, who has been sidelined for several weeks with a concussion. “Prayers appreciated!”The post by Hurst’s father was shared the same day that Hurst, a 30-year-old in his sixth NFL season, returned to the practice field for the first time since getting injured in a Nov. 9 game at Chicago. He was said by the team to have participated in a limited capacity while wearing a red no-contact jersey.“He’s working his way through the [concussion] protocol,” Panthers interim coach Chris Tabor said of Hurst Wednesday at a regularly scheduled news conference. “That was just another step to see where he’s at. We’ll get an evaluation at the end of today and see how he did.”The Panthers did not comment publicly Wednesday on the claim made by Hurst’s father. The diagnosis, Jerry Hurst wrote, was made by an independent neurologist.According to an essay shared in 2018 by England’s Hull University Teaching Hospitals, post-traumatic amnesia is “a transient state of confusion, disorientation and memory loss that occurs immediately following a traumatic brain injury.” It can last just a few minutes or, in some cases, can stretch for weeks or months. The length a patient suffers from it can point toward the severity of the original brain injury. The memory loss mainly affects post-injury events, and after recovery patients may retain “islands” of recollections from the affected period.Hurst is in his first season with the Panthers after one year with the Cincinnati Bengals. A first-round pick in 2018 out of South Carolina, he began his NFL career with the Baltimore Ravens before being traded in 2020 to the Atlanta Falcons.",2464,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/06/hayden-hurst-father-post-traumatic-amnesia/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Sports,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,slow atlanta length social chicago share remember back return minute case teach hurst bear interim patient make diagnose schedule england falcon sideline prayer recollection bengal independent amnesia appreciate regularly traumatic baltimore hayden concussion x hour confusion situation panther work scary chris brain finger pound wear month practice tight start sixth hull comment publicly day walk write raven season week conference check state game participate reach trade wednesday recovery medium nasty retain pretty injury begin occurs cincinnati accord coach cross affect bless career event hospital island point affected father evaluation protocol nfl suffer injured jerry red university announce thursday time team carolina severity play limited incredible tabor today news memory ago suffers pick original disorientation field year immediately essay claim step post loss capacity follow south stretch transient diagnosis god,-0.95025,0.12175324675324675,7.525450901803609,0.32036852036852037,0
Washington Post,Big Tech funds the very people who are supposed to hold it accountable,2023-12-06 11:11:00,"Joseph Menn, Naomi Nix","Tech giants including Google and Facebook parent Meta have dramatically ramped up charitable giving to university campuses over the past several years — giving them influence over academics studying such critical topics as artificial intelligence, social media and disinformation.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg alone has donated money to more than 100 university campuses, through either Meta or his personal philanthropy arm, according to new research by the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog group studying the technology industry. Other firms are helping fund academic centers, doling out grants to professors and sitting on advisory boards reserved for donors, researchers told The Post.Silicon Valley’s influence is most apparent among computer science professors at such top-tier schools as the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Toronto, Stanford and MIT. According to a 2021 paper by University of Toronto and Harvard researchers, most tenure-track professors in computer science at those schools whose funding sources could be determined had taken money from the technology industry, including nearly 6 of 10 scholars of AI.The proportion rose further in certain controversial subjects, the study found. Of 33 professors whose funding could be traced who wrote on AI ethics for the top journals Nature and Science, for example, all but one had taken grant money from the tech giants or had worked as their employees or contractors.Academics say they are increasingly dependent on tech companies to access the large amounts of data required to study social behavior, including the spread of disinformation and hate speech. Both Meta and X, formerly Twitter, have reduced the flow of that data to researchers, requiring them to negotiate special deals to obtain access or pay far more, respectively.This shifting power dynamic was thrust into the spotlight Monday with news that renowned disinformation researcher Joan Donovan had filed complaints with state and federal officials against Harvard University. Donovan claims that the personal connections of Meta executives — along with a mammoth $500 million grant for AI research — were behind her ouster this year from the Harvard Kennedy School. Harvard has denied that it was improperly influenced.“Big Tech has played this game really successfully in the past decade,” said Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School professor who previously founded Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society without raising money outside the university. “The number of academics who have been paid by Facebook alone is extraordinary.”Most tech-focused academics say their work is not influenced by the companies, and the journals that publish their studies have ethics rules designed to ward off egregious interference. But in interviews, two dozen professors said that by controlling funding and access to data, tech companies wield “soft power,” slowing down research, sparking tension between academics and their institutions, and shifting the fields’ targets in small — but potentially transformative — ways.“It’s subtle. It just sort of creeps in,” McGill University professor Taylor Owen said.Owen had brushes with corporate power when Meta’s Canadian public policy head Kevin Chan joined the advisory board of McGill’s public policy school. Chan complained about the school publicizing Owen’s research, which was critical of the company, and suggested that Meta could fund intensive classes proposed for educating journalists. After Owen objected, the school turned that offer down. Chan did not reply to a request for comment.While Meta didn’t dispute the Transparency Project’s accounting of its grants, spokesman David Arnold said gifts to academic institutions are designed to “better understand our platforms’ impact” and that the “anti-tech organizations” supporting the Transparency Project also fund academic research.“We of course want this research to be rigorous and unbiased,” Arnold said. “It would be wrong for us not to support external academic research and, in fact, the calls for us to do more of this are only growing.”Many academics say the explosion of AI is accelerating ties between the industry and universities — normalizing a system in which some stars of academia draw salaries from companies like Meta and Google while continuing to teach on campus.“They pay for the research of the very people in a position to criticize them,” said Hany Farid, a UC-Berkeley professor in computer science and at the School of Information. “It’s what the oil and gas industry has done with climate change, and it’s what the tobacco companies did with cigarette research.”Farid, who says he has taken money from most of the major companies, got $2 million from Meta in 2019 to study deepfakes and integrity in news posts on Facebook. But the following year, after he was critical of Meta in a media interview, he says that a company employee told him the social media giant was upset. Though Farid doesn’t think the conversation was intended to be menacing, it was an unwelcome reminder of who was paying the bills.He walked away from the remainder of the funds, citing to The Post “a disconnect between the research and the policy decisions.”Farid said it was “highly unlikely” he would partner with the organization again. Meta said it disputed the characterization but declined to discuss the previously unreported rift.Scholarship on the impact of technology ballooned after the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal and revelations that Russian operatives used social media to attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election. As public scrutiny of Facebook and other companies increased, policymakers began to rely on academics for unvarnished information about the dangers of social media.Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University, likened this scholarship to efforts to understand the automobile. “The early cars were wildly unsafe, and we needed to study them and figure out how to make them safer,” she said. “This is why science exists, so we can both have these important things but also make sure that society’s interests are well represented.”However, academics, universities and government agencies have been overhauling, cutting back or ending disinformation research programs amid lawsuits and investigations by Republican regulators and conservative activists, who accuse them of colluding with tech companies to censor right-wing views.The rapid growth of AI has triggered close relationships between companies and academics. This fall, the University of Cambridge used Google money to expand the work of the Centre for Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence to advance AI research “for the benefit of humanity.”Two leaders of Meta’s Fundamental AI Research team, Yann LeCun and Joelle Pineau, also hold positions at New York University and McGill, respectively. Geoffrey Hinton, often called the “godfather of AI,” taught at the University of Toronto while serving as Google’s top AI expert. Hinton said that he worked for Google only half-time for 10 years and that his university appointment “was mainly advising graduate students on theses they had already started.” LeCun and Pineau did not respond to requests for comment.“We are proud to openly fund research on a range of important topics such as responsible AI,” said Google spokesperson José Castañeda. “We value the independence and integrity of researchers and their work, and we expect and require them to properly disclose their funding.”Google was one of the first modern tech giants to fund research at universities, funding 331 research papers on subjects relevant to Google’s business interests from 2005 to 2017, according to the Tech Transparency Project. Often that funding was not disclosed, and the papers were circulated to policymakers and the media.The most popular topic of those papers was antitrust law, peaking during the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust investigation of Google.Even grants from tech giants that come without restrictive requirements leave researchers worrying their funds might dry up. Before the 2016 election, Google began pouring millions of dollars into a coalition of academics and nonprofits called First Draft. The collective became one of the earliest voices on disinformation, publishing early research that sometimes impugned its biggest funder.After contributing $4.5 million one year, Google cut its funding more than 90 percent the next, according to a person familiar with the effort. The group shut down in 2022.“They never told us what we could or couldn’t publish, but I did wonder, if I come out with a terrible exposé, is that going to prevent us from getting money later?” said a coalition member who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss politically sensitive issues.For scholars, tech company money is often hard to turn down. Funding can be hard to come by and is often limited to a narrow set of research interests.“For most of the past 25 years the federal government has underfunded social-science research into the effects of digital technology,” University of Virginia professor Siva Vaidhyanathan said. “Foundations … have historically tended to avoid directly funding basic research. So for many years the tech companies were the only major source of research funding.”Though he said he saw no evidence of bias in company-funded research, the industry has impact in “what gets promoted and emphasized.”The American Association of University Professors has acknowledged scandals including economics professors paid by sellers of mortgage-backed securities who downplayed risks of such products before the 2008 economic collapse. In a 2014 book, the association noted that pressure was “mounting, even in the humanities and other traditional nonmarket disciplines, to become more commercially ‘relevant’ and to generate private revenue.”It welcomed outside funding but urged faculty bodies to pay close attention, draft detailed rules and enforce them.Tech companies are also curtailing access to the internal data many researchers have used for their work. Elon Musk has begun charging thousands of dollars to researchers for previously free access to large volumes of posts on X, limiting the pool of academics who can study the platform effectively. In 2021, Meta disabled accounts associated with NYU’s Ad Observatory project, crippling the widely heralded initiative to research how political ads target users, citing privacy concerns about their use of the data.Meta bought and then reduced support for the social media tracking tool CrowdTangle, which academics use to analyze how specific ideas spread. Last month, Meta unveiled new tools for researchers to analyze public data.Joining up with tech companies to gain access to data comes with its own set of struggles. In 2018 Meta, then known as Facebook, announced Social Science One, a partnership with researchers to study the social network’s impact on elections. Facebook agreed to give scholars a set of web addresses shared by users to measure the flow of misinformation.But Social Science One’s work was delayed when the company didn’t release the promised data, citing privacy concerns, and some funders pulled out. The researchers finally got the full data set in October 2021, three years after the project’s start.In 2020, Meta tried again. Though Meta did not pay the academics, 10 of the 17 researchers selected had previously received research grants from the company or worked for it as a consultant, the group disclosed. To protect against surprises, Meta employees pushed the academics to define in advance what would qualify as a major impact, said Michael W. Wagner, a University of Wisconsin journalism professor who served as an observer of the collaboration. The researchers agreed.Yet researchers and Meta still clashed over how to interpret results.The studies suggested that small experimental interventions, like making the Facebook news feed chronological, didn’t impact political polarization. Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg touted the findings as part of “a growing body of research showing there is little evidence that key features of Meta’s platforms alone cause harmful ‘affective’ polarization or have meaningful effects on these outcomes.” In interviews, researchers said the results were a far cry from saying Meta did not increase divisions.Samuel Woolley, a University of Texas misinformation expert, noted a clear trend in such conflicts. “There’s all of this momentum toward creating a systematic effort to study things,” Woolley said. “Promises get made, and then suddenly things seem to stop.”Woolley, who studies how groups use propaganda, decided not to obtain company data for his 2018 book, “Computational Propaganda.” He described the process of cobbling together data from other sources as excruciating — “like assembling a patchwork quilt” — but necessary. “I had a realization early on that doing quantitative research in this space was always going to be a heartbreaking endeavor,” he said.Harvard’s Lessig, who spent years heading a center on ethics issues in society at the university, is developing a system for academics to verify that their research is truly independent. He hopes to present the initiative, the Academic Integrity Project, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.",13402,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/06/academic-research-meta-google-university-influence/,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VRLWIZJLWFHEBF6BD62GC7XW7M.jpg&w=440

Washington Post,Mpox surge in Congo raises concerns world will ignore warnings again,2023-12-06 06:00:00,,"A surge of mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo has raised concerns of another global outbreak with more deaths than the one ignited last year, prompting scientists to worry the world will again fail to recognize warnings from Africa.For the first time, scientists have identified sexual transmission of a version of the mpox virus that is linked to more fatalities in a region where mpox is endemic and more typically transmitted through contact with infected animals.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday warned people who have traveled to Congo to be on the lookout for rashes caused by the virus and issued a similar alert to health providers on Thursday. The World Health Organization released a report in November detailing Congo’s worst surge on record, with nearly 13,000 suspected cases and 581 suspected deaths this year.While there’s no evidence of another global outbreak starting, health authorities are especially attuned to a virus that was declared an international and U.S. health emergency last year.The WHO warned that the situation in Congo, if not controlled, poses a significant risk of international outbreaks “with potentially more severe consequences than the one which has been affecting the world since 2022.”The unfolding situation underscores long-standing tensions about how mpox is treated in African countries where it’s endemic, renewing questions about health equity: Has the world failed to learn that infectious-disease threats in poor countries pose global threats? Why isn’t the vaccine that helped quell the mpox outbreak in the West available in Africa? And would homophobia and stigma inhibit efforts to contain sexual transmission of the virus in Congo?Mpox circulated broadly outside of Africa for the first time last year, infecting more than 92,000 worldwide, mostly through male-to-male sexual contact. Authorities traced the international spread to festivals and other large events where men had sex with other men.Experts were relieved that cases outside of Africa were driven by a group of viruses, known as clade 2b, that caused less severe disease. The global death toll from confirmed mpox cases is 167 since 2022, according to the WHO. People with untreated HIV who contract mpox face higher risk of death.“The story of mpox didn’t end last year,” said Jason Kindrachuk, an associate professor of medical microbiology and infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba’s Max Rady College of Medicine who is studying Congo’s outbreak. “This has been a five-decades-long struggle for people that inhabit endemic regions of the world.”Now authorities have confirmed sexual spread of clade 1 in Congo in at least two dozen cases; clade 1 has a higher fatality rate than the version that spread internationally last year. A cluster of several cases in people who had sex with an mpox patient has caught attention, as has an unconnected case involving a man who has sex with other men and an outbreak that includes 20 sex workers in an eastern province of Congo that had never reported mpox before.The discoveries are concerning because sex has proved to be a far more efficient way for the virus to spread than other forms of skin-to-skin contact, animal bites and scratches, or consuming contaminated bushmeat. Nonsexual spread had accounted for most transmissions in parts of Africa where the virus has circulated for decades.It’s unclear to what extent sex is driving the broader surge of the virus in Congo, where mpox cases this year are more than double the previous high of 6,216 cases reported in 2020. Every 2 out of 3 tests are coming back positive, a high rate that suggests the virus is more widespread than the official tally, according to the WHO. Infections have spread throughout the country in places that had not previously reported the virus, including urban areas such as the capital, Kinshasa, and provinces that border other countries.“Something new might be happening,” said Rosamund Lewis, the WHO’s technical lead on mpox, in an interview from Kinshasa. “If these newly described outbreaks of sexually transmitted infection are not controlled at the source, the virus may circulate more widely in the same manner as clade 2 is circulating.”So far, there’s no evidence sexual transmission of the clade 1 outbreak has spilled outside of Congo. But Lewis cautioned that bordering countries are at risk because of the high mobility of sex workers who are contracting the virus.In its alert, the CDC said none of the 150 U.S. mpox cases sampled this year for deeper testing belonged to clade 1.The CDC declined repeated requests for an interview but issued a statement saying that “the anticipated risk to the United States is low” and would be primarily among those who traveled to Congo. Those who did and develop new or unexplained rashes should immediately seek medical care and tell their doctor they were recently in Congo, officials said.Disease detectives traced a cluster of sexually transmitted clade 1 mpox cases in Congo to a man who probably contracted the virus in Europe after having sex with someone who frequently visits Congo. The man then traveled to Congo, and three of his sexual partners there, including one woman, later tested positive for mpox, according to research published last week in the CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. He had also visited gay sex clubs, and some members of sex clubs in Congo also frequent clubs elsewhere in central Africa and in Europe, raising concerns of international spread.But there’s no evidence that happened, and this particular chain of transmission appears to have been broken, though health officials caution there may be other cases of sexual spread going unnoticed.The international health community had taken little notice of a 2019 report documenting unusual sexual transmission of mpox in Nigeria, and three years later was surprised by the rapid global sexual spread of the once-rare virus.Researchers say the world has an opportunity to support vaccination in central Africa to prevent another global outbreak that could be deadlier. The fatality rate in Congo from mpox overall has been 5 percent this year, though death rates are usually lower in countries with better access to health care.Some experts say it’s galling that the Jynneos vaccine for mpox is now widely available in the United States — where cases have dwindled to several a week — but not in Congo or other nations where the virus is endemic. The Biden administration had to scramble last year to increase vaccine supply.“We are just simply witnessing a double standard,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health and member of the International Mpox Research Consortium.Bavarian Nordic, which manufactures the Jynneos vaccine, said it has not been approached by African nations seeking vaccines in the last two years and has encountered regulatory hurdles in donating it.“Bavarian Nordic is willing to support the current situation in the DRC and monitoring it closely,” chief executive Paul Chaplin said in a statement. “JYNNEOS is not approved in the DRC, or any other country in Africa, so the issue of liability/indemnification has to be resolved whether doses are sold or donated.”Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist who has studied mpox in Congo for two decades, said even if the two-dose vaccine were approved, distribution would be “exponentially complicated” in a poorly resourced country with competing public health priorities and logistical challenges in bringing shots to rural areas. She also said people who belong to highly stigmatized groups at greater risk of contracting the virus can be harder to reach and may not feel comfortable accessing medical care.“It’s not just as simple as handing over vaccine and saying have at it,” said Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.The confirmation of male-to-male sexual spread in Congo also exacerbates stigma concerns.Health officials had tread carefully last year when acknowledging mpox cases outside of endemic countries were overwhelmingly in gay and bisexual men. That can be especially difficult in parts of Africa where homosexuality is taboo or even criminalized. Same-sex relations are not illegal in Congo, but the prevalence of underground sex clubs illustrates how homosexuality is frowned upon. Experts worry people may not seek treatment when they have genital lesions.“It becomes almost a scarlet letter,” said Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, a physician who has treated mpox patients in Atlanta and trained in Cameroon, where mpox is endemic. “It’s very difficult to provide care or efforts for prevention when you have to thread the needle from protecting communities that can be vulnerable targets and getting the education and testing resources that are needed by these communities.”Experts also warned against drawing simplistic comparisons between Africa and the West when it comes to bigotry. Homophobia also complicated the mpox response in the United States, where some people were hesitant to disclose sexual history to get vaccinated or worried about developing a telltale mark on their arm from a shot associated with gay men.While the worst days of the mpox outbreak in the United States are over, peaking at nearly 450 daily infections in August 2022, the country still sees sporadic cases, including 28 in November.",9441,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/12/06/mpox-monkeypox-congo-who-vaccines/,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Health | Science | Technology,https://tse3.explicit.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cysHEGJuAL_FgzGaxQpl1QHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country vulnerable contaminate raise available dozen mpox increase broken response sample treatment november record hesitant rash back unconnected manner public resolve threat request tension worry suggests unusual patient sporadic develop version expert kinshasa fielding drive toll exponentially illegal large described thread caught doctor yale warn draw similar interview vaccinate lewis emerge vaccine happen fatality attune africa disease effort caution homosexuality rural underscore poor difficult exacerbates cdc struggle start relation detective alert drc peak day unfold donate study decade democratic release frequent learn overwhelmingly extent executive african simple suspect school reach travel renew resource wednesday emergency province jason pose story worried global positive biden train partner comparison evidence contact equity accord warning august manitoba frown event outbreak tread broadly probably bavarian particular witness capital prevent worker nation nigeria eastern paul lookout bigotry bite history region scientist widespread medicine broader genital current boghuma anticipate significant closely resourced telltale infect university west circulate underground spread form international relieve untreated simply chaplin test epidemiology anne confirm border center sexual jynneos rosamund gregg link bring year immediately publish rady quell declare prevalence acknowledge stigma member comfortable cluster report driven typically chain ucla illustrates official atlanta homophobia belong dwindle worldwide visit central rate hurdle associate double repeat case deadlier nordic encounter kabisen cameroon surge provider europe rimoin chief manufacture trace fail hand mobility sell college administration internationally professor tally inhabit concern contract opportunity medical access poorly logistical carefully united festival transmission unexplained situation gonsalves discovery disclose recently mark transmit support regulatory previous education surprised virus bordering question compete physician part kindrachuk vaccination efficient death group complicate research congo highly ignite journal rapid lead week clade state consequence approve risk priority criminalize place nonsexual seek low max identify sexually control challenge decline prevention animal high feel scramble endemic infectious simplistic scarlet affect deeper protect include inhibit bushmeat gay epidemiologist percent document republic hiv taboo primarily scratch attention previously recognize titanji world prove severe woman account widely health notice technical bisexual involve club time needle thursday gall statement issue detail distribution contain especially microbiology authority shot target newly potentially standard provide letter frequently unclear stigmatize daily urban confirmation treat sex harder arm spill source monitoring approach infection consume prompt great community organization area,-0.95025,0.1588814744200826,11.93867149758454,0.38460490620490634,0
New York Times,"Israel-Hamas WarRelief Effort Falters in Southern Gaza, U.N. Says",2023-12-08 02:42:00,"Victoria Kim, Gaya Gupta, Isabel Kershner, Aaron Boxerman, Talya Minsberg, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, The New York Times","Israel says hundreds of suspects, including Hamas fighters, surrendered across the Gaza Strip.Israel announces limited steps aimed at easing Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.In Israel, Hanukkah begins in the shadow of two months of war.Here are some key moments in two months of war.Relief workers in southern Gaza on Friday were awaiting additional fuel deliveries and the opening of a second border inspection point for shipments of critical supplies, after a dire warning from a top U.N. humanitarian official that intensified fighting had all but incapacitated aid operations.Southern Gaza had been the “cornerstone” for the distribution of much-needed food, water and medicine to civilians facing dire shortages, said Martin Griffiths, the United Nations’ chief humanitarian official. With Israel dialing up airstrikes and ground operations in the south in recent days, and roads increasingly mined or destroyed, relief efforts have become erratic and undependable, he said at a news briefing in Geneva.“We do not have a humanitarian operation in southern Gaza that can be called by that name anymore,” he said. “Without places of safety, that plan is in tatters.”Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Thursday said Israel needed to do more to lessen the harm to Gaza’s civilians. “It is imperative, it remains imperative, that Israel put a premium on civilian protection,” Mr. Blinken said. “And there does remain a gap between exactly what I said when I was there, the intent to protect civilians, and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Thursday that the Israeli government would allow a “minimal” supply of additional fuel “to prevent a humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics” without specifying when it would be delivered. Col. Elad Goren, an Israeli military official, told reporters on Thursday that Israel was discussing the quantity of the supply with U.N. agencies, but that it needed a “mechanism” to ensure the fuel wouldn’t go to Hamas.Israel has severely restricted the flow of fuel into Gaza for fear it would be diverted for military use by Hamas, the armed group that controls the strip and staged the Oct. 7 attacks. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Thursday that its ambulance center in northern Gaza had been forced to stop transporting the injured because of a lack of fuel.Since the fighting resumed a week ago after a brief cease-fire, Israel’s airstrikes and ground operations have expanded to the southern half of Gaza, again displacing the many civilians who had been sheltering there after fleeing the north in the early days of the war.Even in southern Gaza, where there has been more access to relief supplies than in the north during the war, more than eight out of 10 households are taking extreme measures to cope with food shortages, the World Food Program said in an assessment this week that was based on a survey carried out during the pause in fighting. In the northern half of the enclave, 97 percent of households are taking such steps, according to the report.Israel also said on Thursday that it would “in the next few days” open a second inspection point along Gaza’s southern border, at Kerem Shalom, to speed up the flow of critical supplies into the strip.Mr. Griffiths welcomed the decision, saying that the additional inspection point “will be a huge boost to the logistical process.” But he added that the fighting inside Gaza would continue to hamper humanitarian operations.Edward Wong contributed reporting.— Victoria KimThe first time she and her family had to move was in the early days of the war, when they fled their home in Gaza City.Ola Abu Hasaballah, 35, recalled leaving home, under relentless bombing, with her husband, her 4-month-old baby and her 5-year-old son. Describing the night as a catastrophe, she said she thought they’d be gone for a day, maybe two.It’s been nearly two months since that night. And on Monday, she moved for the seventh time in her search for a safe haven — this time to the town of Rafah on the Egyptian border from the city of Khan Younis farther north.Ms. Hasaballah described the dismal conditions she and many other displaced Palestinians are facing in Rafah, where the Israeli military has directed civilians to go. Explosions leave her and others in constant terror, while meager portions and crowded lines for food fill her with a sense of desperation.“The food and water are very rare here,” she said in a WhatsApp message. “I spent all day with a small piece of bread, and that’s it.”She said that she had waited this morning for six hours in a crowded line to get food, starting at 7 a.m. Many people were sleeping in line, she said.She sent a picture of what her family of four had been given to eat for the next three days. One plastic bottle of water, a can of beans and a small can of tinned meat.The United Nations said that Rafah has been the only place in Gaza to receive any humanitarian aid in nearly a week. Tens of thousands of people have fled there in recent days, and the city is overflowing with displaced Palestinians, forcing many to sleep on the street.After the collapse of a seven-day truce last week, the Israeli military directed civilians in Khan Younis, where many Palestinians had sought refuge in the beginning of the war, to move farther south to Rafah.Israeli airstrikes have nonetheless hit Rafah. Ms. Hasaballah said she has heard explosions since Wednesday night, and she fears for her two young children. “I am doing my best to keep them safe,” she said.Another woman, Heba Usrof, 29, who also fled Khan Younis to take shelter in a refugee camp in Rafah, said she heard several big explosions during the day on Thursday.“Today is more difficult than the previous days in Rafah,” she said. “However, the worst day for me here was the day the ground operations started on Khan Younis. Too many big explosions and strikes.”Abu Bakr Bashir contributed reporting.— Gaya GuptaAdvertisementThe Israeli military said on Thursday that it had apprehended hundreds of people suspected of terrorism, including wanted Hamas operatives, across the Gaza Strip in a single day, and that many had surrendered and been transferred to Israel for further questioning.Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, said in a televised briefing that many of the suspects under interrogation by the military and the Shin Bet domestic security agency had turned themselves over to the Israeli forces.“The intelligence we gather from the questioning aids us in the continued fight,” he said.The announcements of the surrenders and arrests came soon after photographs and videos surfaced on social media appearing to show rows of men stripped to their underwear, sitting or kneeling on the ground, with some bound and blindfolded.The New York Times has not verified the images or the video. Admiral Hagari did not answer directly when asked about the images, but reiterated the Israeli military’s goal of finding and capturing Hamas operatives.“They hide under the ground and come out and we battle them,” Admiral Hagari said. Some, he added, “come out of tunnel shafts and others out of houses. We question and investigate who among them is connected to Hamas and who is not. We detain all of them and interrogate them.”Another military spokesman, Maj. Nir Dinar, said the military had not released the images and did not know when, or if, Israeli soldiers had taken them.The Israeli military said in a statement that troops had arrested hundreds of people suspected of involvement in terrorism over the past day, during combat in Shejaiya and Jabaliya, Hamas strongholds in the northern Gaza Strip, and Khan Younis, another Hamas bastion in the south of the Palestinian enclave.In addition, the military said, an army intelligence unit and the Shin Bet worked together on Thursday to arrest another 150 terrorism suspects, including Hamas operatives, from the area of the Jabaliya refugee camp, and that they were being questioned in Gaza. The military had previously stated that its human intelligence unit was operating an interrogation facility inside Gaza.Since beginning its ground invasion of Gaza in late October, Israel has arrested hundreds of Palestinians, among them the director of Al-Shifa Hospital, the strip’s largest medical facility. Israel has contended that Hamas was using the hospital as a command-and-control center. The military has exposed a stretch of tunnel running under the hospital compound.Admiral Hagari added that Israeli forces were advancing on Thursday and intensifying the battle against Hamas’s strongholds in northern and southern Gaza, killing senior commanders hiding in underground tunnels and destroying Hamas infrastructure.The military said on Thursday that it killed a senior Hamas operative in an airstrike a few days ago that hit Hamas’s central intelligence command center. The operative, it said, is Abdel Aziz Rantisi, from Hamas’ military intelligence unit, who the military said had been responsible for field intelligence in the strip and helped to plan the Oct. 7 assault in southern Israel.Over the last few days, the military said, its forces have been fighting in close-quarter combat, killing “dozens” of armed operatives, and have located and destroyed weapons and underground infrastructure, “predominantly located inside and in the vicinity of civilian buildings,” as well as rocket launchers and tunnel shafts, including one inside a school in Shejaiya.It was not possible to independently verify Israel’s account of the fighting.Also on Thursday, an anti-tank missile that was fired into northern Israel from Lebanese territory killed an Israeli civilian. Israel said it responded to that strike and additional launches from Lebanon with tank and artillery fire, and airstrikes against targets including what the military described as a command-and-control center of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite organization.— Isabel Kershner reporting from JerusalemAmid a growing outcry over the worsening conditions for civilians in Gaza, Israel announced steps on Thursday to ease the humanitarian crisis, saying it would allow some more fuel into the enclave and would add a second inspection point for trucks carrying relief supplies.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli government had decided to allow “a minimal supplement of fuel” into southern Gaza in order “to prevent a humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics.” It did not specify how much fuel that would be, or when the supplies would be allowed in.“The amount of fuel is something we are assessing with the U.N. agencies,” Col. Elad Goren, an Israeli military official, told reporters on Thursday. He said that Israel would adjust the volume of supplies based on needs in Gaza, as long as “there is a full mechanism that we trust that this fuel is not going to Hamas.”Colonel Goren also said that “in the next few days,” Israel would open a second point to inspect international aid destined for Gaza, at Kerem Shalom, an Israeli community near the southernmost tip of Gaza, to facilitate the entry of additional assistance.Martin Griffiths, the chief humanitarian official at the United Nations, said that negotiations underway to open a second inspection site would be “a huge boost” for humanitarian aid deliveries. But he added that Israel’s military assault on Gaza has left international efforts to provide that aid in tatters.“We do not have a humanitarian operation in southern Gaza that can be called by that name any more,” he said.Israel’s announcement came as Palestinians in southern Gaza endured catastrophic conditions, with nearly nine weeks of Israeli bombardment driving nearly 1.9 million people to flee their homes, by aid agencies’ estimates, amid severe shortages of food and clean water.Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel triggered all-out war, Israel has sharply restricted the flow of supplies, including fuel, into Gaza, and has insisted on inspecting trucks carrying aid into Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Israel says the measures are essential to bar the entry of supplies that Hamas could divert for military use.Kerem Shalom, in Israel, is much closer to Rafah than the lone site where Israel has conducted the inspections until now — Nitzana, which is roughly 46 kilometers, or 29 miles, south of Rafah. Some international aid groups say that the process of sending trucks full of supplies to Nitzana and back has caused further delays in essential supplies reaching Gazan civilians.Israel has denied that its procedures are causing a bottleneck, saying it can inspect up to 250 trucks a day at Nitzana.“The problem is not Nitzana,” Colonel Goren said on Thursday. “The problem is the capability of the U.N. agencies to collect all the international assistance that, after we check it, goes to Rafah.”On Thursday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said relief efforts in Gaza had been severely impeded over the past few days because of shortages of trucks, telecommunications blackouts and fighting.“The conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist,” Lynn Hastings, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said this week. “If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond.”Kerem Shalom was the main commercial crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip before the war. It regularly saw hundreds of truckloads of imports and exports pass between the two sides daily.The Israeli government has ruled out reopening Kerem Shalom for shipments into Gaza, meaning that all supplies for now pass through Rafah.Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting.— Aaron Boxerman reporting from JerusalemAdvertisementIsraelis gathered again on Thursday evening in the Tel Aviv square where for two months protesters have called for the release of hostages in Gaza, but this time they came to mark the start of Hanukkah.Holding signs that bore the faces of the 138 people still held hostage and wearing T-shirts, necklaces and yellow bracelets that demanded “bring them home now,” the attendees said this year’s Hanukkah was not a holiday to stay home, but one to gather and support one another.“Perhaps there’s something in the power of getting together,” Julia Ferment said. “Perhaps some of this energy, this strength, gets to them.”Relatives of hostages, groups of friends and soldiers huddled quietly close to a long table with 138 candles, one for each missing loved one. Family members and friends were invited to light the yellow candles. Afterward they were embraced as they moved to the front of the crowd.The Hanukkah blessings, which in Jewish tradition are repeated on eight nights, held a new meaning for the hundreds that sang along, some with tears in their eyes, some with their eyes sealed shut, hands on heart.A few miles south in Ramla, another group of Israelis gathered to mark the beginning of the holiday at an army base. The reservists, many with graying hair and families back home, delighted to find traditional Hanukkah pastries — jelly doughnuts called sufganiyot — waiting for them when they walked into the warehouse for dinner. Another reservist had just proudly sprinkled powder sugar on top of the pastries.Rabbi Arie Levin, a father of 11 who usually works in Tel Aviv, gathered the group around the table holding the doughnuts and a menorah. There’s a lot of darkness, he said, then pointed at the menorah, and here’s a little light. He lit a candle.It was the third time he had lit a menorah that night. He had already done candles with another group of soldiers on the other side of the base and with a group of people who were living in a Tel Aviv hotel, displaced from their homes in the north and the south of Israel. Soon, he would leave the army base to travel back home and join the families of hostages for another candle lighting at a synagogue.When the menorah was lit in Ramla, the soldiers danced to a traditional Hanukkah song. In Tel Aviv, the air was still when the candles were aflame. Almost immediately, a voice in the back of the crowd started the chant that has echoed in this square for more than 60 days.“Now, now, now, now,” the people said.— Talya MinsbergTwo months ago, on Oct. 7, Hamas and other militant groups based in Gaza launched a cross-border attack in Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel launched a military campaign to eradicate Hamas that has devastated Gaza, with the Gazan health authorities saying that more than 15,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children. Israel’s military estimates that it has killed several thousand Hamas fighters.Here is a timeline of some key events in the war:Oct. 7: Hamas and other militant groups fire thousands of rockets into Israel and gunmen infiltrate border communities, army bases and an outdoor music festival, killing hundreds and abducting about 240 people. It is the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding. Israeli authorities have said they are investigating reports that the attackers committed widespread sexual violence.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says in a televised statement that the country is “at war,” and he calls up thousands of military reservists.Oct. 9: Israel orders a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip, saying that “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” will be allowed into the enclave. Its military pounds Gaza with airstrikes amid signs that it is preparing for a ground invasion.Oct. 10: Israeli troops mostly retake control of towns near the Gaza Strip from Palestinian gunmen.Oct. 11: Mr. Netanyahu forms an emergency government, adding two opposition lawmakers, both former army chiefs, to his cabinet.Oct. 13: Israel’s military orders civilians to evacuate northern Gaza, sparking panic and chaos as thousands move south.Oct. 17: An explosion outside the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City kills and wounds many people. Palestinian officials blame an Israeli strike. Israeli and American intelligence agencies say that a failed Palestinian rocket launch caused the explosion.Oct. 18: President Biden visits Israel, where he embraces Mr. Netanyahu and says in a speech that he understands Israel’s “all-consuming rage.” He also warns Israeli leaders about what he says were mistakes the United States made after the 9/11 attacks.Oct. 20: Hamas releases two American hostages held in Gaza, Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, after negotiations involving officials in Qatar. Days later, it releases two more hostages, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and, Nurit Cooper, 79.Oct. 27: Amid heavy airstrikes, and shrouded in secrecy and ambiguity, Israel launches a ground invasion into north Gaza from three directions. Cellphone and internet service in the enclave is cut off.Oct. 31: Israel’s military strikes the Jabaliya neighborhood north of Gaza City with two 2,000-pound bombs, killing dozens of people and wounding hundreds, according to Gazan health officials. Israel says it was targeting a Hamas commander.Nov. 6: Israel’s military says it has effectively surrounded Gaza City and split Gaza into north and south.Nov. 15: Israel’s military storms Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which it says doubles as a Hamas military command center, an allegation that Hamas denies. Israel later says it discovered weapons and other evidence that supports its assertions that Hamas operated in a network of tunnels under the complex.Nov. 24: Israel and Hamas pause fighting in a deal that allows for the release of 102 hostages and for more than 200 Palestinians held in Israeli jails over the course of several days. It also allows for the delivery of more aid to Gaza’s civilians.Dec. 2: The truce collapses. The Israeli military heavily bombards southern Gaza, claiming to strike more than 400 targets, and orders residents to evacuate several towns and villages, spreading confusion and fear as people sought shelter.Dec. 5: The Israeli military describes house-to-house gun battles with Hamas fighters in the southern city of Khan Younis. Civilians and aid workers describe some of the heaviest bombardment of the conflict and deteriorating humanitarian conditions.— Matthew Mpoke BiggAdvertisementReporting inside Gaza is extremely challenging right now. Israel has prevented journalists from entering the region except when accompanied by its military, and then only under certain conditions, while Egypt, along its border, is also blocking access. Communications have been limited, in part because of the Israeli siege of the enclave. Many Palestinian journalists in Gaza have been killed in airstrikes. And even before the war, Hamas restricted what reporters could cover in Gaza, limiting their movement, interrogating their sources and translators and expelling foreign reporters for work deemed objectionable.The Times, along with other news organizations, has asked the governments of Israel and Egypt for direct access to Gaza because reporting on the ground is vital to understanding this crisis. Throughout the war, The Times has been working with journalists who were already in Gaza when the siege began. We have been interviewing residents and officials in Gaza by phone and using digital apps. We have asked people in the area to share their stories with us on video, which we then confirm are real. We also verify photos and social media posts using similar techniques, scrutinizing them to determine where and when they were taken or written and cross-checking with other sources, such as satellite imagery. We cross reference any information we gather with interviews with the U.N. and other international organizations, many of which have employees in different parts of Gaza.In general, we try to avoid

All three said they had taken action against antisemitism, but critics argued they had not done enough or were even fostering antisemitism on their campuses.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Alan Blinder is a national correspondent for The Times, covering education.

New York Times,Hunter Biden Charged With Evading Taxes on Millions From Foreign Firms,2023-12-07 00:00:00,"Glenn Thrush, Michael S. Schmidt","Reporting from WashingtonA federal grand jury charged Hunter Biden on Thursday with a scheme to evade federal taxes on millions in income from foreign businesses, the second indictment against him this year and a major new development in a case Republicans have made the cornerstone of a possible impeachment of President Biden.Mr. Biden, the president’s son, faces three counts each of evasion of a tax assessment, failure to file and pay taxes, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return, according to the 56-page indictment — a withering play-by-play of personal indulgence with potentially enormous political costs for his father.The charges, filed in California, came five months after he appeared to be on the verge of a plea deal that would have avoided jail time and potentially granted him broad immunity from future prosecution stemming from his business dealings. But the agreement collapsed, and in September, he was indicted in Delaware on three charges stemming from his illegal purchase of a handgun in 2018, a period when he used drugs heavily and was prohibited from owning a firearm.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Glenn Thrush covers the Department of Justice.

New York Times,"Israel-Hamas WarRelief Effort Falters in Southern Gaza, U.N. Says",2023-12-08 02:42:00,"Victoria Kim, Gaya Gupta, Isabel Kershner, Aaron Boxerman, Talya Minsberg, Matthew Mpoke Bigg, The New York Times","Israel says hundreds of suspects, including Hamas fighters, surrendered across the Gaza Strip.Israel announces limited steps aimed at easing Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.In Israel, Hanukkah begins in the shadow of two months of war.Here are some key moments in two months of war.Relief workers in southern Gaza on Friday were awaiting additional fuel deliveries and the opening of a second border inspection point for shipments of critical supplies, after a dire warning from a top U.N. humanitarian official that intensified fighting had all but incapacitated aid operations.Southern Gaza had been the “cornerstone” for the distribution of much-needed food, water and medicine to civilians facing dire shortages, said Martin Griffiths, the United Nations’ chief humanitarian official. With Israel dialing up airstrikes and ground operations in the south in recent days, and roads increasingly mined or destroyed, relief efforts have become erratic and undependable, he said at a news briefing in Geneva.“We do not have a humanitarian operation in southern Gaza that can be called by that name anymore,” he said. “Without places of safety, that plan is in tatters.”Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Thursday said Israel needed to do more to lessen the harm to Gaza’s civilians. “It is imperative, it remains imperative, that Israel put a premium on civilian protection,” Mr. Blinken said. “And there does remain a gap between exactly what I said when I was there, the intent to protect civilians, and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Thursday that the Israeli government would allow a “minimal” supply of additional fuel “to prevent a humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics” without specifying when it would be delivered. Col. Elad Goren, an Israeli military official, told reporters on Thursday that Israel was discussing the quantity of the supply with U.N. agencies, but that it needed a “mechanism” to ensure the fuel wouldn’t go to Hamas.Israel has severely restricted the flow of fuel into Gaza for fear it would be diverted for military use by Hamas, the armed group that controls the strip and staged the Oct. 7 attacks. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Thursday that its ambulance center in northern Gaza had been forced to stop transporting the injured because of a lack of fuel.Since the fighting resumed a week ago after a brief cease-fire, Israel’s airstrikes and ground operations have expanded to the southern half of Gaza, again displacing the many civilians who had been sheltering there after fleeing the north in the early days of the war.Even in southern Gaza, where there has been more access to relief supplies than in the north during the war, more than eight out of 10 households are taking extreme measures to cope with food shortages, the World Food Program said in an assessment this week that was based on a survey carried out during the pause in fighting. In the northern half of the enclave, 97 percent of households are taking such steps, according to the report.Israel also said on Thursday that it would “in the next few days” open a second inspection point along Gaza’s southern border, at Kerem Shalom, to speed up the flow of critical supplies into the strip.Mr. Griffiths welcomed the decision, saying that the additional inspection point “will be a huge boost to the logistical process.” But he added that the fighting inside Gaza would continue to hamper humanitarian operations.Edward Wong contributed reporting.— Victoria KimThe first time she and her family had to move was in the early days of the war, when they fled their home in Gaza City.Ola Abu Hasaballah, 35, recalled leaving home, under relentless bombing, with her husband, her 4-month-old baby and her 5-year-old son. Describing the night as a catastrophe, she said she thought they’d be gone for a day, maybe two.It’s been nearly two months since that night. And on Monday, she moved for the seventh time in her search for a safe haven — this time to the town of Rafah on the Egyptian border from the city of Khan Younis farther north.Ms. Hasaballah described the dismal conditions she and many other displaced Palestinians are facing in Rafah, where the Israeli military has directed civilians to go. Explosions leave her and others in constant terror, while meager portions and crowded lines for food fill her with a sense of desperation.“The food and water are very rare here,” she said in a WhatsApp message. “I spent all day with a small piece of bread, and that’s it.”She said that she had waited this morning for six hours in a crowded line to get food, starting at 7 a.m. Many people were sleeping in line, she said.She sent a picture of what her family of four had been given to eat for the next three days. One plastic bottle of water, a can of beans and a small can of tinned meat.The United Nations said that Rafah has been the only place in Gaza to receive any humanitarian aid in nearly a week. Tens of thousands of people have fled there in recent days, and the city is overflowing with displaced Palestinians, forcing many to sleep on the street.After the collapse of a seven-day truce last week, the Israeli military directed civilians in Khan Younis, where many Palestinians had sought refuge in the beginning of the war, to move farther south to Rafah.Israeli airstrikes have nonetheless hit Rafah. Ms. Hasaballah said she has heard explosions since Wednesday night, and she fears for her two young children. “I am doing my best to keep them safe,” she said.Another woman, Heba Usrof, 29, who also fled Khan Younis to take shelter in a refugee camp in Rafah, said she heard several big explosions during the day on Thursday.“Today is more difficult than the previous days in Rafah,” she said. “However, the worst day for me here was the day the ground operations started on Khan Younis. Too many big explosions and strikes.”Abu Bakr Bashir contributed reporting.— Gaya GuptaAdvertisementThe Israeli military said on Thursday that it had apprehended hundreds of people suspected of terrorism, including wanted Hamas operatives, across the Gaza Strip in a single day, and that many had surrendered and been transferred to Israel for further questioning.Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, said in a televised briefing that many of the suspects under interrogation by the military and the Shin Bet domestic security agency had turned themselves over to the Israeli forces.“The intelligence we gather from the questioning aids us in the continued fight,” he said.The announcements of the surrenders and arrests came soon after photographs and videos surfaced on social media appearing to show rows of men stripped to their underwear, sitting or kneeling on the ground, with some bound and blindfolded.The New York Times has not verified the images or the video. Admiral Hagari did not answer directly when asked about the images, but reiterated the Israeli military’s goal of finding and capturing Hamas operatives.“They hide under the ground and come out and we battle them,” Admiral Hagari said. Some, he added, “come out of tunnel shafts and others out of houses. We question and investigate who among them is connected to Hamas and who is not. We detain all of them and interrogate them.”Another military spokesman, Maj. Nir Dinar, said the military had not released the images and did not know when, or if, Israeli soldiers had taken them.The Israeli military said in a statement that troops had arrested hundreds of people suspected of involvement in terrorism over the past day, during combat in Shejaiya and Jabaliya, Hamas strongholds in the northern Gaza Strip, and Khan Younis, another Hamas bastion in the south of the Palestinian enclave.In addition, the military said, an army intelligence unit and the Shin Bet worked together on Thursday to arrest another 150 terrorism suspects, including Hamas operatives, from the area of the Jabaliya refugee camp, and that they were being questioned in Gaza. The military had previously stated that its human intelligence unit was operating an interrogation facility inside Gaza.Since beginning its ground invasion of Gaza in late October, Israel has arrested hundreds of Palestinians, among them the director of Al-Shifa Hospital, the strip’s largest medical facility. Israel has contended that Hamas was using the hospital as a command-and-control center. The military has exposed a stretch of tunnel running under the hospital compound.Admiral Hagari added that Israeli forces were advancing on Thursday and intensifying the battle against Hamas’s strongholds in northern and southern Gaza, killing senior commanders hiding in underground tunnels and destroying Hamas infrastructure.The military said on Thursday that it killed a senior Hamas operative in an airstrike a few days ago that hit Hamas’s central intelligence command center. The operative, it said, is Abdel Aziz Rantisi, from Hamas’ military intelligence unit, who the military said had been responsible for field intelligence in the strip and helped to plan the Oct. 7 assault in southern Israel.Over the last few days, the military said, its forces have been fighting in close-quarter combat, killing “dozens” of armed operatives, and have located and destroyed weapons and underground infrastructure, “predominantly located inside and in the vicinity of civilian buildings,” as well as rocket launchers and tunnel shafts, including one inside a school in Shejaiya.It was not possible to independently verify Israel’s account of the fighting.Also on Thursday, an anti-tank missile that was fired into northern Israel from Lebanese territory killed an Israeli civilian. Israel said it responded to that strike and additional launches from Lebanon with tank and artillery fire, and airstrikes against targets including what the military described as a command-and-control center of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite organization.— Isabel Kershner reporting from JerusalemAmid a growing outcry over the worsening conditions for civilians in Gaza, Israel announced steps on Thursday to ease the humanitarian crisis, saying it would allow some more fuel into the enclave and would add a second inspection point for trucks carrying relief supplies.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli government had decided to allow “a minimal supplement of fuel” into southern Gaza in order “to prevent a humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics.” It did not specify how much fuel that would be, or when the supplies would be allowed in.“The amount of fuel is something we are assessing with the U.N. agencies,” Col. Elad Goren, an Israeli military official, told reporters on Thursday. He said that Israel would adjust the volume of supplies based on needs in Gaza, as long as “there is a full mechanism that we trust that this fuel is not going to Hamas.”Colonel Goren also said that “in the next few days,” Israel would open a second point to inspect international aid destined for Gaza, at Kerem Shalom, an Israeli community near the southernmost tip of Gaza, to facilitate the entry of additional assistance.Martin Griffiths, the chief humanitarian official at the United Nations, said that negotiations underway to open a second inspection site would be “a huge boost” for humanitarian aid deliveries. But he added that Israel’s military assault on Gaza has left international efforts to provide that aid in tatters.“We do not have a humanitarian operation in southern Gaza that can be called by that name any more,” he said.Israel’s announcement came as Palestinians in southern Gaza endured catastrophic conditions, with nearly nine weeks of Israeli bombardment driving nearly 1.9 million people to flee their homes, by aid agencies’ estimates, amid severe shortages of food and clean water.Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel triggered all-out war, Israel has sharply restricted the flow of supplies, including fuel, into Gaza, and has insisted on inspecting trucks carrying aid into Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Israel says the measures are essential to bar the entry of supplies that Hamas could divert for military use.Kerem Shalom, in Israel, is much closer to Rafah than the lone site where Israel has conducted the inspections until now — Nitzana, which is roughly 46 kilometers, or 29 miles, south of Rafah. Some international aid groups say that the process of sending trucks full of supplies to Nitzana and back has caused further delays in essential supplies reaching Gazan civilians.Israel has denied that its procedures are causing a bottleneck, saying it can inspect up to 250 trucks a day at Nitzana.“The problem is not Nitzana,” Colonel Goren said on Thursday. “The problem is the capability of the U.N. agencies to collect all the international assistance that, after we check it, goes to Rafah.”On Thursday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said relief efforts in Gaza had been severely impeded over the past few days because of shortages of trucks, telecommunications blackouts and fighting.“The conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist,” Lynn Hastings, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said this week. “If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond.”Kerem Shalom was the main commercial crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip before the war. It regularly saw hundreds of truckloads of imports and exports pass between the two sides daily.The Israeli government has ruled out reopening Kerem Shalom for shipments into Gaza, meaning that all supplies for now pass through Rafah.Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting.— Aaron Boxerman reporting from JerusalemAdvertisementIsraelis gathered again on Thursday evening in the Tel Aviv square where for two months protesters have called for the release of hostages in Gaza, but this time they came to mark the start of Hanukkah.Holding signs that bore the faces of the 138 people still held hostage and wearing T-shirts, necklaces and yellow bracelets that demanded “bring them home now,” the attendees said this year’s Hanukkah was not a holiday to stay home, but one to gather and support one another.“Perhaps there’s something in the power of getting together,” Julia Ferment said. “Perhaps some of this energy, this strength, gets to them.”Relatives of hostages, groups of friends and soldiers huddled quietly close to a long table with 138 candles, one for each missing loved one. Family members and friends were invited to light the yellow candles. Afterward they were embraced as they moved to the front of the crowd.The Hanukkah blessings, which in Jewish tradition are repeated on eight nights, held a new meaning for the hundreds that sang along, some with tears in their eyes, some with their eyes sealed shut, hands on heart.A few miles south in Ramla, another group of Israelis gathered to mark the beginning of the holiday at an army base. The reservists, many with graying hair and families back home, delighted to find traditional Hanukkah pastries — jelly doughnuts called sufganiyot — waiting for them when they walked into the warehouse for dinner. Another reservist had just proudly sprinkled powder sugar on top of the pastries.Rabbi Arie Levin, a father of 11 who usually works in Tel Aviv, gathered the group around the table holding the doughnuts and a menorah. There’s a lot of darkness, he said, then pointed at the menorah, and here’s a little light. He lit a candle.It was the third time he had lit a menorah that night. He had already done candles with another group of soldiers on the other side of the base and with a group of people who were living in a Tel Aviv hotel, displaced from their homes in the north and the south of Israel. Soon, he would leave the army base to travel back home and join the families of hostages for another candle lighting at a synagogue.When the menorah was lit in Ramla, the soldiers danced to a traditional Hanukkah song. In Tel Aviv, the air was still when the candles were aflame. Almost immediately, a voice in the back of the crowd started the chant that has echoed in this square for more than 60 days.“Now, now, now, now,” the people said.— Talya MinsbergTwo months ago, on Oct. 7, Hamas and other militant groups based in Gaza launched a cross-border attack in Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel launched a military campaign to eradicate Hamas that has devastated Gaza, with the Gazan health authorities saying that more than 15,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children. Israel’s military estimates that it has killed several thousand Hamas fighters.Here is a timeline of some key events in the war:Oct. 7: Hamas and other militant groups fire thousands of rockets into Israel and gunmen infiltrate border communities, army bases and an outdoor music festival, killing hundreds and abducting about 240 people. It is the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding. Israeli authorities have said they are investigating reports that the attackers committed widespread sexual violence.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says in a televised statement that the country is “at war,” and he calls up thousands of military reservists.Oct. 9: Israel orders a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip, saying that “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” will be allowed into the enclave. Its military pounds Gaza with airstrikes amid signs that it is preparing for a ground invasion.Oct. 10: Israeli troops mostly retake control of towns near the Gaza Strip from Palestinian gunmen.Oct. 11: Mr. Netanyahu forms an emergency government, adding two opposition lawmakers, both former army chiefs, to his cabinet.Oct. 13: Israel’s military orders civilians to evacuate northern Gaza, sparking panic and chaos as thousands move south.Oct. 17: An explosion outside the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City kills and wounds many people. Palestinian officials blame an Israeli strike. Israeli and American intelligence agencies say that a failed Palestinian rocket launch caused the explosion.Oct. 18: President Biden visits Israel, where he embraces Mr. Netanyahu and says in a speech that he understands Israel’s “all-consuming rage.” He also warns Israeli leaders about what he says were mistakes the United States made after the 9/11 attacks.Oct. 20: Hamas releases two American hostages held in Gaza, Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, after negotiations involving officials in Qatar. Days later, it releases two more hostages, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and, Nurit Cooper, 79.Oct. 27: Amid heavy airstrikes, and shrouded in secrecy and ambiguity, Israel launches a ground invasion into north Gaza from three directions. Cellphone and internet service in the enclave is cut off.Oct. 31: Israel’s military strikes the Jabaliya neighborhood north of Gaza City with two 2,000-pound bombs, killing dozens of people and wounding hundreds, according to Gazan health officials. Israel says it was targeting a Hamas commander.Nov. 6: Israel’s military says it has effectively surrounded Gaza City and split Gaza into north and south.Nov. 15: Israel’s military storms Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which it says doubles as a Hamas military command center, an allegation that Hamas denies. Israel later says it discovered weapons and other evidence that supports its assertions that Hamas operated in a network of tunnels under the complex.Nov. 24: Israel and Hamas pause fighting in a deal that allows for the release of 102 hostages and for more than 200 Palestinians held in Israeli jails over the course of several days. It also allows for the delivery of more aid to Gaza’s civilians.Dec. 2: The truce collapses. The Israeli military heavily bombards southern Gaza, claiming to strike more than 400 targets, and orders residents to evacuate several towns and villages, spreading confusion and fear as people sought shelter.Dec. 5: The Israeli military describes house-to-house gun battles with Hamas fighters in the southern city of Khan Younis. Civilians and aid workers describe some of the heaviest bombardment of the conflict and deteriorating humanitarian conditions.— Matthew Mpoke BiggAdvertisementReporting inside Gaza is extremely challenging right now. Israel has prevented journalists from entering the region except when accompanied by its military, and then only under certain conditions, while Egypt, along its border, is also blocking access. Communications have been limited, in part because of the Israeli siege of the enclave. Many Palestinian journalists in Gaza have been killed in airstrikes. And even before the war, Hamas restricted what reporters could cover in Gaza, limiting their movement, interrogating their sources and translators and expelling foreign reporters for work deemed objectionable.The Times, along with other news organizations, has asked the governments of Israel and Egypt for direct access to Gaza because reporting on the ground is vital to understanding this crisis. Throughout the war, The Times has been working with journalists who were already in Gaza when the siege began. We have been interviewing residents and officials in Gaza by phone and using digital apps. We have asked people in the area to share their stories with us on video, which we then confirm are real. We also verify photos and social media posts using similar techniques, scrutinizing them to determine where and when they were taken or written and cross-checking with other sources, such as satellite imagery. We cross reference any information we gather with interviews with the U.N. and other international organizations, many of which have employees in different parts of Gaza.In general, we try to avoid relying on a single source and we seek to include detailed information whenever possible.— The New York

MSNBC,The final humiliation of Kevin McCarthy,2023-12-07 11:00:00,Hayes Brown,"The House of Representatives won’t have Kevin Owen McCarthy to kick around anymore. The eight-term Republican congressman from California announced on Wednesday that he would be stepping down from Congress, just over two months since his ouster after 10 months as speaker. Rather than finishing out his now-final term, McCarthy said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, he will be leaving before the end of the year. I can’t say that I’m surprised that this is the path McCarthy is taking. His 16 years in office, almost all in conference leadership, have been almost solely defined by his opportunism. It was clear after last fall’s midterms that his future in the House was reliant upon a razor-thin majority; his eventual downfall was all but predestined. But rather than continue to serve the people of Bakersfield, California, or work to counter the far-right members who toppled him, he has opted to chase power elsewhere. It is the choice of a coward. The op-ed is also oddly self-congratulatory for someone leaving office with no real victories to his name. McCarthy’s op-ed declaring that he will leave office to “serve America in new ways” is a perfect distillation of his congressional ethos: paragraphs of pablum with no substance. The closest thing to a thesis one can draw from the piece is that Congress is pointless, so his failures don’t really matter. “It often seems that the more Washington does, the worse America gets,” he writes, adding that the “challenges we face are more likely to be solved by innovation than legislation.” He doesn’t name these challenges, but he puts solving them squarely on the plate of “everyday men and women who are raising families, showing up for work, volunteering, and pursuing the American Dream with passion and purpose” rather than the officials they elected to handle it for them. The op-ed is also oddly self-congratulatory for someone leaving office with no real victories to his name. He patted himself on the back for shepherding Republican messaging bills about immigration and “parental rights” through his narrow majority. The two major bills he mentions that actually did become law — his deal with President Joe Biden to raise the debt ceiling and a short-term spending bill to avoid a shutdown — barely hit the lowest of bars (and both required mostly Democratic votes to pass). If this is the lie that McCarthy has to tell himself, that’s fine; it is an unconvincing rewriting of history and will do little to change the legacy he has crafted. He has been a poor steward of the people’s trust; rather than sever ties with former President Donald Trump in 2021, he rehabilitated the biggest threat facing American democracy. He has done nothing to leave Capitol Hill a better place than when he first arrived. If anything, McCarthy’s actions have left Congress weaker both in institutional power and in character. With his departure, he absolves himself of any responsibility to rein in the forces that he has helped unleash with his years of supplication to the far-right wing of his party. It is the latest ignoble end for a run of Republican speakers. I would be slightly less scathing toward McCarthy if he merely copied the Republican speaker before him, Wisconsin’s Paul Ryan, and announced that he wouldn’t seek another term in next year’s election. After all, it was already clear that McCarthy lacked the same kind of influence among the rank and file held by Democratic former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. With his influence collapsed and with no real interest in policymaking, there was little to tether him to office for the long term. It is the latest ignoble end for a run of Republican speakers. When former Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, abruptly resigned in 2015, McCarthy was the House majority leader, with an up-close look at the miscalculations and machinations that made his boss realize that he couldn’t control the tea party and the House Freedom Caucus. Rather than attempt to marginalize the far right, though, McCarthy chose appeasement, only lashing out in desperation when he was cornered. He lost, and lacking any remaining principles to fall back on, it sounds like, he intends to focus on the main talent he has honed over the years: raising money. But Boehner at least left Ryan in charge of a working majority. In choosing to leave early, McCarthy is making life much more difficult for his successor, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and yielding even more influence to the same agents of chaos that drove him from power. The short-term bill keeping the government open is set to expire in two phases, first in January and then in February. McCarthy’s exit comes on the heels of the expulsion of former Rep. George Santos of New York last week, and it may coincide with Rep. Bill Johnson of Ohio’s resignation to become president of Youngstown State University. With three empty seats, depending on absences across the aisle, the GOP may be able to lose only one vote without a bill failing. That doesn’t bode well for the plan to finish passing annual appropriations bills ahead of a potential rolling shutdown of the federal government. It also places more of a target on Johnson’s back should he once again need to rely on Democrats to save the day. But that won’t be McCarthy’s problem anymore — not that he ever really saw it as his. Congress was merely a place where Kevin McCarthy showed up to work in the hope of one day becoming manager. There is no courage required in that.

MSNBC,Who ‘won’ the fourth Republican presidential debate?,2023-12-07 04:24:00,Brian Tyler Cohen,"Former New Jersey Gov. and current chief Trump antagonist Chris Christie took his three fellow debaters to task Wednesday night with a succinct retort that cut through the bluster. “If you’re afraid to offend Donald Trump,” he said, “then what are you going to do when you’re sitting across from President Xi?” Christie seems to be the only person who recognizes the true stakes of the 2024 election. We know he’s not afraid of confronting the one true Republican front-runner. But he’s also shown a clear understanding of what another Trump presidency would mean, literally and figuratively. That honesty may not have made Christie popular in Tuscaloosa, Alabama — let’s face it, the boos prove it did not — but at least he will be remembered as a candidate who went down fighting and willing to acknowledge basic reality. That should count for something. For reasons that I cannot even begin to explain, Vivek Ramaswamy showed up at this debate determined to go after rival Nikki Haley’s foreign policy credentials. His alleged “gotcha” moment centered on the failure of Haley, a well-respected former ambassador to the United Nations, to immediately name three provinces in eastern Ukraine. (For the record, they are Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv.) As if that attack line is going to win over the Republican primary base or, frankly, anyone. Being able to Google the names of a bunch of Ukrainian provinces before a debate doesn’t make you seem smart, Vivek. It makes you seem weird, smug and out of touch. Which, in Ramaswamy’s defense, is very on brand. But that incredible lack of self-awareness is far, far more revealing than any short-term memory party trick. Vivek Ramaswamy: “Why am I the only person on this stage, at least, who can say that Jan. 6 now does look like it was an inside job?” Give that staggeringly false quote a few seconds to sink in. It’s worth noting that over 1,000 Trump supporters have been charged with participating in the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. A number of those charged have outright blamed former President Donald Trump for helping to incite the Capitol riot. Not the “deep state.” Not the Democrats. Not Joe Biden. Not the FBI. They blamed the guy who tweeted, “Be there, will be wild!” and who stood on a stage and said, “If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” I understand that Republicans like Ramaswamy are desperate to find ways to ingratiate themselves with Trump’s MAGA faithful. But the facts of the insurrection, and the people who participated in it, are not in dispute. There is zero evidence of a conspiracy, or whatever an “inside job” would mean in this instance. Republicans claim to be the Party of Personal Responsibility; now might be a good time to consider actually taking some.

MSNBC,The GOP just conflated antisemitism with anti-Zionism. That’s problematic.,2023-12-07 11:00:00,Zeeshan Aleem,"House Republicans put a resolution condemning antisemitism up for a vote on Tuesday. At first blush, that seemed like a laudable gesture. Antisemitism is on the rise around the world, and any spread of bigotry should and must be fought. But the resolution also contained controversial language declaring that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism.” That wording conflates criticism of Israel with bigotry against Jews, and the intention of such language is to discourage critical debate over Israel in Washington. The measure passed 311 to 14, with scores of Democrats joining Republicans. But more Democrats saw through the GOP’s tactics than that lopsided result might suggest — 92 voted present. That was a small but promising sign that Democrats are aware that Republicans are cynically trying to weaponize the issue of antisemitism, using it as a way to shield Israel from criticism as it wages an increasingly polarizing war in the Gaza Strip. It’s audacious for a party that’s taken an aggressive white nationalist turn to try to pull off this tactic. Anti-Zionism can mean different things to different people, and sometimes serves as a vehicle for antisemitism. Some people have criticized Zionism or Zionists in a veiled attempt to advance antisemitic conspiracy theories, or to argue that Israel should be ethnically cleansed of Jews. That kind of anti-Zionism is racist and deplorable. But it isn’t inherently so — the Jewish Voice for Peace, a left-wing, anti-Zionist Jewish social movement, sums up anti-Zionism as criticism of Israeli state policies or its ethno-state ideology. There are many antiracist ways to criticize Zionism, and there’s a long, rich history of such that comes from myriad religious and political quarters of the Jewish community itself. Some Jewish groups object to Zionism on theological grounds — seeing it as blasphemous because they believe only the messiah can bring about the true Israel. There are also liberal and left-wing Jewish criticisms of Zionism that date back to at least the early 20th century that take issue with the ideology as a contributor to dual loyalty antisemitism, or as a settler-colonial ideology. Today some of the leading voices critical of Israeli treatment of Palestinians are Jewish groups and commentators who reject or sharply critique Zionism — like Jewish Voice for Peace and the periodical Jewish Currents. And progressive Israelis have objected to “the Zionist paradigm” as the culprit for Israeli-Palestinian inequity. Of course people outside the Jewish community can also criticize Zionism uncoupled from antisemitism — including Palestinians displaced and discriminated against by the project of Israel who favor a two-state solution or a single secular democratic state. The belief that anti-Zionism isn’t inherently antisemitic is why three Jewish House Democrats — Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Daniel Goldman of New York and Jamie Raskin of Maryland — urged fellow Democrats to vote “present” on the resolution. “Under this resolution, those who love Israel deeply but criticize some of its policy approaches could be considered anti-Zionist,” Nadler, the longest-serving Jewish member of the House, said in a floor speech. “That could make every Democratic Jewish member of this body, because they all criticized the recent Israeli judicial reform package, de facto antisemites. Might that be the author’s intention?” It’s audacious for a party that’s taken an aggressive white nationalist turn to try to pull off this tactic. The party’s de facto leader, former President Donald Trump, bellows antisemitic tropes, boosts antisemitic white supremacists online and found the 2017 Charlottesville neo-Nazi gathering to have had some “very fine people.” The MAGA movement is a cesspool of antisemitic conspiracy theories. Some right-wingers would try to push back by calling attention to the GOP’s commitment to unconditionally supporting Israel and Zionism. But as many Jewish commentators have pointed out, there is a long and dark history of people identifying as friends of Zionism on religious or geostrategic grounds who are flagrant antisemites. The Republicans tried putting liberal and progressive Democrats in a bind by daring them to vote against a resolution that was outwardly only about antisemitism. Insofar as the resolution passed with just 14 objections, they succeeded. But one hopes that with comments like Nadler’s, which got some traction online, and critical commentary about it in the media, the Democrats will grow bolder in pushing back against such tactics over the long term.

MSNBC,Making ‘Squid Game’ a reality show ruins the whole point of ‘Squid Game’,2023-12-07 00:16:00,Noor Noman,"“Squid Game: The Challenge,” whose final episode is out Wednesday, is currently the most-watched show on Netflix in the U.S this week. It is the reality-TV version of the 2021 scripted Korean hit “Squid Game.” Much like in the show, contestants in “The Challenge” duke it out against one another in a series of cutthroat and disorienting games for a chance to win $4.56 million. Watching it, you can’t help but think the show’s creators are equal parts inspired and sick. Watching it, you can’t help but think the show’s creators are equal parts inspired and sick. The scripted series, in which those eliminated from the ruthless game are killed, is a damning critique of the so-called social darwinism of late-stage capitalism, the exaltation of money and the concomitant zero-sum construction of relations that such a system demands. This is symbolized by the enormous, transparent piggy bank that hovers above the contestants’ living quarters and upon which those contestants gaze with longing. Because with each elimination more money is added to the piggy bank, every contestant is literally worth money. Again, an apt metaphor for ruthless capitalism. However, because “The Challenge” features real people, many of whom are in dire financial straits and are desperate for the money, the show loses its ability to offer any meaningful critiques. In this case, as contestants longingly look up at a real-life version of the piggy bank and connive to get one another eliminated, we are immersed in the sad reality of the dehumanizing system we’ve created. The show celebrates the worst facets of late-stage capitalism, which privileges money above all else, even, or especially, at the expense of community and human connection. The premise of the show exploits many of the most vulnerable members of society, who have suffered from a lack of social safety nets, and it fetishizes their struggles. As on “Squid Game,” each “life” on “The Challenge” is worth money. With each elimination, $10,000 drops in the piggy bank, producing a range of responses from contestants. Some embrace the dehumanization. “For me, everybody is just money,” one contestant shrugs. Others appear more conflicted. Referring to the number of contestants, another one says, “We want those numbers to go down, but we forget why they’re going down.” “The Challenge” has a kitschy and slightly painful start: Eliminated contestants have fake blood bags explode under their shirts, imitating a sniper shot to the torso, à la the original version, and they are required to play dead. Before one is invested in any of the players, the whole thing feels a bit like the campy lovechild of a first-person shooter video game and a pantomime. But as the audience becomes more invested in the contestants and we learn of their often heartbreaking stories of financial distress, the stakes feel higher. For example, one contestant has a disabled young child and he and his wife struggle, financially, to plan for their child’s future, including funding the support they’ll need after he and his wife are gone. Another spent a lot of his childhood unhoused and wants to make ends meet for his own family. If anything, this show is unwittingly making a commentary on the brutalization of society, or the theory that legitimized violence begets more violence. The so-called games the contestants play often require psychological violence, and then there’s the enactment of actual death once a contestant is eliminated. It’s all symbolic of a winner-take-all system that exists in the real world. As MSNBC columnist Zeeshan Aleem wrote in October, recent research shows that, shockingly, the difference in life expectancy in the U.S. between those with and without college degrees is almost a decade. “Social inequality isn’t just leading to diverging quality of life for people in different social strata. It’s killing us,” Aleem noted. The toll of ruthless capitalism on our mental health is manifested in shaking, weeping, panic-stricken contestants, some who even fight the urge to vomit under the stress. In one of the final stages of the show, we see the women are outnumbered nearly 2:1 by men, which in and of itself creates emotional distress for the women who are competing. The “competition” and the implicit creation of social order that ensues unsurprisingly favors men, many of whom volunteer themselves for leadership positions or unilaterally make decisions for the group through coercion, but under the guise of democratic decision-making. The so-called games the contestants play often require psychological violence, and then there’s the enactment of actual death once a contestant is eliminated. “[T]he mental health effects of other axes of power, like racism, sexism, colonialism, and imperialism, cannot be fully understood without attending to their historically contingent forms under capitalism; likewise, capitalism’s mental health effects cannot be understood without attending to these other axes of power,” Jerzy Eisenberg-Guyot and Seth J. Prins explain in “The impact of capitalism on mental health: An epidemiological perspective,” a chapter in the Oxford Textbook of Social Psychiatry. The original “Squid Games,” with its fictional, dystopian world, offered us a needed critique of the barbarity of unfettered capitalism. Placing it in the real world, however, only seems to normalize, encourage and even celebrate the worst facets of our economic and political systems. So, while it makes for a gripping show, because the reality-show version inverts the point of the original show, the franchise has completely lost its way.

MSNBC,I had cancer as a kid. Trump threatening Obamacare makes me sick all over again.,2023-12-06 21:58:00,Gabrielle Marullo,"As a survivor of childhood cancer, I’m quite used to feeling sick. However, I felt a different kind of sick last week when former President Donald Trump vowed, as he has so many times before, to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. Trump tried and failed when he was president to get rid of President Barack Obama’s most significant accomplishment. “The cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it’s not good Healthcare. I’m seriously looking at alternatives,” Trump wrote on his social media platform. Trump isn’t promising anything that would bring prices down; he’s only scaring families like mine. My family can attest: Health care is too expensive — for everybody. However, Trump isn’t promising anything that would bring prices down; he’s only scaring families like mine. In 2004, when I was 4 years old, my pediatrician, who was concerned that I wasn’t growing like I should, ordered bloodwork. That test revealed that I was anemic. Then, after my skin turned to a pale yellow, my parents got the diagnosis that floored them: I had childhood leukemia. The thought of burying their youngest child devastated my parents, but they shared a brief sigh of relief when the doctors said I had a good chance of surviving. Then, the bills started arriving. My mom and dad, both 44 then, ‌worked respectively as an MRI tech/medical biller and as a New Orleans firefighter. They had a decent savings account. However, my mountain of medical bills destroyed them financially and decimated their savings. They were left with terrible credit scores that suggested that they’d been irresponsible when, really, they’d done nothing but make sure that I, their sick child, got treatment. Six years later, after I had gone into remission, Congress passed the ACA. Having seen the financial duress my parents had been put under, I understood even then how important this legislation would be to families like mine — families caught up in the ongoing crisis of rising health care costs and the threat of being denied insurance altogether in the face of grave diagnoses. Between 2004 and 2007, there were many times that my parents dragged me out of bed and rushed me to the emergency room in the middle of the night because, as everyone who has lived through childhood cancer knows, a temperature more than 100.4 degrees demands emergency care. On top of already feeling terrible, upon our arrival, I would watch my parents pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket. I was only a child, and cancer was not anything I could’ve avoided, but that part always made me feel worse. It made me feel less like a human and more like a problem. Trump isn’t wrong to say that health care is expensive but, because my cancer came before the existence of the ACA, I can also attest that the high cost of health care isn’t the fault of the legislation. Health care costs were high and rising before that landmark legislation. For families who get the frightening news like my parents got in 2004, the ACA may be their only chance to have insurance, without which they or their loved one couldn’t get treatment. Perhaps most importantly, the ACA means that a cancer I had when I was 4 won’t mean that I can’t get health insurance as an adult. But Trump talks about the ACA as though the law itself is hurting me more than being denied health insurance would. I would watch my parents pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket. Cancer was not anything I could’ve avoided, but that part always made me feel worse. It made me feel less like a human and more like a problem. No, Obamacare didn’t solve the problem of Americans suffering from medical debt. In 2021, the Commonwealth Fund found that Americans then had an estimated $88 billion in medical debt and that medical debt was the largest source of debt for Americans. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, says that medical debt causes around 500,000 Americans to go bankrupt every year. According to Yahoo Finance, tens of thousands of Americans are turning to crowdfunding sites each year in a last-ditch effort to prevent their medical debts from driving them into bankruptcy. “Well,” my mom would say as she stared down one massive bill after another, “they can’t eat us.” Even so, almost 20 years later, the debt for my cancer treatment is still eating away at my parents' credit scores. A solution would be to transition from our current privatized health care system to the kind of universal, government-funded system that’s common around the world, more cost effective, generally leads to better health outcomes and doesn’t leave families shouldering such a heavy financial burden. But, I know that that isn’t one of the “serious alternatives” Trump is allegedly looking at. His getting rid of the ACA wouldn’t address the high costs of health care or high medical debt; he’d just be getting rid of the health insurance some of us might not otherwise have.

MSNBC,Here’s what Nikki Haley needs to do to beat Trump. And it's not humiliate Ramaswamy.,2023-12-06 11:00:00,Charlie Dent,"In the race to derail Donald Trump, the Republican presidential field is struggling. As the remaining candidates prepare for their fourth debate tonight, only one GOP hopeful seems to have any sort of chance ahead of the primaries. While Chris Christie is hoping to strike lightning in New Hampshire, the former New Jersey governor has effectively weaponized himself to make powerful arguments against Trump’s electability and fitness. Unlike most of the diminishing GOP field, Christie understands the imperative of prosecuting the case against Trump and his record. He also recognizes the importance of speaking to Americans not part of the Trump MAGA base who will vote in a general election. But for now, his polling and fundraising numbers are not where they need to be. As the remaining candidates prepare for their fourth debate tonight, only one GOP hopeful seems to have any sort of chance ahead of the primaries. That leaves the other candidate in the race who recognizes there are persuadable independent and moderate voters: Nikki Haley. The former U.N. ambassador has shown herself to be a serious, substantive and feisty campaigner. Her smackdowns of Vivek Ramaswamy during the first three debates have demonstrated her capacity to launch piercing, effective attacks without appearing mean-spirited. But sparring with Ramaswamy, while entertaining, will have little to no impact on the race. Unlike Christie, Haley has still not in any meaningful way directed her fire and considerable rhetorical skills at Trump. If Haley hopes to prevail in the primaries, she better sharpen her stilettos and play some smashmouth offense. Second place is last place. Luckily for Haley, her political skills and moderate tone appeal to much of the donor class who have soured on Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis. With fellow South Carolinian Sen. Tim Scott out of the race, Haley will have more opportunities of securing non-Trump, major donors for her spirited campaign. She’ll need money to grind out wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, as Trump maintains a commanding lead over her and the remaining GOP candidates. Haley did receive a much-needed boost last week, with a timely endorsement from the Charlie Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity Action. Koch's political network will provide a grassroots army that can pound the pavement and light up the phone lines, engaging voters by mail, digitally and on the airwaves. In Haley, the Koch network saw a candidate with an aspirational message, even if that message does not conform with the typically less aggressive, non-interventionist foreign policy advocated by those in Koch world. But clearly, in this post-Trump world, devotion to ideological litmus tests has gone out the window. The Koch endorsement is just one step forward, however. Haley must do more — a lot more. She needs to channel her inner Chris Christie and make the case that Trump has repeatedly exercised horrible judgement, is a threat to the constitutional order, is erratic, undisciplined, and too great a risk with four criminal indictments. It’s time to turn the page. Moreover, Haley must attack frontally and directly. Often underestimated, Haley has proven her critics wrong thus far. For example, until recently, she has managed the abortion question skillfully, arguing for greater pragmatism and realism. Haley knows abortion is an enormous political vulnerability for the GOP and speaks compassionately about women who find themselves in this deeply difficult and personal predicament. She had meticulously avoided taking a draconian position, refusing to endorse a federal ban and wanting to leave the matter to the states. But that's why Haley’s recent support of a six-week abortion ban was such a serious error. The Democrats have pounced. For all his many faults, contradictions, prevarications and inconsistencies, Trump seems to understand the folly of extreme abortion politics. Even a broken watch is correct twice every day. Sensing an opportunity, Christie is on the record strongly opposing a six-week abortion ban, hoping to pick off support of major donors who tend to be more moderate on the issue. Republicans would be wise to follow a blue state conservative governor on this and other issues. From his experience in New Jersey, Christie instinctively knows how to spot landmines in difficult political terrain. For now, the Koch endorsement will give Haley’s campaign some energy and reinforcements. But tonight, Haley must focus on her true opponent, and forego spending any significant time or energy swatting at the distractions standing next to her on the debate stage. Time will tell if Haley is truly willing to do what it takes to defeat an opponent who knows no boundaries and will do whatever it takes to win.

MSNBC,I have bad news for the progressives currently beguiled by Liz Cheney,2023-12-06 02:21:00,Ana Marie Cox,"I have bad news for the progressives currently beguiled by Liz Cheney’s deft skewering of her erstwhile Republican colleagues: She is not going to love you back. Cheney’s new book, “Oath and Honor: A Memoir and a Warning,” has become an immediate bestseller based on its promise to bring even more receipts to the Trump indictment party. (And she does have receipts.) Her message to anyone who has ever knitted a “pussy hat” hits right in the feels: Donald Trump is a “grave threat” to American democracy, a man “willing to torch the constitution,” and thus “[h]e has to be defeated, and people can’t be bystanders.” Ironically, her last book had an equally dire warning — about Democrats post-Barack Obama. Ironically, her last book had an equally dire warning — about Democrats post-Barack Obama. “Our next president must be committed to restoring America’s power and strength,” she and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, wrote in “Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America.” “Our security and the survival of freedom depend on it.” It’s almost as if they were calling for our next president to make America great again. Others have illustrated the straight line that connects the rabid anti-Obama xenophobia and racism of the tea party movement — a movement Cheney embraced — and the mob that forced its way into the Capitol on Jan. 6. That ideological genealogy doesn’t make Cheney responsible for Jan. 6. Nor does it mean we shouldn’t take her current warnings less seriously. But it should temper the applause she gets in 2023 for making the same observations that plenty of people made in 2015. Democrats should be wary of investing this much political capital in a politician who is all but telling them about her intention to eventually betray them. Cheney’s political transformation isn’t, in fact, very transformative. It’s one thing to have the scales fall from one’s eyes completely — to stumble upon one lie you told yourself, or that you were told, and then have a whole edifice of untruths unravel. Former Wall Street Journal columnist Max Boot became a “Never Trumper” along with a host of other neocons when Trump’s terrible ambitions became clear. But then he did something rare and almost singular in that company: He also re-examined all the other beliefs that had kept him in the party that nominated Trump. Boot wound up apologizing for his part in promoting the Iraq War and, even more astonishingly, admitted that the GOP’s entire political project since 1964 has been built on a not-very-thinly disguised foundation of racism. (Something, he allowed, “liberals have been saying for decades.”) Ousting Trump isn’t enough, Boot argued; the Republican Party must be “burned to the ground” and “suffer repeated and devastating defeats” in order to have any hope of building “a reasonable center-right party out of the ashes.” Cheney shows no sign of such expansive reconsiderations. Her call to arms is narrow-cast in the extreme: defeat Trump. She hasn’t said too much about what might follow. She may even assume she is the sort of Republican who could replace him. And that, as a reminder, would mean replacing Trump with a Republican who has consistently confirmed her commitment to restricting bodily autonomy and admits that climate change is happening but says there are “real questions about why and what’s causing it.” There are not. Cheney shows no sign of such expansive reconsiderations. Her call to arms is narrow-cast in the extreme. She has very gently come around on marriage equality. This is a notable shift given how she voiced her opposition to gay marriage in 2013, after her then-warm relationship with her gay sister, Mary, became an issue in the Wyoming Senate Republican campaign. Liz’s eventual recognition that she was “wrong” to oppose gay marriage came months after she lost her re-election primary in 2021, and after the end of her career in this version of Republican Party. I understand the impulse to embrace former evildoers; compassion for the convert is one of humanity’s most precious psychological tics. An old enemy admitting they were wrong is also fun! The more vaunted the foe, the more delight one takes in the admission of fault; the more twisted their past, the more one can exult upon bringing them into the light. And, indeed, I’ve indulged in this kind of crowing, giving hours of airtime on my old podcast to former Republican dirty trickster Rick Wilson. A great interview! Hilarious! Would I want him to run the country? Not really! High-profile antagonists also provide potentially valuable intel. Opposition research is, as I said, part of the supposed value of Cheney’s book. But we know a lot about Jan. 6 already. We know even more about the awfulness of Trump Republicans. I think what liberals are truly hoping to find in Cheney’s tome is more abstract: the key to repeating the miracle of her supposed rebirth. It’s an understandable, and even worthwhile, quest. But I’m just not sure there’s a magic potion to be extracted from this narrative, nothing to drip into your racist uncle’s coffee at Christmas dinner that will make him see the light. Liz Cheney is, with respect to policy, a “typical Republican.” But in respect to everything else, she’s a Cheney: assured of her place in the political and economic firmament for as long as America exists — and maybe even afterward. With her vast wealth and robust network of powerful friends, she certainly could weather a Trump second term better than most, even if that means fleeing to a country without an extradition treaty. Her position as a Cheney also means the risks she took in opposing Trump remain minimal compared to those for anyone who works for a living or whose political career had some other starting point besides working for her father’s successful (if not popularly elected) White House campaign. Liberals become enthralled with characters like Liz Cheney because we want to know how it was done and what we can do to make it happen again. But the sad truth is that nothing can change someone’s mind until they’re ready for it to be changed. Even Cheney, who voted for Trump in his first run, clearly never liked the guy, calling his statements about women “appalling” in 2016 and his foreign policy decisions “disastrous” two years later. Liberals become enthralled with characters like Liz Cheney because we want to know how it was done and what we can do to make it happen again. For a lot of people, the cracks in their belief systems come only when they’ve been under terrific pressure and through unbearable pain. So I guess my question is would Liz Cheney be the media darling she is today if things hadn’t gotten quite as bad as they did? If we were living through Hillary Clinton’s second term, would Mary Cheney still be waiting for her apology? What kind of legislation would Cheney be supporting if some alt-timeline, majority-liberal Supreme Court held sway and Roe was still the law of the land? I think she’d still be the Republican she was before she got to Congress. And I prefer that alternate universe. On some level, I want to prevent conversions like Cheney’s, not create more of them. I want things to never get so bad that someone like Cheney changes her mind. According to her book, Cheney was plenty aware of Trump’s election conspiracy perfidy and the escalating plans for a coup. She didn’t tell the press or go public with her concerns. She had been a mild supporter and became a subdued critic. What pushed Liz Cheney to outraged opposition were the specific and horrific events of Jan. 6. It just shouldn’t take that much. Ana Marie Cox is a political journalist and author.

MSNBC,A new 2024 youth poll doesn’t look promising for Biden,2023-12-05 23:36:00,Zeeshan Aleem,"The evidence that President Joe Biden has a problem with young voters just got stronger. A new poll from the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School shows that young people are significantly less inclined to vote in the 2024 election than they were at roughly this point ahead of the 2020 election. In the Institute of Politics poll, which was conducted from Oct. 23 to Nov. 6, just 49% of 18- to 29-year-olds across the political spectrum said they “definitely” planned to vote next year. That’s a marked drop from the fall of 2019, when 57% said they “definitely” planned to vote. That drop is far more pronounced among Republicans (who fell from 66% to 56%) than Democrats (who fell from 68% to 66%). But the plurality of 18- to 29-year-olds are independents, and their commitment to “definitely” voting dropped from 41% to 31%. That’s more likely to hurt Democrats, as young independents tend to vote more Democratic. And the trend was especially pronounced among racial minority groups who skew Democratic: Young Black Americans dropped from 50% to 38% from 2019 to 2023, and young Hispanic Americans fell from 56% to 40%. Young voters were crucial to Democrats’ victories in 2020 and 2022. In a hypothetical match-up against Donald Trump in the poll, Biden leads by 11 points among young Americans, 41%-30%. (Thirteen percent of respondents say they are undecided, and an additional 15% say they wouldn’t vote.) But when potential independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Joe Manchin and Cornel West are added to the offerings, Biden’s lead is reduced to just 4 points. Polling a year out from the election should be taken with many grains of salt. These numbers aren’t predictive of the vote; they’re only a snapshot in time. Any number of factors could drive up interest in voting overall, or Biden’s numbers specifically, between now and Election Day. But the numbers certainly aren’t promising for the Democrats. Young voters were crucial to Democrats’ victories in 2020 and 2022. They don’t need to flip to Trump in order to deal Biden a lethal blow; disproportionate declines in turnout would be enough. Part of Biden’s ongoing struggle with young voters stems from the same vexing riddle Biden faces with Americans as a whole. Despite strong economic growth, a low unemployment rate, rising wages and slowing inflation, recent surveys show that Americans have a negative outlook on the economy, and in this new poll, young voters trust Trump over Biden on handling the economy by a 15-point margin. It’s more difficult to figure out the fallout from the biggest news story at the time the survey was conducted: the Israel-Hamas war. By the time the IOP ran this survey, raucous protests at odds with the Biden administration’s position on Israel broke out across the country. The poll reflects the way that issue divides young Democrats, 46% of whom trust Biden more on the issue, 9% of whom trust Trump more and 45% of whom say neither. Among independents, 56% trust neither Biden nor Trump. In light of threats from pro-Palestinian activist groups’ saying they may withhold their votes for Biden over his Israel policy, it’s possible that some of Biden’s weakening among independents could be attributed to this issue. But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict very well may be a lot less salient in news discourse and in voters’ minds in a year. Some of the downturn in voter interest among young Americans could be a function of Biden’s being the incumbent rather than Trump. In the run-up to 2020, young voters were bombarded daily with news stories about extremist right-wing policies and plots, racist and authoritarian rhetoric, and impropriety and corruption in the federal government. Motivation to oust a dangerous incumbent is more likely to pique voter interest than retaining a less existentially threatening incumbent. Additionally, Biden’s decisive 2020 victory may have led some younger voters to believe that Trump has been defanged, particularly as he faces up to four criminal trials between now and the next election. What remains to be seen is whether the specter of a plausible Trump return would ultimately revive interest among young voters closer to November. The optimistic way to read the data is that as Election Day nears and the real stakes of a second Trump term grow clearer, more young Americans will recognize the urgency of planning for voting. But given consistent polling showing Biden weak among young voters, it is in the president's interest to take steps to energize this part of the Democratic base through fresh and bold policy proposals. Relying on fear of Trump alone is a risky strategy. Zeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

MSNBC,"Pretending to care this much about football is the latest, cynical political game",2023-12-06 00:23:00,Ken J. Makin,"The day after the College Football Playoff committee decided not to include undefeated Florida State in the four teams that made the playoff (but did include one-loss teams Texas and Alabama), former President Donald Trump took to his social media platform to blame Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Trump said the Seminoles team “was treated very badly by the ‘Committee.’” Then, he said, “Lets blame DeSanctimonious” for the “Really bad lobbying effort.” A governor shouldn’t have anything to do with whether a football team in his state gets to play for a national championship, but it will be hard for DeSantis to call out Trump’s comment as inappropriate. A governor shouldn’t have anything to do with whether a football team in his state gets to play for a national championship, but it will be hard for DeSantis to call out Trump’s comment as inappropriate given that he himself has now pledged $1 million for any lawsuit filed that challenges the exclusion of the 13-0 Seminoles from the four final teams. If you’re counting, DeSantis’ pledge to assist any frivolous lawsuit that arises from what he perceives to be a snub is the same amount he pledged to bolster security at Edward Waters University after a man carried out a racist mass shooting that killed three Black people near the HBCU in August. (DeSantis pledged another $100,000 to help families affected by that tragedy.) Republican politicians obviously want their constituents to believe that they care about football. As Trump was blaming DeSantis and DeSantis was encouraging litigation, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., was sending a three-page letter to CFP chair Boo Corrigan demanding answers for FSU’s being snubbed. “There are hopes, dreams and billions of dollars in economic activity that hinge on the decisions made by the 13-member group you lead,” Scott wrote. “Given the unprecedented nature of your recent decision, an unprecedented commitment to transparency is required.” But that’s not the only regrettable mix of football and politics we’ve seen recently. On the Saturday after Thanksgiving, during halftime of the annual contest between hated intrastate rivals Clemson and South Carolina, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, to cheers and jeers, brought Trump out onto the field as his honored guest. Why was Trump there? Simple. A college football game lasts 60 minutes, but campaigning never stops. Trump’s visit to South Carolina — more specifically, McMaster’s inviting him to South Carolina — was the proverbial wiping of the feet on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s couch. (She’s the South Carolinian candidate for president now that Sen. Tim Scott has dropped out.) One hopes that while Trump was in Columbia, he saw the digital billboards that were “Sponsored by League of Radical Leftist Vermin — Jay Bender Instigator.” The billboards read: “You lost. You’re guilty. Welcome to Columbia, Donald.” Bender, according to the Columbia newspaper The State, is a Columbia attorney who represents multiple news organizations in the state. Before the game, the South Carolina Democratic Party also weighed in on Trump’s scheduled visit. “This Palmetto Bowl photo op reeks of desperation — for a candidate who keeps proclaiming the primary over, Donald Trump keeps campaigning like he might have something to lose,” party spokesperson Alyssa Bradley said in a statement. “Here’s to hoping no one fumbles as badly as Donald Trump is fumbling his campaign here in South Carolina.” Calling the actions of Trump, DeSantis and Scott political pandering would be an understatement. Even with the indisputable economic impact college football has, it’s nonsensical that these Republican politicians are prioritizing college football and its fans over urgent needs such as health care, education and civil rights. This Palmetto Bowl photo op reeks of desperation — for a candidate who keeps proclaiming the primary over, Donald Trump keeps campaigning like he might have something to lose. — S.C. Democratic Party spokeswoman ALYSSA BRADLEY Trolling is to be expected in college football. But trolling the way Trump did when he blamed DeSantis for Florida State’s not getting in represents a mockery of our political process. Yes, all the Republicans mentioned no doubt see in college football fans the votes they think they need to win, but fighting about the worthiness of Florida State’s football team is absurd. Florida state Rep. Angie Nixon, who has called out DeSantis in the past, called him out some more Tuesday morning on the X social media platform. “Good morning to everyone except Ron Desantis who wants to use 1 MILLION of our tax dollars … because FSU didn’t get picked,” read a screenshot on Nixon’s page. “What would you do with $1M?” A call for change followed: “We’re over 30 years in with republican rule in Florida. Come November, we can change this in the state legislature.” Nixon’s tweet is a reminder that as some politicians fight over who should have gotten a chance to play for a national championship, there’s something bigger than a game — political or football — hanging in the balance.

MSNBC,Trump's second-term threats are the story of 2024,2023-12-05 11:00:00,Hayes Brown,"Some sympathy is warranted for how difficult it’s been for so-called traditional media outlets to report on Donald Trump. He violates norms as easily as he breathes, and if there were a record for number of lies told in a single sentence, Trump would shatter it regularly. During the former president’s time in office, it was difficult to accurately convey the enormity of his deviation from precedent without sounding like a partisan operative engaged in hyperbole. Even simply reporting what Trump says can feel fraught, given how often his remarks are preposterous lies, half-truths, debunked conspiracy theories and delusions of grandeur. Too many news outlets have had a seeming obsession to cover Trump as though he’s just like every other political candidate or officeholder. That has never been the case. It’s a habit that’s got to be broken as the marathon that is 2024 presidential race coverage hits its stride. Thankfully, there are signs that this time around mainstream political reporters and editors are more willing to call things as they see them when it comes to what a second Trump term would mean for the country, even if it means a departure from the ways they’ve previously attempted to show objectivity. Too many news outlets have had a seeming obsession to cover Trump as though he’s just like every other political candidate or officeholder. There is something that has seemingly made the task of honestly covering Trump less daunting this time around: Trump, his campaign and his operatives have been more than willing to plainly state his plans for a second term. His intent to turn the Justice Department into his own personal weapon is well-documented; his campaign messaging is specifically framed around his calls for revenge against his political enemies. There are hundreds of pages detailing these plans and ample reporting on their origins. As a result, even the more “small-c conservative” outlets and reporters that would otherwise fetishize a particular version of objectivity have spoken plainly about Trump’s “naked challenge to democratic values,” as The New York Times put it Monday. That article said that “Republicans in Congress would be even more pliable in any second Trump term,” accurately naming them as abettors to his autocratic aims without, in a misguided aim to provide balance, accusing Democrats of similar behavior. Meanwhile, Jonathan Karl, chief Washington correspondent for ABC News and an archetype for the traditional “straight news political reporter,” didn’t mince words in a recent interview with The Bulwark’s Bill Kristol about what’s to come. Here’s how The Bulwark’s Jonathan Last summed up Karl's remarks: He’s interviewed Trump and loads of Republicans. He told Kristol that 95 percent of the sourcing for his book came from Republicans, many of whom worked for Trump. And the picture they painted for Karl was dystopian. · Acting appointments from top to bottom. · A cadre of thousands of political appointees, vetted for personal loyalty to Trump, replacing career civil servants. · An understanding among Trump lieutenants that they are free to break the law because they will be pardoned. · An overriding desire on the part of Trump to seek retribution against perceived enemies. It’s encouraging to hear these venerable institutions and the journalists they employ speak plainly about what we can already see happening before our very eyes. But the glacial pace of this shift has been frustrating because Trump has never been keen on keeping his autocratic plans secret. He wasn’t shy about his intent to stay in office no matter what, lying about the “rigged” nature of the vote long before Election Day 2020 and long after it was clear he’d lost. He’s prone to blurting out whatever the thrust of his machinations is at any given moment and letting it get lost in the firehose of words that are constantly flowing out of his mouth. His absence of a filter leads to another major issue in covering Trump: his penchant for blatantly but unconvincingly lying like a child whenever he’s confronted with his past statements. In that scenario, his response, if not an outright fabrication, is typically a version of the truth that would make sense only if audio and video recordings didn’t exist. Networks have begun to insist on taped interviews with Trump because live interviews hinder journalists’ ability to fact-check him. Most importantly, what the media needs to do is keep this same energy we’re seeing and apply it to everything written between now and Election Day. Journalists have also been in a bind as to how to edit video of Trump speaking or how to accurately convey his remarks, because editing his speeches and remarks in a way that makes sense to the listener or reader may not be objective but may be doing him a favor. As Australian journalist Lenore Taylor wrote in 2019 on a visit to the U.S., transforming his rambling speaking style, which has grown only more pronounced since he left office, into something resembling a coherent narrative only makes him sound less off-the-wall than he truly is. Of course, there are still blind spots that media organizations need to address. People writing headlines and chyrons about Trump, which are all some people see as they scan the news or flip through channels, still struggle to convey much-needed context. We also still see that coverage can be slow to find the real news in his verbal onslaught. Such struggles can lead to buried leads, like the infamously anodyne headline on a Times piece about the speech Trump gave in which he called his political opponents “vermin.” The Times’ original headline read, “Trump Takes Veterans Day Speech in a Very Different Direction.” Most importantly, what the media needs to do is keep this same energy we’re seeing and apply it to everything written between now and Election Day. His autocratic tendencies and dystopian vision of America’s future are not context for the story; they are the story, much more so than the horse race at any given moment. Accordingly, Trump’s threat to democracy is a reality that needs to be reflected in all stories about the election, not just the ones that specifically seek to call out his plans.

MSNBC,COP28's alarming conflict of interest,2023-12-05 11:00:00,Phyllis Cuttino,"Is it too much to ask that the world’s most important climate summit, where the future of the planet will be decided, is protected from the demands of Big Oil? It is, after all, the very people driving the crisis that the summit is meant to address. Apparently it is. Leaked emails obtained by the Centre for Climate Reporting and the BBC suggest that the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, or ADNOC, was aiming to use COP28, hosted by the United Arab Emirates, to seek out new deals for its oil and gas production. ADNOC’s CEO is Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, who also happens to be president of COP28, as the United Nations climate negotiations are known. A COP president’s simultaneously leading an oil company planning expansion is a blatant conflict of interest. So the reports of abuses of power aren’t surprising, but — as former Vice President Al Gore says — they are still “utterly appalling.” The COP28 team has downplayed the leak, telling the BBC that al-Jaber is “singularly focused on the business of COP and delivering ambitious and transformational climate outcomes at COP28.” Nevertheless, a recent investigation by Global Oil and Gas Exit List, a database of the oil and gas industry, revealed that ADNOC’s plans to ramp up its future fossil fuel extraction put it at the top of the list of companies whose forecast emissions from new oil and gas fields will burn through our global carbon budget the fastest. Meanwhile, Darren Woods, the CEO of ExxonMobil, another front-runner in the race to expand fossil fuel production, claimed last month that reducing the supply of fossil fuels would only cause “human hardship and a poorer world.” We know that’s not true. Fossil fuels are driving human suffering as extreme weather and climate events increase in frequency and intensity. Right now, renewables clearly represent the future, and to suggest that developing countries need to dig for fossil fuels opens them up to the risk of stranded assets when the market dries up. In a policy statement issued in December 2021, Exxon talked up fossil fuel employment opportunities in the U.S. while complaining that “obstacles to accessing U.S. offshore oil and gas resources continue to limit development through broad regulatory overreach.” A ban on new oil and gas exploration on federal land, the statement claimed, would cost “up to one million jobs” in the following year. Slowing down the global transition to green energy is the real job killer. Slowing down the global transition to green energy is the real job killer. A new report by the International Energy Agency states that “more people work in the energy sector today than in 2019, almost exclusively due to growth in clean energy, which now employs more workers than fossil fuels.” According to the report, clean energy industries created 4.7 million new jobs from 2019 to 2022. More people now work in renewables than work in fossil fuels, and that growth is continuing at pace. Recently published research has also shown that most fossil fuel workers have skills that are easily transferable to renewable energy industries. With careful, location-specific investment, I believe a just transition can be achieved. At the same time, climate change itself constitutes a huge risk to jobs and livelihoods as infrastructure, agricultural yields and natural resources are all diminished at an alarming rate. Climate-driven extreme weather events already cause massive disruption to food production, and soil erosion and changing temperatures will affect the type, volume and quality of food we can grow and eat. To be clear, the presence of fossil fuel companies at COP28 doesn’t make it a write-off. Members of my organization — The Climate Reality Project — and thousands of others have come to the Gulf to demand action before it’s too late. But the positive news won’t come if the voices of governments and corporations that contribute most to the problem of climate change are the only ones that are heard. People on the front lines of climate change must be prioritized: people whose lives are threatened by the wildfires that now regularly rage across the globe; people who have seen their farmland devastated by flooding; people who, in the case of some Pacific and Caribbean states, may see their nations entirely lost to rising sea levels within our lifetimes. Climate Reality leaders like Rituraj Phukan of India, the founder of the Indigenous People’s Climate Justice Forum, and Jatziri Pando, an environmental lawyer working with the Mexican Senate, are essential to the process. They bring representation — and solutions — to COP28. Too many others, it’s becoming clear, are instead focused on delay and obfuscation. COP is important — too important to be undermined by the greenwashing efforts of fossil fuel-vested interests. The controversy over the COP president’s simultaneously leading one of the world’s biggest oil companies has made it obvious that reform is needed. It’s vital that climate negotiations are carried out in good faith and on a level playing field. That means placing global majority voices front and center and no longer prioritizing those who have reaped the profits from destructive industries. The path forward couldn’t be clearer: We must shake off the influence of the fossil fuel industry, adopt the urgent phase-out of fossil fuels necessary to address the climate crisis and seek reforms to the process — reforms such as a robust conflict-of-interest policy, added transparency and decision-making that doesn’t rely on total consensus. A healthy and sustainable future depends on it.

USA TODAY,"After Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling, race-based scholarships under scrutiny",2023-07-06 21:40:05,Alia Wong,"Corrections & Clarifications: This article was revised on July 7, 2023, to clarify that Walter M. Kimbrough is no longer the president of Dillard University. The Supreme Court's decision last week banning affirmative action in college admissions says nothing about scholarships, but aid tied to students' race is already off the table at several large universities. In Missouri, the attorney general directed all colleges to ""immediately"" stop considering race in scholarships, and in Kentucky, the flagship university’s president suggested the institution should do the same. Even in purple Wisconsin, the assembly’s Republican speaker alluded to forthcoming legislation that would ban race-conscious financial aid. Advocates say these scholarships are one of the few levers colleges have left to be proactive about enrolling students of color now that they can no longer consider race as one of many factors in admissions. That’s especially true as institutions in some states also roll back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs – and as young people nationwide question the worth of taking on student loan debt. “The assault on affirmative action was simply the foundation to go after everything,” tweeted Walter M. Kimbrough, former president of Dillard University in Louisiana. “Affirmative action bans won’t have the reach that ending these scholarship programs will.” Race largely has been a factor in admissions only at the nation's most selective, elite universities. Scholarships that consider students' race or ethnicity are widely available. A divide only growing: The college-going gap between Black and white Americans was always bad. It’s getting worse. Shortly after the court issued its ruling, Andrew Bailey, Missouri’s Republican attorney general, sent a letter to all the state’s colleges, public and private, ordering them to implement the decisions “immediately.” “All Missouri programs that make admitting decisions by disfavoring individuals based on race – not just college admissions, but also scholarships, employment, law reviews, etc. – must immediately adopt race-blind standards,” he wrote. The University of Missouri system, which doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and is predominantly white, has at least until recently offered scholarships that considered race as one of many factors. In response to the letter, it stated: ""Those practices will be discontinued, and we will abide by the new Supreme Court ruling concerning legal standards that applies to race-based admissions and race-based scholarships.” Last year, 5.5% of MU's students were Black and 5.3% were Hispanic. Fewer than 3% identified as Asian. Just 5% of the university's total spending on scholarships last year went toward aid for people of color. Similar developments are brewing in Kentucky. “We are still reviewing the details of the ruling, but, based on our initial understanding, it appears that the court has restricted the consideration of race with respect to admissions and scholarships,” Eli Capilouto, the University of Kentucky's president, said last Thursday. Also on Thursday, Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of Wisconsin’s state assembly, indicated he’d work to abolish such scholarships in his state. Vos was responding to a tweet arguing numerous higher education aid programs in the state amount to discrimination under the court’s ruling. The tweeter, an attorney and alumnus of the conservative Christian Hillsdale College, pointed to grants earmarked for Black American students, American Indian students, and students of Hispanic or certain Southeast Asian descents. “We are reviewing the decision and will introduce legislation to correct the discriminatory laws on the books and pass repeals in the fall,” Vos tweeted Thursday afternoon, also retweeting a user claiming Ivy League colleges “hate rural whites.” This “apparent push to end minority scholarships is thinly veiled white ""revanchism,” wrote MSNBC blogger Ja’han Jones. After the ruling, Ed Blum, the architect of the cases challenging Harvard's and the University of North Carolina's affirmative action programs, said, “Virtually all race-exclusive scholarships were already illegal as I understand the law. But whatever confusion there may have been before the (Students for Fair Admissions) ruling, it is correct that race-exclusive fellowships, scholarships, and general educational programs must end.” Henock Solomon, 26, is a rising third-year law student at the University of Colorado Boulder. Since his days as a K-12 student, scholarships have given him educational opportunities he wouldn't have had otherwise. These scholarships, some of which were designated for African Americans, allowed him to attend private school, earn his undergraduate degree and enroll in law school. Had it not been for that aid, Solomon says, he would have had to ""completely reevaluate what I want to do."" ""It's very hard for us to get into these advanced fields because of the costs and because of the time,"" he said. Getting rid of them ""will further perpetuate a pipeline and a system where the only people who have the opportunity to be in those fields are people who come from good financial situations."" Even as states including Missouri unwind race-based scholarships, however, many colleges and organizations have reiterated their commitment to scholarships and other programs aimed at making campuses more diverse. Charles Barkley, the TV commentator and former NBA player, said he would be updating his will to leave Auburn University in Alabama $5 million for scholarships for Black students. ""That's just my way of trying to make sure Auburn stays diverse,"" he said of his alma mater. More than 3 in 4 students or 78% at the land-grant institution are white. Even before affirmative action ban, Many flagship universities didn't reflect their state’s Black or Latino high school grads Given the racial disparities even at public universities like Auburn, the stakes of these scholarships, advocates say, have never been higher. Citing those stakes, legal and financial aid experts are urging colleges and state leaders to be cautious with their directives. “The SCOTUS opinion was squarely focused on institutions’ admissions policies,” Justin Draeger, president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, told the online publication Inside Higher Ed. “The highest court in the country took months to deliberate on this issue, and schools should similarly consider any implications on financial aid ... (and) be careful about overreacting.” Contact Alia Wong at (202) 507-2256 or awong@usatoday.com.

USA TODAY,Russian warplanes harass US drones over Syria: 'Dangerously close',2023-07-06 22:26:36,Tom Vanden Brook,"WASHINGTON — Russian warplanes buzzed American drone spy planes over Syria Thursday, the second day in a row that Russian pilots have harassed MQ-9 Reaper drones conducting surveillance missions on ISIS militants, according to the United States military. In Thursday's incident, the Russian fighter jets dropped flares in front of the drones and ""flew dangerously close"" to the Reapers, Air Force Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich, commander of the 9th Air Force, said in a statement. The unsafe tactics come as tensions between Russia and the U.S. remain high over western support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. ""The repeated violations, of Russian air forces, of agreed-upon standards and practices, is now becoming a significant safety concern in the region,"" Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, tweeted late Thursday. Air Force officials on Thursday tweeted ""Once again today Russian fighter aircraft flew incredibly unsafe and unprofessionally against both French and U.S. aircraft over Syria,"" adding ""We fully support our French allies right to conduct security missions in the region."" Thursday's encounter followed a similar unsafe intercept over Syria on Wednesday, according to the Pentagon. Russia supports Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime, which has brutally prosecuted its end of a civil war there. Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said three Russian fighter jets dropped parachute flares to drop in front of the drones, and one Russian fighter jet engaged its afterburner in front of a drone to harass it on Wednesday. Ryder called on the Russian military to cease its ""reckless behavior."" He dismissed reported Russian claims that the drones had been operating in a restricted area.

USA TODAY,Titan submersible implosion updates: OceanGate says it has suspended operations,2023-07-06 17:33:30,N'dea Yancey-Bragg,"OceanGate, the company that owned the destroyed Titan submersible, says it has suspended ""all exploration and commercial operations"" after the vessel's deadly implosion last month during an expedition to the remains of the Titanic. Five people died in the disaster. The latest news comes after the U.S. Coast Guard announced last week that human remains were likely recovered from the wreckage. Debris from the vessel, which was plagued by a history of safety concerns, were taken ashore at a Canadian Coast Guard pier. The announcement that operations had been suspended was visible at the top of the company's website on Thursday, but it did not note when the announcement was first made. An OceanGate spokesperson on Thursday confirmed in an email to USA TODAY that the announcement was first posted on Sunday. People on board of the submersible when it imploded included OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush; British billionaire explorer Hamish Harding; French maritime and Titanic expert Paul Henri-Nargeolet; and one of the richest men in Pakistan, Shahzada Dawood, and his son, Suleman Dawood. The Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the accident and Marine Board of Investigation Chair Capt. Jason Neubauer said in a statement last week there is still ""a substantial amount of work"" investigators must do to understand what led to the implosion and prevent a similar accident from occurring in the future. Though OceanGate is based in the U.S., OceanGate Expeditions, a related company that led the Titan’s dives to the Titanic, is registered in the Bahamas. The Coast Guard said the Titan submersible “was not a U.S. flagged vessel and was never certified or certificated by the U.S. Coast Guard.""

USA TODAY,'The Lincoln Lawyer' star Manuel García-Rulfo can't relate to Mickey Haller: 'I'm kind of shy',2023-07-06 19:12:11,Pamela Avila,"Manuel García-Rulfo, star of Netflix's ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" is no Mickey Haller off screen. Charismatic, yes. Flashy and arrogant? Not quite, he insists. ""I don’t think I’m like Mickey at all."" Which is why it's so fun to play the role, he tells USA TODAY. ""I'm kind of shy, and this character allows me to use a part of me that is not (like) that."" The actor (""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" ""A Man Called Otto""), 42, portrays the big-shot Los Angeles lawyer running a law practice out of the backseat of a sleek Lincoln, taking on cases big and small from all over the city. Season 2 of Netflix's ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" (first five episodes now streaming; five more due Aug. 3) picks up after Mickey's comeback case: defending a high-profile tech billionaire accused of murdering his wife, a client left to him after the defense attorney he worked for was also murdered. García-Rulfo says Season 2 − loosely based on author Michael Connelly's 2011 novel ""The Fifth Witness,"" the fourth book of ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" series − is ""funny, intense and exciting. You find Mickey at the top of the world on magazine covers; he’s the hottest lawyer in LA at the moment. Season 2 will have viewers on the edge of their seats."" Spoilers! 'The Lincoln Lawyer' Season 2 ending unpacked: Is Lisa guilty? Who's buried by the cilantro? Mickey's at the peak of his career and in a good place mentally after a surfing accident that left him with an opioid addiction. He and his ex-wife, Maggie (Neve Campbell), and daughter, Hayley (Krista Warner), are working through complicated familial dynamics, and Mickey may have even met a new love interest in Lisa (Lana Parrilla), a chef who wins his heart with her flan dessert. But it's not long until the gavel strikes again. ""Success sometimes is really bad and it blinds you, and I think that’s what happens to him,"" García-Rulfo says. ""He just feels powerful,"" letting it cloud his judgment in the courtroom and miss clues he wouldn't have otherwise. Despite Mickey's ""cockiness"" in taking up another murder case after vowing he wouldn't, García-Rulfo admires the vulnerable and ""humane"" aspects of his character. ""It just feels very real,"" he says. ""With a character like that, you start learning so much from them or from their mistakes, in this case."" USA TODAY's Season 1 review: Netflix's 'The Lincoln Lawyer' is the perfectly average TV show we need right now The backdrop of Los Angeles' melting pot, and the organic way Mickey's Mexican American identity is portrayed, explains why ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" created by David E. Kelley, has ""been very well received, and not just with the Latino community but with everybody."" (Season 1 premiered in May 2022 and held a firm spot on Netflix's Global Top 10 with a cumulative 260.53 million hours viewed within a few weeks.) In Connelly's books, Mickey was born and raised in LA by his trial lawyer father and his mother, who was a Mexican actress. García-Rulfo was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, and has lived in LA for more than a decade. Spoilers: ‘Lincoln Lawyer’ star Manuel Garcia-Rulfo dishes on bombshell evidence in Lisa’s case Netflix's return to the books' roots after Matthew McConaughey's unconventional take in the 2011 film ""Lincoln Lawyer,"" and the challenge of embodying the role, were important for García-Rulfo. ""He can go to Beverly Hills and be around rich people or be around cholos and bikers, and he blends in really, really well. And I love that aspect,"" he says, quoting McConaughey, who called Mickey ""a guy that dances in the rain without getting wet.""

USA TODAY,Princess cruise ship hits dock in San Francisco,2023-07-06 20:38:51,Nathan Diller,"A Princess Cruises ship hit a dock at Pier 27 in San Francisco Thursday morning. The line’s Ruby Princess vessel “made unexpected contact” with the dock at 6:05 a.m. local time on arrival at the Port of San Francisco, a Princess spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “There were no injuries and at no time were any guests or crew in danger,” the spokesperson said. “The ship is safely alongside and disembarkation is complete.” The ship was returning from a round-trip sailing to Alaska that departed on June 26, according to CruiseMapper. ""I noticed we were spinning pretty quick, to be that close to the dock, and I was mid-ship, portside, looked out the window and we smacked into the dock,"" passenger Paul Zasso told the Bay Area’s ABC7 News. Cruise insurance: Should you buy it through a cruise line? Maybe not, experts say The Princess spokesperson said an assessment of the damage to the vessel and pier were underway. While the departure time of its next voyage “is still being determined,” embarkation began at 11:30 a.m. local time. The incident is not the only one of its kind in recent years. MSC Cruises’ MSC Opera ship hit a dock and tourist river boat in Venice, Italy in 2019 and Norwegian Cruise Line’s Norwegian Epic crashed into a dock in San Juan, Puerto Rico earlier that year.

USA TODAY,Are you single? Try the triangle method.,2023-07-06 11:01:34,David Oliver,"Look into someone's right eye. Yes, just their right. Now their left. Now at their lips. Congratulations, you've just tried ""the triangle method,"" a flirting ritual you might've seen on TikTok or otherwise been doing yourself without realizing. While flirting can be fun – and there's nothing wrong with trying to communicate your desires – be careful not to ""hack"" your way into seducing someone, either, dating experts say. Being yourself is likely the best way to win someone over. ""Many life hacks promise the ability to shortcut human behavior,"" says Kimberly Vered Shashoua, licensed clinical social worker. ""People are often more complicated than these hacks imply."" There's no sugar-coating the truth: Dating is messy, and everyone shows up with their own baggage. ""Even if we taken time to heal, we're still wounded and bruised from what we've gone through before and from not measuring up to society,"" says Zakiya M. Knighten, relationship strategist. Someone may easily feel like their flirting game in particular isn't measuring up. All the more reason to try the triangle method as a means of shaking up the norm. ""I find that sometimes people are afraid of trying new flirting techniques because they don't want to look like they're trying too hard or they don't want to get shot down but you have to risk to get any reward – and this is also true in dating,"" says Damona Hoffman, host of The Dates & Mates Podcast. ""Since time immemorial, humans have used eye contact to communicate. It's only in very recent years as we have all been so tied to our phones that looking at your screen feels more comfortable than looking at another person."" Does the triangle method actually work? It can signal interest for sure, and boost your confidence in the process. It also helps those who feel awkward at flirting practice communication. ""The triangle method is super fun – you feel sexy and the person you're flirting with feels the hot jolt of your attention,"" says Joey Garcia, relationship expert. Hoffman adds: ""Eye contact is one of the key elements of flirting. Making appropriate eye contact releases neurotransmitters that allow someone to feel safe. On the other hand, creepy eye contact triggers the bodies fight, flight or freeze responses. That is why the triangle method is so effective. It gives singles a framework for how to replicate appropriate eye contact."" This tactic aids in communication on dates, where someone darting their eyes elsewhere could signal a lack of interest. ""I believe that the triangle method improves communication, because it keeps things between the two of you by keeping the focal point on the actual date,"" Knighten says. In case you missed: The 'three-month rule' and the signs your relationship won't make it Before using the triangle method out in the wild, consider whether you're, to paraphrase ""The Bachelor"" franchise, in it ""for the right reasons."" ""I'd be cautious about any 'seduction hack' that promises the secret to winning over your crush,"" Vered Shashoua says. ""Most of these hacks, like the triangle method, originated in pick-up-artist spaces."" ""Instead of seeking out seduction hacks, you'd be better off working on your confidence and just talking to more people,"" Vered Shashoua adds. That said, seduction doesn't have to be something negative. ""Seduction is not a bad thing, in my view, just depends on how you use what happens after seduction,"" Knighten says. Plus, ""I don't think using body language is manipulative or wrong,"" Hoffman adds. ""The majority of our communication is nonverbal so using eye contact to convey interest is an excellent shortcut to building connection."" Here's to trying something new, if you're so inclined.

You're not alone.",3795,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/07/06/the-triangle-method-flirting-dating/70360375007/,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/video-thumbnails/9358c5cc-fa74-4965-b6b3-a764af79ebf1_poster.jpg,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SY6y2UDBYYuKUPjSwFXbegHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,congratulation imply reason behavior ritual wound response element kimberly win promise relationship expert shake strategist tiktok body lip sexy secret rule neurotransmitter view practice wrong paraphrase creepy key negative release happy fun game originate flirt freeze realize consider dart contact framework particular worker messy cautious measure hoffman careful society sign talk podcast trigger shashoua fight inclined life year hard lack lady boost damona single comfortable convey communicate interest triangle afraid tactic person social zakiya case bruise bachelor majority jolt crush make knighten flight excellent hand aid vered eye desire hot awkward seduce instead appropriate tie recent safe effective clinical believe garcia work license heal actual date add replicate find phone complicate improves super signal easily building risk focal host ability seek joey feel confidence method technique seduction process depends norm wild screen manipulative space connection baggage point attention give left time miss mate nonverbal hack shot truth show immemorial language shortcut reward human franchise communication,0.99585,0.23715415019762845,7.34086274509804,0.5856315619246655,1
USA TODAY,"Flailing DeSantis campaign leans into anti-LGBTQ ad, tries to out-cruel Trump",2023-07-06 21:10:20,Rex Huppke,"I’m not one to give Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis advice, aside from, “Consider returning to the swamp from whence you came.” But I will offer one suggestion to aid his flailing GOP presidential primary campaign: Fire everyone advising you. That probably wouldn’t be enough to help the governor defeat former President Donald Trump, the candidate riding a wave of indictments to likely victory in the former party of law and order. But it might at least ease the embarrassment DeSantis is experiencing. Last week, the Florida governor’s campaign shared a bizarre and staggeringly homophobic online ad that criticized Trump’s past comments showing support for the LGBTQ community and called the former president “the politician who did more than any other Republican to celebrate” Pride Month. See, that's supposed to be an insult. The ad then flexed DeSantis’ anti-LGBTQ muscles, celebrating with headlines about the governor signing “the most extreme slate of anti-trans laws in modern history” and a commentator noting that Florida’s laws “literally threaten trans existence.” See, that's supposed to be a compliment. Interspersing shots of muscle-bound men with thumping club music, the ad, like DeSantis himself, was both cruel and cringingly weird, and it was swiftly panned by Democrats, Trump supporters and the conservative LGBT group Log Cabin Republicans. So what did DeSantis do? On Wednesday, he doubled down on the ad, saying on a streaming show: “Identifying Donald Trump as really being a pioneer in injecting gender ideology into the mainstream, where he was having men compete against women in his beauty pageants – I think that’s totally fair game, because he’s now campaigning saying the opposite.” For those who aren’t fluent in “overly-online anti-woke warrior” speak that means … heck, I don’t really know what that means. What I do know is suggesting Trump is a friend to transgender people or the broader LGBTQ community is ludicrous, and anyone tossing around the term “gender ideology” needs to go to their room. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung responded to DeSantis’ comment, telling NBC News: “A desperate DeSanctus campaign, with a flailing candidate, in its last throes of relevancy.” GOP fearmongering campaign: Why is America not the lawless, gun-free, socialist wasteland Republicans warned us about? It absolutely pains me to say this, but Trump’s campaign is right. DeSantis, DeSanctus or “DerpSantis,” as I like to call him, is several steps beyond desperate. For starters, his advisers must have looked at how Trump’s brash bullying and overall cruelty worked out for Republicans in the past three national elections (a midterm, the 2020 presidential election then another midterm), and said: “Here’s the solution. We need to run to the right of this guy who keeps losing, and be more cruel!” That’s when they all should’ve been fired. They weren’t, so now, after sharing one of the most bizarre and offensive presidential ads in recent memory, DeSantis’ genius advisers apparently said: “Let’s lean into that ad in a way that somehow, defying all logic, makes one of the most objectively loathsome politicians on earth look slightly sympathetic while making you look like an absolute monster!” If I didn’t know better, I’d say the DeSantis campaign is run by a bunch of Trump lackeys savoring the chance to drive it into a ditch. Losing already? Maybe Ron DeSantis' flailing presidential campaign caught 'woke mind virus.' Here’s a simple fact: You can’t out-mean Trump, and even if you could, independent, Democratic and even moderate Republican voters outside Florida have made it abundantly clear they aren’t interested in governing-by-bully. According to national polling averages by FiveThirtyEight, DeSantis started the year at 37%. He’s now at 23%, and the governor saw no polling bump to speak of when he formally announced his campaign. He’s getting trounced by a candidate who has now been charged with more than 70 felonies. Whoever thinks DeSantis can get out of his present morass by posting alt-right-meme-filled videos touting his draconian attacks on marginalized people has been spending too much time huffing swamp fumes. DeSantis is a derpy candidate, like an animatronic robot programmed to appear unfamiliar with and annoyed by the ways of humans while repeating the word “woke” every seven seconds. But his campaign is, remarkably, even worse, with its embrace of a bizarro-world anti-LGBTQ ad a perfect case in point. The whole mess is a tent shy of a circus. And it’s poised to make Jeb Bush’s agonizingly limp 2016 bid for the presidency look like a memorable powerhouse. (Please clap.)

USA TODAY,Musk vs. Zuckerberg Threads throwdown: Twitter threatening to sue over Twitter 'killer',2023-07-06 19:58:45,Jessica Guynn,"The tech billionaire cage match between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk just leapt out of the ring and into the courtroom. Twitter is threatening to sue Meta, accusing the Facebook and Instagram parent company of poaching Twitter employees and pilfering trade secrets to build its “Twitter killer” app. On Wednesday Meta debuted Threads, a text-based social media app that mimics Twitter in look and feel. Twitter lawyer Alex Spiro fired back, alleging “systematic, willful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property.” In the letter to Meta CEO Zuckerberg obtained by news outlet Semafor, Spiro alleged Meta hired dozens of former Twitter employees with access to “Twitter’s trade secrets and other highly confidential information.” “Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,” Spiro wrote. In a statement, Meta spokesman Andy Stone denied Spiro’s charges. “No one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee – that’s just not a thing,” he said. Twitter replied to a request for comment from USA TODAY with an automated poop emoji. Musk, the company's executive chairman, tweeted: ""Competition is fine, cheating is not."" University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias says Meta will have to take seriously Musk’s threat to sue. The company's tendency to copy popular features from competitors could be subject to legal challenge, he said. And litigation could be costly and a distraction as Meta tries to take market share from Twitter with Threads. Threads is essentially a text-based version of Instagram. It uses your Instagram username and automatically follows the same people you already follow on your Instagram account. You can then customize your profile for Threads.

Mark Rightmire/MediaNews Group via Getty Images hide caption Alan Hostetter, seen here in May 2020, became a leading activist against coronavirus-related lockdown policies in Orange County, Calif. Hostetter, a former police chief and yoga instructor, was convicted of conspiring to obstruct congress' certification of the 2020 presidential election results at the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. A retired California police chief, who led pro-Trump protests and called for ""traitors"" in government to be ""executed as an example,"" was sentenced to 135 months — just over 11 years — in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. After representing himself at his trial earlier this year, Alan Hostetter was convicted of conspiring to obstruct Congress' certification of Joe Biden's electoral victory, bringing a hatchet onto Capitol grounds, and disorderly conduct. While Hostetter joined the mob on the steps of the Capitol, he stopped short of entering the building and did not assault police officers during the riot. ""This defendant's conduct was terrorism,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mariano, who argued that Hostetter's lengthy career in law enforcement meant he should have known better. ""Through his words and deeds on Jan. 6, Alan Hostetter was a terrorist,"" Mariano said. ""Nothing he did was patriotic."" Hostetter denied wrongdoing and gave a lengthy conspiratorial rant claiming that the Capitol riot was the result of a ""false flag"" attack engineered by the federal government. ""I have full faith and confidence the truth will come out and when it does it will shock people,"" Hostetter told the court. He also praised Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy for saying at Wednesday's GOP primary debate that the Jan. 6 riot ""now does look like it was an inside job."" At one point in his remarks to the court, Hostetter endorsed a baseless fringe theory that the fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed by a police officer while attempting to breach a locked door in the Capitol, was ""staged."" ""She wasn't actually killed that day,"" Hostetter said. That claim angered Babbitt's mother, Micki Witthoeft, who attended the hearing. Witthoeft confronted Hostetter outside the courtroom, calling him ""arrogant"" and telling him ""you need help."" The Department of Justice had asked Judge Royce Lamberth to sentence Hostetter to just over 12 years in prison, arguing that his violent anti-government rhetoric, carrying of dangerous weapons, and extensive planning merited a harsh punishment. At Alan Hostetter's trial, federal prosecutors introduced a photo of gear they alleged Hostetter brought to Washington, D.C. ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. U.S. Department of Justice hide caption Many participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot took unusual paths to the storming of the Capitol, but few were as singular as Hostetter's. Hostetter served in the U.S. Army in the 1980s and deployed to Germany before going on to work for the Orange County Sheriff's Department and ultimately becoming police chief of La Habra, Calif. After he retired from that position due to what he said were spinal problems, Hostetter settled in the small beachside community of San Clemente and became a yoga instructor and sound healer. He posted videos of himself playing a gong in front of a sunset, and rhapsodizing about the search for inner peace. After the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, Hostetter began leading protests against what he viewed as tyrannical government overreach, and spoke in terms of violent anti-government revolution. He founded a nonprofit called the American Phoenix Project to support his protest efforts, and gained traction in Southern California's right-wing political scene, standing out with his signature trilby hat and goatee. Hostetter appeared at events with Republican politicians and partnered with the law firm of a prominent Republican attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, to challenge California's COVID-19 policies in court. Throughout his case, Hostetter has appeared to endorse a wide range of baseless conspiracy theories while arguing that he is the target of a longstanding government plot. At times, he has referenced the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy alongside claims about the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the firing of Tucker Carlson from Fox News and the Freemasons. After the 2020 election, Hostetter and his group turned their focus to rejecting Biden's electoral victory. ""President Trump must be inaugurated on January 20th, and he must be allowed to finish this historic job of cleaning out the corruption in the cesspool known as Washington, D.C.,"" Hostetter said in a speech in Huntington Beach, Calif. in Dec. 2020. ""The enemies and traitors of America, both foreign and domestic, must be held accountable. And they will. There must be long prison terms, while execution is the just punishment for the ringleaders of this coup."" Prosecutors say that Hostetter then ""spent weeks rallying others, collecting weapons, and planning an attack on the U.S. Capitol on the day that the peaceful transfer of power was meant to take place."" Key evidence against Hostetter came from one of his co-defendants, a California man named Russell Taylor. He helped plan protests with Hostetter, and joined Hostetter in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 while armed with a knife, body armor and a stun baton. Taylor pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, cooperated with prosecutors and testified against his former friend. Hostetter continued to dispute Taylor's testimony at his sentencing hearing. In wrapping his remarks, he thanked Judge Lamberth for allowing him to speak at length about his case. ""You always have given me the opportunity to flap my gums,"" Hostetter told the court.",6216,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217719303/former-police-chief-turned-yoga-teacher-sentenced-to-11-years-over-jan-6-riot,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/12/06/gettyimages-1233381362_wide-e843324736c4baa9181b2667fc61c766965baa3b-s1100-c50.jpeg,Politics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police historic carlson army length enter short confront tyrannical patriotic sound settle retire fire participant unusual weapon beach breach assassination singular american trial charge stop ahead armor wide long dispute continued firm nonprofit sentence power body corruption courtroom defendant angered project argue full view overreach enforcement primary effort electoral clemente vivek assault hostetter front represent assistant law deed allege day endorse lock storm meant told transfer execution ashli key mother america knife extensive fox san harmeet praise wednesday instructor conspiracy spinal department biden carry begin stag partner deny evidence due terrorism john career event mob california false wrongdoing video fatal role small political baton rhapsodize southern gear stand fringe ringleader spoke conduct royce dhillon scene republican congress finish play candidate trilby coup execute peace reference turn obstruct arrogant former remark search conspiratorial traitor bring year shoot spent claim stun step post shock rhetoric disorderly held attend orange result healer found cesspool january introduce prosecutor official gong thanked inside lengthy cooperate september sunset speech gum justice case dangerous babbitt politician hide harsh kill lamberth range guilty attack photo russell rant witthoeft judge peaceful planning proceed chief court punishment yoga victory policy foreign caption flag early lockdown opportunity plan alan certification freemason work terrorist county mark path support friend president month job convict germany beachside attorney gop group prison presidential debate pandemic building term ground week lead plead trump serve place join conspire wrap image goatee challenge enemy micki confidence speak longstanding word focus collect position earlier federal inaugurate revolution kennedy traction alongside taylor baseless point cleaning give government accountable protest habra sheriff plot hatchet time capitol joe brought washington huntington hit domestic violent truth news target engineer problem prominent testify testimony getty ultimately qanon rally mariano election faith deployed signature phoenix theory arm hearing tucker ramaswamy anthony attempt merit community call reject riot officer activist flap,-0.99585,0.33783783783783783,10.342292213473318,0.3976744186046512,0

Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption Police officers keep watch Thursday near the scene outside Frank and Estella Beam Hall, where the Lee Business School is located, the morning after a shooting left three dead at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus. A gunman who opened fire at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on Wednesday killed three faculty members and left one injured, the university said. On Thursday, the university identified two of the victims as Patricia Navarro-Velez, 39, of Las Vegas and Cha Jan ""Jerry"" Chang, 64, of Henderson, Nev. — both professors in the business school. The third person killed, also a faculty member, will be identified after relatives have been notified, the university said. It said another faculty member, who was not identified, remains hospitalized. At a news conference Thursday, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill identified the shooting suspect as 67-year-old Anthony Polito. McMahill told reporters that officials had been able to search Polito's car and house but haven't pinned down the motive for the shooting. ""I want to stress that we're still learning a lot about this suspect and still trying to understand the motive,"" McMahill said. ""We know he applied numerous times for a job with several Nevada higher education institutions and was denied each time."" McMahill added that Polito had a list of people he was seeking on the UNLV campus, as well as faculty from East Carolina University, where he had once worked. The sheriff told reporters that police had contacted all the individuals on that list to make sure they were OK, with the exception of one individual who was on an international flight. Before the shooting, Polito had sent letters to various UNLV personnel across the country with no return address, McMahill said. He told reporters that law enforcement officials still do not know the content of all the letters, but he said that at least one of them had an ""unknown white powder substance"" in it. McMahill said that officials are currently processing those envelopes and urged that if anybody in the education sector receives a letter with no return address that is taped, they should proceed with caution and contact their local authorities. The Associated Press reported that Polito, who was killed in a shootout with law enforcement, did not appear to be targeting students, according to two law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the investigation. ""What students, employees, and campus visitors endured yesterday during the shooting and the tense aftermath is life-changing,"" UNLV President Keith Whitfield said in a statement. ""My heart breaks for the families, friends, and loved ones of Dr. Navarro and Dr. Chang, and for all of the victims of this senseless act of violence that has physically and emotionally affected so many,"" he also stated. ""During this time, it's especially important for all of us to be there for each other and I am committed to doing all I can for all of our students and staff – to listen, to comfort, and to let them know we care deeply about them and their wellbeing."" It was just six years ago and a few miles west that Las Vegas experienced the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, when a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest country music festival, claiming the lives of 60 people. Wednesday's shooting started around 11:45 a.m. local time on the fourth floor of the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. It ended outside, with two university detectives fatally shooting the gunman. The Associated Press reported that Polito was a professor who had recently been rejected for a job at the school. For the roughly 40 minutes between the first shots and the all-clear, the campus waited in a state of unease, apprehension and terror.

Ronda Churchill/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Parents Mabel Fontanilla and Raul Villalonga embrace following the shooting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus on Wednesday. Law student Carlos Eduardo Espina, 24, had just finished one of his last final exams when his classroom received the alerts of an active shooter. ""At first it didn't seem real. And then you just say, 'Oh s***. It's my turn, I guess,'"" he told NPR by phone on Wednesday evening. ""That's just the way it's going. This is happening more and more often."" Since the start of this year, more than 630 mass shootings have claimed lives across the U.S., according to the Gun Violence Archive. One poll released this year found that half of Americans have been impacted by gun violence — 1 in 6 say they've personally witnessed a shooting. It was only last week that Espina stood in a crowd to watch a Christmas parade and wondered aloud to his girlfriend not whether, but when, he would get swept up in some kind of mass shooting, he said. ""It's not gonna be the last time,"" he predicted on Wednesday. ""I wouldn't be surprised if there's another, something like this, I don't know, within a few days or weeks. That's just how things are nowadays."" When UNLV alerted students to the shooting on social media, the warning included the phrase ""This is not a test,"" followed by what has become the standby survival advice: ""RUN-HIDE-FIGHT."" Ph.D. student Kathryn Henry said it felt like the city's history with tragedy at least left campus authorities more prepared to respond again. When the shooting started, she was on the other end of campus, ordering a bagel in the campus recreation center. The next thing she knew, she was swept into a locker room with roughly 100 other people and spent the next two hours sheltering in place. ""Nobody panicked,"" she said. ""They were all very calm. They were very professional. You could tell the drills had worked."" But even the highest levels of preparedness couldn't insulate her from the fear. When NPR spoke to Henry on Wednesday evening, she was still waiting to hear back from friends, students and colleagues, checking her phone and email for confirmation that everyone was safe. Police stressed that the death toll would've been far higher if the officers had responded with less speed. It's unclear how many of the 30,000 students were on campus on Wednesday, but McMahill said a group of students had gathered outside the business school building at the time of the shooting, marking the end of the term with picnics and games. UNLV's 332-acre campus is less than 4 miles from the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, where a 64-year-old gunman opened fire from a hotel window on Oct. 1, 2017, targeting a crowd of thousands attending the open-air Route 91 Harvest country music concert below. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mandalay Bay's parent company, MGM Resorts, thanked first responders who ""once again"" acted with courage and speed. The Park MGM Las Vegas hotel was one of several resorts along the Vegas Strip that lit up its marquee with what has become a familiar phrase: #VegasStrong. That hashtag, which trended in the days following 2017's shooting, once again was among the most shared phrases on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday. But this time, some of those sharing the hashtag are saying they don't want to feel strong; they just want to feel safe. i am 22 years old. today is the third time in my life i’ve had to hide in a locked classroom because of an active shooter threat on a school campus. when will america change? #UNLV #VegasStrong Rachel Weese, who works as a research coordinator at the school, shared the #VegasStrong hashtag alongside a post explaining that Wednesday's shooting marked the third time she has had to hide in a locked classroom because of the threat of an active shooter.

NPR,Hunter Biden is indicted on federal tax charges,2023-12-07 21:08:00,Washington Desk,"The special counsel investigating Hunter Biden, the president's son, charged him on nine counts related to his failure to pay federal taxes on millions of dollars of income. A federal grand jury in the Central District of California returned the indictment charging Hunter Biden with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor tax offenses. The charges stem from special counsel David Weiss' long-running investigation into the president's son. The indictment alleges that from tax years 2016 through 2019, Hunter Biden didn't pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes, and that he filed false returns for tax year 2018 in order to evade the assessment of taxes. The indictment alleges that the president's son ""subverted the payroll and tax withholding process of his own company by withdrawing millions outside of the payroll and tax withholding process; spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills; in 2018, stopped paying his outstanding and overdue taxes for tax year 2015; willfully failed to pay his 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 taxes on time, despite having access to funds to pay some or all of these taxes; willfully failed to file his 2017 and 2018 tax returns, on time; and when he did finally file his 2018 returns, included false business deductions in order to reduce the very substantial tax liability he faced as of February 2020."" If convicted, Hunter Biden faces a maximum penalty of 17 years in prison, though actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. Thursday's development comes months after a plea deal with prosecutors – in which the president's son agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor offenses related to his filing of federal income taxes and enter a pretrial diversion agreement related to a felony firearm offense in order to avoid prosecution – fell apart. At the time, the judge in the case demanded that the lawyers from both sides make clear that the deal does not convey broad immunity offered to Biden from prosecution on his business dealings. Hunter Biden subsequently pleaded not guilty to the two misdemeanor offenses related to his filing of federal income taxes. That previous indictment alleges that Hunter Biden did not pay federal income taxes for either 2017 or 2018, despite owing more than $100,000 in taxes each year. House Republicans have raised questions about what they say are Hunter Biden's questionable business dealings, and have made him a key part of their impeachment inquiry into the president, though there is no evidence yet of illegal activity on the part of the president. Still, the controversy surrounding the younger Biden does appear to be registering with the public. An NPR poll from early October shows that 63% of respondents believe President Biden has done something unethical or illegal in relation to his son's business dealings. The split is along partisan lines: Nine in 10 Republicans think Biden's done something wrong. Only 1 in 3 Democrats do.",3029,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1218054174/hunter-biden-is-indicted-on-federal-tax-charges,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/12/06/gettyimages-1267429364_sq-f05138425c32ef6c731c976f4f996cc8e4a299e9-s100-c15.jpg,Politics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,hunter assessment respondent despite raise withdraw central enter jury owe impeachment dollar questionable penalty firearm investigation offense case return liability deduction line public guilty tax judge broad make prosecutor side special charge stop willfully fail subvert illegal unethical sentence early reduce lawyer access substantial subsequently believe stem previous offer company president month actual maximum convict question npr partisan relation wrong deal part plea withholding prison david pretrial prosecution failure key demand immunity surround plead poll crime misdemeanor bill finally file inquiry avoid biden dealing evidence extravagant process pay federal felony include controversy california false fund activity overdue outstanding october february million income fell order time thursday republican young agree diversion house split evade show agreement wei filing count development register year spent alleges indictment payroll investigate related business district convey counsel typically clear lifestyle grand democrat,-0.98635,0.19808517662594916,10.611605839416058,0.49114974937343353,0
NPR,House votes to censure Rep. Jamaal Bowman for pulling fire alarm,2023-12-08 01:33:00,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON — House members voted again Thursday to punish one of their own, targeting Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman for triggering a fire alarm in a U.S. Capitol office building when the chamber was in session. The Republican censure resolution passed with a few Democratic votes, but most of the party stood by Bowman in opposition of an effort they said lacked credibility and integrity. The prominent progressive now becomes the third Democratic House member to be admonished this year through the censure process, which is a punishment one step below expulsion from the House. ""It's painfully obvious to myself, my colleagues and the American people that the Republican Party is deeply unserious and unable to legislate,"" Bowman said Wednesday as he defended himself during floor debate. ""Their censure resolution against me today continues to demonstrate their inability to govern and serve the American people."" The 214-191 vote to censure Bowman caps nearly a year of chaos and retribution in the House of Representatives. Since January, the chamber has seen the removal of a member from a committee assignment, the first ouster of a speaker in history and, just last week, the expulsion of a lawmaker for only the third time since the Civil War. Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., who introduced the censure resolution, defended it, claiming Bowman pulled the alarm in September to ""cause chaos and the stop the House from doing its business"" as lawmakers scrambled to pass a bill to fund the government before a shutdown deadline. ""It is reprehensible that a Member of Congress would go to such lengths to prevent House Republicans from bringing forth a vote to keep the government operating and Americans receiving their paychecks,"" McClain said in a statement. Bowman pleaded guilty in October to a misdemeanor count for the incident, which took place in the Cannon House Office Building. He agreed to pay a $1,000 fine and serve three months of probation, after which the false fire alarm charge is expected to be dismissed from his record under an agreement with prosecutors. The fire alarm prompted a buildingwide evacuation when the House was in session and staffers were working in the building. The building was reopened an hour later after Capitol police determined there was no threat. Bowman apologized and said that at the time he was trying to get through a door that was usually open but was closed that day because it was the weekend. Many progressive Democrats, who spoke in his defense, called the Republican effort to censure him ""unserious,"" and the accused those across the aisle of weaponizing the censure process against Democrats over and over again for political gain. ""Censure me next. That's how worthless your effort is,"" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the floor late Wednesday. ""It has no credibility. No integrity. No legitimacy. Censure me next, and I'll take that censure and I'll wear it next week, next month, next year like a badge of honor."" The vote is the latest example of how the chamber has begun to deploy punishments like censure, long viewed as a punishment of last resort, routinely and often in strikingly partisan ways. ""Under Republican control, this chamber has become a place where trivial issues get debated passionately and important ones not at all,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said during floor debate. ""Republicans have focused more on censuring people in this Congress than passing bills that help people we represent or improving this country in any way."" While the censure of a lawmaker carries no practical effect, it amounts to severe reproach from colleagues, as lawmakers who are censured are usually asked to stand in the well of the House as the censure resolution against them is read aloud. Bowman is now the 27th person to be censured by the chamber — and the third just this year. Last month, Republicans voted to censure Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan in an extraordinary rebuke of her rhetoric about the Israel-Hamas war. In June, Democrat Adam Schiff of California was censured for comments he made several years ago about investigations into then-President Donald Trump's ties to Russia.",4183,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/08/1218095236/house-censure-rep-jamaal-bowman-fire-alarm,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police country length alarm record investigation rashida continue russia pull fire threat amount american stop charge improve long close michigan worthless weaponize paycheck tlaib view effort inability govern open effect represent partisan passionately receive day democratic unable extraordinary ouster lisa rebuke bill wednesday defend colleague buildingwide carry cap begin shutdown false california painfully prevent deadline late political routinely history october floor hakeem stand spoke adam republican congress agree retribution staffer trigger ago speaker jeffries accuse resort opposition admonish bring civil year lack claim cannon step trivial rhetoric passing member punish deeply schiff january introduce prosecutor reopen leader september person chaos june assignment defense removal probation operating guilty party make unserious punishment demonstrate censure expect session stood tie mcclain reprehensible hour weekend work obvious determine wear month lawmaker comment honor reproach mcgovern debate building chamber incident week plead trump misdemeanor serve place control legitimacy representative scramble progressive legislate aisle focus aloud vote process pay fund jamaal important government severe strikingly thursday time capitol statement issue washington house office credibility today target badge prominent expulsion agreement donald integrity count deploy practical bowman fine evacuation business resolution prompt apologize read call pass dismiss democrat committee,-0.94825,0.0,9.898704663212435,0.3984848484848485,0

He went topside to see the USS Utah capsizing and Japanese planes in the air. He scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun up above. He remembers being only 140 pounds (63.50 kilograms) as a 21-year-old, but somehow finding the strength to lift boxes weighing almost twice that. ""We were pretty startled. Startled and scared to death,"" Schab, now 103, said. ""We didn't know what to expect and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it."" Eighty-two years later, Schab returned to Pearl Harbor Thursday on the anniversary of the attack to remember the more than 2,300 servicemen killed. He was one of five survivors at a ceremony commemorating the assault that propelled the United States into World War II. Six of the increasingly frail men had been expected, but one was not feeling well, organizers said. The aging pool of Pearl Harbor survivors has been rapidly shrinking.

A crowd of a few thousand invited guests and members of the public joined them in holding a moment of silence at 7:55 a.m., the same time bombs began falling decades ago. Four F-22 jets flew overhead and broke the quiet, one splitting away from the rest in a ""missing man formation"" that honored the fallen. Thursday's ceremony was held on a field across the harbor from the USS Arizona Memorial, a white structure that sits above the rusting hull of the battleship, which exploded in a fireball and sank shortly after being hit. More than 1,100 sailors and Marines from the Arizona were killed and more than 900 are entombed inside. David Kilton, the National Park Service's interpretation, education and visitor services lead for Pearl Harbor, noted that for many years survivors frequently volunteered to share their experiences with visitors to the historic site. That's not possible anymore. ""We could be the best storytellers in the world and we can't really hold a candle to those that lived it sharing their stories firsthand,"" Kilton said. ""But now that we are losing that generation and won't have them very much longer, the opportunity shifts to reflect even more so on the sacrifices that were made, the stories that they did share.""

U.S. Navy/via AP hide caption The destroyer USS Shaw explodes after being hit by bombs during the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, December 7, 1941. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doesn't keep statistics for how many Pearl Harbor survivors are still living. But department data show that of the 16 million who served in World War II, only about 120,000 were alive as of October and an estimated 131 die each day. There were about 87,000 military personnel on Oahu at the time of the attack, according to a rough estimate compiled by military historian J. Michael Wenger. Schab never spoke much about Pearl Harbor until about a decade ago. He's since been sharing his story with his family, student groups and history buffs. And he's returned to Pearl Harbor several times since. The reason? ""To pay honor to the guys that didn't make it,"" he said. Harry Chandler, 102, recalled raising the flag at a mobile hospital in Aiea Heights in the hills above Pearl Harbor in 1941. He was a was a Navy hospital corpsman 3rd Class at the time. Sitting in his front row seat on the ceremony grounds overlooking the harbor on Thursday, Chandler said the memories of the USS Arizona blowing up still come back to him today. ""I saw these planes come, and I thought they were planes coming in from the states until I saw the bombs dropping,"" Chandler said. They took cover and then rode trucks down to Pearl Harbor where they attended to the injured. He remembers sailors trapped on the capsized USS Oklahoma tapping on the hull of their ship to get rescued, and caring for those who eventually got out after teams cut holes in the ship. ""I look out there and I can still see what's going on. I can still see what was happening,"" said Chandler, who today lives in Tequesta, Florida. Asked what he wants Americans to know about Pearl Harbor, he said: ""Be prepared."" ""We should have known that was going to happen. The intelligence has to be better,"" he said.

Schab's ship, the Dobbin, lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action and two died later of wounds suffered when fragments from a bomb struck the ship's stern. All had been manning an anti-aircraft gun. Marine Corps. Capt. Daniel Hower, the 29-year-old grand-nephew of Conter, the last remaining USS Arizona survivor, delivered the keynote address, reading from a podium as he faced the survivors seated in the front row, Pearl Harbor sitting still behind them beneath a light blue sky and scattered white clouds. Hower acknowledged the collective humility of their military service. ""Whenever my Uncle Lou or any other veteran of World War II is recognized or thanked for their service, they humbly answer: 'We just did what we had to do,'"" Hower said. Hower then hailed their sacrifice, determination, heroism and courage. ""The legacy that you all built remains unmatched and a lesson that keeps on teaching,"" Hower said. That Sunday morning had started peacefully for Schab. He was expecting a visit from his brother, who was also in the Navy and was assigned to a naval radio station in Wahiawa, north of Pearl Harbor. The two never did get together that day. Schab spent most of World War II in the Pacific with the Navy, going to the New Hebrides, now known as Vanuatu, and then the Mariana Islands and Okinawa. After the war, he worked on the Apollo program sending astronauts to the moon as an electrical engineer at General Dynamics. Schab has slowed down in recent years. But he still gets together each week for cocktails over Zoom with younger members of his fraternity, Delta Sigma Phi. He drinks cranberry-raspberry juice. At his age, he's thankful to still be able to return to Pearl Harbor with his family and caregivers. The family has a GoFundMe account to help them raise money for the pilgrimage. ""Just grateful that I'm still here,"" Schab said. ""That's really how it feels. Grateful.""",7540,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1218044792/centenarian-pearl-harbor-survivors-return-to-honor-those-who-were-killed-82-year,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/12/07/collage-7-6_sq-4272461df9c8860f52ec54a8cb56b4b2824d8a75-s100-c15.jpg,Politics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,slow cocktail heard visitor historic raise reason astronaut pilgrimage survivor fall send wound explode share record back hill return broke public seat mobile teach cover podium fire daughter remains jet courage kilton american sunday buff organizer fraternity scurry lose close service mariana beneath flew gofundme tap moment pearl hole happen mengshin honolulu built hail address shortly assault brother navy ship front represent humility battleship start rust put hull day decade humbly anymore remain historian deck surprise schab kilogram lift locker daisy story entombed stern hower pretty drink department volunteer station clean silence begin ammunition deliver fireball increasingly accord structure live pacific electrical sky california military candle salute drop shower experience history crowd october estimate living bomb anniversary answer splitting suffer injured spoke hebrides student lou million sits box north prepare vanuatu action zoom young site determination scatter truck apollo corp commemorate remembers hawaii guest ago light national knew life utah affair field year gun explodes overlook aboard arizona wenger spent sank shrink acknowledge michael away member held attend weigh december chain compile rest row quiet team inside thanked japanese blowing prepared reflect fragment visit struck grateful ike remember program juice hide morning strength sigma florida moon kill attack shell corpsman party chandler make formation naval possible sacrifice reading alive caption marine expect flag memorial air frail rode oklahoma storyteller opportunity lesson harbor assign okinawa heroism united recent family cloud statistic work conter tequesta collective education pound radio ceremony legacy feed blue data park death honor overhead group david find peacefully pool rough ground week lead crew shaw state grab serve join topside shift startle uniform caregiver feel uncle note remembrance invite pay thankful serviceman plane hospital island keynote capt rapidly general veteran recognize money arrive personnel world class longer phi account recall hold time thursday cut miss hit guy interpretation rescue generation propel ira today unmatched dobbin intelligence engineer frequently memory sailor show harry aiea delta capsize daniel wahiawa dynamic oahu thousand wheelchair eventually age destroyer white firsthand scar height call trap,-0.03155000000000002,0.23872679045092834,7.471679999999996,0.27373597081930406,0
NPR,Emhoff says 3 college presidents showed a 'lack of moral clarity' on antisemitism,2023-12-07 18:36:00,NPR Staff,"Second gentleman Doug Emhoff speaks during the Annual National Menorah Lighting at the White House on Dec. 7, 2023. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff said on Thursday that a ""crisis of antisemitism"" was making it difficult for many Jews in America to celebrate Hanukkah, and singled out for criticism the presidents of three elite universities for their Capitol Hill testimony this week about antisemitism on campus. Speaking at a ceremony to light the National Menorah, Emhoff cited the testimony as an example of why many Jews have felt ""feeling unmoored and afraid"" because of backlash to Israel's military response in Gaza to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania have been criticized for failing to say whether students calling for genocide would be disciplined. Liz Magill, the president of UPenn, said the issue would be ""context-dependent."" She has since apologized. ""Seeing the presidents of some of our most elite universities literally unable to denounce calling for the genocide of Jews as antisemitic — that lack of moral clarity is simply unacceptable,"" Emhoff said. ""Let me be clear. When Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or identity, and when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is antisemitism. And it must be condemned and condemned unequivocally and without context,"" he said. Since the Oct. 7 attacks, President Biden has pronounced unequivocal support for Israel while expressing concerns about civilian deaths in Gaza. But polls show a majority of Democratic voters feel like Israel's response has gone too far. Vice President Harris said on Saturday that Israel needed to do more to protect civilians in Gaza. ""Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating,"" she said. Emhoff — who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president — has led White House efforts on combating antisemitism, and earlier this year he helped unveil a plan to boost safety and security for Jewish communities. At the National Menorah lighting ceremony, he said that Hanukkah was a time to ""live out the legacy of the generations of ancestors who came before us"" and ""rededicate ourselves to embracing our faith and practicing our traditions. ""We cannot live in fear or be afraid. We must always live openly and proudly as Jews,"" he said. In his remarks, second gentleman Doug Emhoff condemned a trio of university presidents for what he called ""a lack of moral clarity"" on antisemitism during congressional testimony this week.

NPR,Pantone's color of the year is 'Peach Fuzz',2023-12-07 17:43:00,Emma Bowman,"The Pantone Color Institute named its color of the year on Thursday, declaring our need for compassion and human connection in the year ahead. According to influential color consultancy, only one shade can deliver on that front: Pantone describes the orange-pink hue as gentle, warm and cozy, subtly sensual and heartfelt. Peach Fuzz, a ""velvety peach tone"" is meant to represent ""our desire to nurture ourselves and others"" and ""whose all-embracing spirit enriches mind, body, and soul."" ""In seeking a hue that echoes our innate yearning for closeness and connection, we chose a color radiant with warmth and modern elegance. A shade that resonates with compassion, offers a tactile embrace, and effortlessly bridges the youthful with the timeless,"" said Leatrice Eiseman, Pantone's executive director, in a news release. To pick the color that will set the tone for the year ahead, Pantone considers emerging trends across a range of industries. Experts comb the entertainment industry and films in production, new artists, fashion, all areas of design, aspirational travel destinations, new lifestyles, socio-economic conditions and other influences. ""Influences may also stem from new technologies, materials, textures, and effects that impact color, relevant social media platforms, and even upcoming sporting events that capture worldwide attention,"" the company said. Pantone's colors of the year end up shaping product development and consumer decisions in fashion, industrial and interior design, product packaging and other industry areas. Pantone previously picked Viva Magenta for 2023 and Very Peri for 2022. The new, orange-pink hue brings comfort, calm and beauty to a digital world, the company said; it's modern, while also referencing the past. ""At a time of turmoil in many aspects of our lives, our need for nurturing, empathy and compassion grows ever stronger as does our imaginings of a more peaceful future. We are reminded that a vital part of living a full life is having the good health, stamina, and strength to enjoy it,"" said company vice president Laurie Pressman. We needed a color ""whose gentle lightness and airy presence lifts us into the future,"" Pressman added. Many on social media agreed with the pick, describing it as beautiful and refreshing. Others panned the color as boring, out-of-touch and unflattering. Some commentary found the peach to be reminiscent of an overplayed vintage hue. The color ""reminds me of every 90s home color decor of choice,"" one Instagram comment read. ""The world is neither peachy nor fuzzy anymore. Pity,"" another person wrote. One tongue-in-cheek critique characterized the peach as ""a very democratic shade considering it doesn't look good on anyone."" Reactions to the announcement revealed that a lot of people were expecting, even rooting for, a year of green.

NPR,"Juanita Castro, anti-communist sister of Cuban leaders Fidel and Raul, dies at 90",2023-12-07 17:04:00,The Associated Press,"MIAMI — Juanita Castro, the sister of Cuban rulers Fidel and Raúl Castro who worked with the CIA against their communist government, has died in Miami at 90. Florida had been her home since shortly after fleeing the island nearly 60 years ago. Journalist María Antonieta Collins, who co-wrote Juanita Castro's 2009 book, ""Fidel and Raúl, My Brothers. The Secret History,"" wrote on Instagram that she died on Monday. ""Juanita Castro was ahead of us on the path of life and death, exceptional woman, tireless fighter for the cause of her Cuba that I love so much,"" Collins wrote. The Cuban government and media had not mentioned her death as of Wednesday. In her book, Juanita Castro, a staunch anti-communist, wrote that she began collaborating with the CIA shortly after the United States botched the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. She had originally supported her older brothers' efforts to overthrow dictator Fulgencio Batista, raising money and buying weapons. She became disillusioned when Fidel Castro became a hard-line communist after taking power in 1959 and pushed those who disagreed out of his government. When her home in Cuba became a sanctuary for anti-communists in the early 1960s, Fidel Castro warned his sister not to get involved with the ""gusanos,"" or worms as the government called those who opposed the revolution. She said in her book that it was the wife of Brazil's ambassador to Cuba who persuaded her to meet with a CIA officer during a 1961 trip to Mexico City. She said she told the agent that she didn't want any money, and would not support any violence against her brothers or others. She said the CIA used her to smuggle messages, documents and money back into Cuba hidden inside canned goods. They communicated with her via shortwave radio, playing a waltz and a song from the opera Madame Butterfly as signals that her handlers had a message for her. She remained on the island while their mother was alive, believing that protected her from Fidel's full wrath. ""My brothers could ignore what I did or appear to ignore it so as not to hurt my mom, but that didn't mean I didn't have problems,"" she wrote. After their mother died in 1963, ""everything was becoming more dangerously complicated."" Castro fled Cuba the following year, after Raúl helped her get a visa to Mexico. She never saw her brothers again. ""I cannot longer remain indifferent to what is happening in my country,"" she told reporters upon her arrival in Mexico. ""My brothers Fidel and Raúl have made it an enormous prison surrounded by water. The people are nailed to a cross of torment imposed by international Communism."" Because her work for the CIA had been clandestine and not publicly known, many Cuban exiles feared she was a communist spy when she arrived in the U.S. a year later. She later helped found a CIA-backed nonprofit organization that worked against the Castro government. She eventually settled into a quiet life in Miami, where she ran a Little Havana pharmacy and became a respected member of the Cuban-American community. She became a U.S. citizen in 1984. Luis Zúñiga Rey, who was a political prisoner in Cuba before being expelled in 1988, said Wednesday that he met Juanita Castro during local radio interviews. ""She was serious but always kind and respectful,"" he said. ""As the sister of the Cuban dictators, she always tried to keep her family background from interfering with her fellow Cubans here in Miami."" Her opposition to Fidel Castro ""showed a lot of bravery,"" he said. ""Imagine what it is like to challenge your powerful brother and what that means at a personal level,"" he said. Fidel Castro ruled Cuba until 2008, when he turned power over to Raúl, who had been his second-in-command. Raúl Castro then spent a decade as Cuba's leader. When Fidel's serious health problems in 2006 led to street celebrations in Little Havana, Juanita Castro took no joy. He was still her brother, even though she fought against his government. ""In the same way that people are demonstrating and celebrating, I'm showing sadness. I respect the position of everyone who feels happy about his health problems, but they have to respect me also,"" she told The Associated Press. ""It's my family. It's my brothers. It doesn't matter. We are separated for political reasons, ideological reasons, but that's it."" Fidel Castro died in 2016 at 90, while Raul, 92, is living in retirement.

NPR,Advertiser backlash may pose mortal threat to Elon Musk's X,2023-12-07 16:47:00,Bobby Allyn,"In response to an advertising boycott that has been growing, Musk told companies: ""Don't advertise"" â€” before saying corporations were attempting to ""blackmail"" him with money. He used the F-word in cursing out companies that have decided to step back from the platform. Owners of embattled companies do not usually attack their customers. But Musk is different. ""That was kind of the final nail in the coffin. If he's telling you what he wants you to do, believe him,"" said Tom Hespos, who runs Abydos, an advertising consulting firm. Many advertisers have been taking Musk at his word. Since his hostile takeover of Twitter last year, Musk has cleared out more than two-thirds of the staff, including teams dedicating to policing the platform for hate speech and harassment. Musk reinstated previously banned users and made ""verified"" blue check marks available for purchase, wreaking havoc across the site as impersonators and bad actors looking to spread false posts jumped on the opportunity to have a blue check mark on their profile. The platform's algorithm supercharges posts from paid users. Musk himself created yet another controversy by endorsing an antisemitic post on X that claimed Jewish communities push hatred of white people. Musk said that this was the ""actual truth."" ""Advertisers don't want to answer questions about why are you on a platform that seems like it's a safe space for antisemitism, for hate speech,"" Hespos said. Many major corporations like Walmart, Apple, Disney and IBM have stopped advertising on X. That Musk post? He apologized for it, saying on the DealBook stage that it was like handing a ""loaded gun"" to antisemites and his enemies. Still, the damage was done, said Lou Paskalis, a former advertising executive who now helps blue-chip companies with marketing plans. ""If your CEO is on a different sheet of music than the rest of company, it really requires a lot of suspension of disbelief that those views aren't imbued in the company,"" Paskalis said. In response to Musk's recent outbursts, Paskalis said, he has fielded questions like these from top executives worried about placing ads on X: ""Could we precipitate a boycott of our products? If our products get boycotted, will the board call my CEO to task?"" But it is hard to know how much ad money has disappeared. That's because Musk took the company private, meaning its financials are no longer publicly available. But when Twitter was a public company, about 90% of its annual revenue came from advertising. Staffers at the company now say that figure is not far different today. A New York Times report, citing internal X records, said up to $75 million could be lost because of the advertiser exodus. Before Musk took over the social media platform, it was a $5 billion-a-year company. It is unclear how much revenue X is now generating in the wake of Musk's radical shake-ups. On the DealBook stage, Musk said the advertiser revolt could be lethal for the company. ""Actually what this advertising boycott is gonna do is it's gonna kill the company,"" Musk said. ""And the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company."" But what does Musk mean by kill? Bankruptcy? Will it go totally under? Will he sell it? Is he exaggerating? As is always the case with Musk, it is vexing trying to figure out the answer to the most basic questions. His ultimate intent eludes the most seasoned observers. Paskalis said there is no doubt that with reusable rockets and electric vehicles, Musk has been a business genius. But running a social media site is not something that can be solved mathematically. ""And I think that does not comport with his superpower. I'm hoping that causes him to ultimately sell the platform to someone who would be a more capable steward,"" he said. Of course, as the richest person in the world, Musk can bail out X for a very long time if he wants to. But at what point might he just want to cut his losses? Some Musk observers say probably never. He's too determined to prove something to his haters. One thing is for sure: The job of Linda Yaccarino is not getting easier. She is the former advertising executive who was tapped by Musk to be CEO of X. Her chief task is bringing fleeing advertisers back to the platform. Yaccarino's friends and associates say she is unlikely to bail on X regardless of how erratic her boss is, since she, like Musk, is known for being tenacious. ""I have texted her in the past about maybe it's time to go. And I've done it on a couple of occasions face-to-face,"" Paskalis said of her leadership role at X. ""And I'm not going to have that conversation anymore, because it has become clear she isn't going anywhere."" Musk and Yaccarino have not returned requests for comment.",4751,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217720371/elon-musk-advertisers-threat-survival-x-backlash-twitter,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Entertainment and Lifestyle,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police advertising user financials leadership hostile lot available response top record back return corporation jewish conversation generate public request owner doubt kind disbelief stop eludes major long linda vehicle ban lose basic intent firm annual ceo sheet richest embattle view antisemites consult company damage endorse told course anymore executive push vex occasion medium ultimate tom worried tenacious dedicate capable platform controversy probably tapped abydos false exodus past role advertiser antisemitism steward stage board answer private customer lou harassment figure million comport twitter wake spread site yaccarino imbue staffer texted algorithm meaning require walmart disappear former totally radical bring erratic field takeover year gun hard step reusable loss post electric report revolt clear flee hatred rest team musk person social speech associate bankruptcy case kill gon wreak attack music make solve chief hand purchase internal supercharges sell antisemitic opportunity paid plan hate recent x safe believe mark friend determine actual hespos job question reinstate different profile blackmail blue comment publicly revenue easy superpower observer season check lethal exaggerate precipitate place marketing advertise task bail havoc enemy staff bos claimed decide hater word york include grow dealbook impersonator space run coffin point previously couple money boycott world prove longer time load cut suspension hop genius curse final ibm today truth mathematically unclear verify ultimately apple create rocket jumped disney paskalis white outburst business attempt product apologize nail community call actor,-0.9895499999999999,0.3788676068196169,6.881209593326382,0.3829513387846721,0
NPR,This year's Hanukkah celebrations are tempered by Israel's war with Hamas,2023-12-07 15:15:00,Shelby Hawkins,"Thursday evening marks the start of Hanukkah. The week-long holiday commemorates the Maccabee myth, which tells the story of a family of rebels who successfully led a revolt against an oppressive, anti-Jewish Greek rule. After winning against the Greeks and re-entering their temple, the Maccabees lit a make-shift menorah with a singular vial of lamp oil. What was supposed to stay lit for one night, lasted for eight. It illustrates the miracle of light in darkness. This season, the Festival of Lights is happening as the Israel-Hamas war continues to rage on. It also comes two months after the October 7 attacks in Israel that killed at least 1,200 people. The Associated Press estimates 16,200 Palestinians have been killed so far as a result of the conflict. Because of the holiday's significance and popularity, Jewish communities all over the country are continuing to honor the occasion and acknowledge the meaning the festival holds. ""We are praying for peace first and foremost. There's a particular term called 'shalom rav' which means a great peace. We want a great peace to reign down on us, on our communities, on our families, but particularly on Israel and Gaza in this moment,"" Rabbi Fischel told NPR's Morning Edition. Washington Hebrew Congregation in Washington, D.C. will celebrate Hanukkah this year just as vibrant as any other year, but with a greater emphasis on peace and healing. Hanukkah Celebration at Washington Hebrew Congregation. Ori Hoffer hide caption Hanukkah Celebration at Washington Hebrew Congregation. One way to facilitate healing is through education, according to Rabbi Fischel. Prior to the attacks, they planned to have a five-part class on Israel centered around judicial reform. ""Of course that topic changed over,"" said Rabbi Fischel, ""We've been having around 70 people here every Monday learning from political officials, from national officials, from Jewish officials about what's going on. So one way we're approaching this is through education. There's something healing in knowing, there's something healing in education."" WHC also has physical ties to Israel. Rabbi Fischel says they're in constant communication with their sister congregation, Or Hadash, in Haifa. Or Hadash's rabbi, Na'ama Dafni-Kellen, even visited once the war broke out to check in with the Washington congregants. Rabbi Fischel said that she and her team are doing what they can to support those in need in Israel. ""We have started a fund to give relief to the kibbutzim down south that were devastated by these attacks; to raise money for an ambulance in Israel as well as to raise money for families of hostages and we have so far raised $500,000.""

And neon. ""We're actually theming our Shabbat Hanukkah with neon this year. We have not only our hannukkiyote but we're going to have glow sticks and neon lights,"" Rabbi Fischel said. ""We're telling people to wear some white as a way to say we are really bringing a ton of light into this really dark time."" ""The theme of our community this year is stand strong. It really was chosen as the theme because the community is in transition from one rabbi to another rabbi – with the idea that in this moment of transition we need to stand strong,"" said Barry Lutz, the interim rabbi at West Hollywood's Kol Ami Reform Synagogue. ""Given everything that's going on in our world, both in our country and now in Israel, it's somehow become a very fitting symbol."" Rabbi Lutz has been with his current temple for less than a year, and has been serving the Jewish community since 1984. Rabbi Barry Lutz Barry Lutz hide caption Rabbi Barry Lutz He says that while his Hanukkah celebration will look essentially the same as previous years, the prayers and messaging are slightly different. ""We have incorporated prayers and readings that recognize this moment. There's a prayer for Israel that has become a regular part of our liturgy. There's a prayer for healing for all the victims – Israeli and Palestinian alike — all the innocent victims of this conflict,"" said Rabbi Lutz. ""As we do our prayer for healing, we put up all the names of the hostages, to pray for their healing."" Hamas took over 240 hostages on October 7. Since November 24th, 110 hostages have been released. Israel has released 240 Palestinian prisoners. Nationally the U.S. has seen a rise in both antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents since the attacks. On whether growing anti-Jewish sentiment has been a topic of conversation with his congregants, Rabbi Lutz says the feeling and conversation is a familiar one. ""The community that I serve is at its core an LGBTQ community. Not only is there a heightened concern of antisemitism, but also a heightened concern of anti-LGBTQ sentiment in our country,"" he said. ""There's been a dual concern that existed before October 7th."" Lutz's advice for this year's celebrations is to promote the true meaning of the holiday and spread as much light as you can. ""When you give part of something away you have less of it, but when you share light you have more of it. How can we be a source of light?"" said Rabbi Lutz, ""All that goes along with eating latkes and jelly doughnuts and singing songs and spinning dreidels and just enjoying each other's company.""

NPR,7 in 10 U.S. adults consider themselves spiritual,2023-12-07 14:42:00,Jason DeRose,"A new study from Pew Research explores what the term ""spiritual"" means to the people who describe themselves that way. It also looks into the beliefs and practices of those who say they're ""spiritual but not religious."" In ""Spirituality Among Americans"" Pew surveyed more than 11 thousand people earlier this year and found that 7 in 10 U.S. adults describe themselves as spiritual in some way. Nearly half say they are both religious and spiritual, which is to say they participate in religious institutions as well as have personal spiritual practices or ways of thinking about the world that aren't necessarily based on a formal religious tradition. 22% of U.S. adults say they are ""spiritual but not religious."" 21% say they are neither spiritual nor religious. And 10% say they are religious but not spiritual. The U.S. religious landscape has changed in recent years, becoming significantly more diverse. While the country is still predominantly Christian, portions of Jews and Muslims have increased as well as the numbers of other religious groups including Hindus and Buddhists. But researchers have tracked an overall decline in religious affiliation, meaning fewer Americans say they are members of a specific religious group. ""Many have tried to make sense of that,"" says lead Pew researcher Becka Alper. ""Is the U.S. public becoming more secular? Are they becoming more spiritual?"" Alper says researchers wanted to get a better understanding of spiritual beliefs, practices, and experiences. Among the findings: 83% of all U.S. adults believe people have a soul or spirit in addition to their physical body. 81% say there is something spiritual beyond the natural world, even if we cannot see it. 74% say there are some things science cannot possibly explain. 45% say they have had a sudden feeling of connection with something from beyond this world. 38% say they have had a strong feeling that someone who has passed away was communicating with them from beyond this world. 30% say they have personally encountered a spirit or unseen force. When it comes to understanding what the word ""spiritual"" means, the vast majority (74%) say it means ""being connected to something bigger than myself."" 70% of those surveyed say ""spiritual"" specifically means ""being connected with God."" 64% say it means ""being connected with my true self."" Just 40% of respondents say that being spiritual means following a specific religious faith. But people also reported a variety of other understandings of the word spiritual, including being connected with nature, being connected with other people, being connected to loved ones who've died, being open minded, or simply continuing family traditions. A common thread among many of those aspects of what it means to be spiritual is the word ""connected."" One interesting finding is that the experiences of evangelical Christians (who are predominately white) and members of historically Black Protestant churches are similar. The vast majority of both groups say that they experience a deep sense of well-being at least once a month due to their spiritual beliefs and practices. That same was less true of other religious groups such as Catholics or Mainline Protestants. The Pew study gave respondents an opportunity to also describe in their own words what being spiritual means to them. The anonymous responses were wide ranging, including: ""Being one with your soul, emotions, feelings, actions."" ""Believing in something larger and more creative than science."" ""One with the universe!"" ""The belief that a supreme being is the creator of the universe, and that humans' existence in this realm is transient."" ""It means having a relationship with God and a belief system that includes a responsibility to do what is right."" Because this survey was the first time Pew asked many of these questions specifically about spirituality, it's not possible to establish any trends from the data. Rather, Alper says, ""The goal of this study is to establish a baseline."" Pew plans to continue asking these and similar questions in the coming years, which will allow them to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of religion and spirituality among Americans.",4199,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217855568/7-in-10-u-s-adults-consider-themselves-spiritual,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country interest respondent significantly responsibility understanding increase response affiliation change unseen feeling protestant majority number continue describe public baseline range encounter addition force make soul relationship american wide spirit half natural possible religion finding formal large thread supreme body opportunity similar adult plan hindu recent strong family sudden personally believe evolution religious muslim system open institution month mainline science practice question emotion realm data becka creator group tracked find study research black base landscape term love tradition lead goal participate personal church trend decline explain feel big spiritual word due earlier researcher belief diverse vast include aspect catholic anonymous establish common specific experience connection historically give evangelical world buddhist creative variety possibly time pew action universe spirituality simply deep secular predominately meaning predominantly deeper mind thousand christian faith year physical connect jew understand existence survey away follow explores white necessarily member portion specifically alper human transient report found nature pass god communicate,0.9899,0.0,9.029423558897243,0.3770680406549971,0
NPR,"CosMc's lands in Illinois, as McDonald's tests its new coffee-centered concept",2023-12-07 14:00:00,Bill Chappell,"If you were alive in the 1980s, and you're nostalgic for one of the least well-known McDonald's mascot characters, the hamburger chain's new restaurant concept is calling your name: CosMc's. The company says it first ""test site"" is opening in Illinois this month, serving up coffee, frappes and quick bites. In McDonald's lore, CosMc (it's pronounced like ""cosmic"") was a six-handed alien known for getting grabby with burgers, which he wanted to take back to his home world after visiting Earth for a ""trade mission."" In its new iteration, the beverage-first McDonald's spinoff seems to be a grab at markets currently served by the likes of Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. The menu highlights coffee and energy boosters, and it includes at least 15 syrup flavors, from caramel to prickly pear. ""Think of it as an out-of-this-world solution for the 3 p.m. slump,"" the company said on Wednesday, describing the CosMc's launch in an update to investors. The store will also sell ""McPops,"" which are essentially donut holes filled with cookie butter, hazelnut or other flavors. The sweets have been attracting fans after seemingly originating at McDonald's operations in Spain. There's just a handful of sandwiches, centering on eggs and sausage, avocados and cheese. There isn't a hamburger in sight. A sample menu shows food available at CosMc's, ranging from berry-flavored frappes to coffees and breakfast sandwiches. Courtesy McDonald's hide caption A sample menu shows food available at CosMc's, ranging from berry-flavored frappes to coffees and breakfast sandwiches. The fast-food giant says its core business is thriving, with growth of more than 30% since 2019. It wants to open thousands more stores worldwide. But the company also announced layoffs earlier this year. With its current move, McDonald's says it's looking for chances to experiment — and thus, CosMc's. ""To think ... a little over a year ago, this was just an idea. This week, we're opening the first test site,"" Chris Kempczinski, the company's president and CEO, told investors on Wednesday. While the concept seems to have come together quickly, the restaurant company also developed an elaborate backstory for CosMc. In the company's telling, the alien whisked food from McDonald's to a faraway galaxy. There, new innovations emerged — and now, more than 30 years later, CosMc has returned to share ""galactic boosts"" and other treats with humans. It's a trick that lets the corporate titan sidestep its own massive legacy and leap into a burgeoning space in the market: While many customers in the 1980s were satisfied with a McDonald's milkshake, CosMc's now wants to cater to people seeking a colorful new category of drinks, from a Turmeric Spice Latte to a Blackberry Mint Green Tea with boba. And as a Marketplace story notes, the drink-heavy concept promises to be cheaper and simpler to operate than a traditional, full-menu McDonald's restaurant. The first CosMc's pilot location is in Bolingbrook, Ill., a suburb southwest of Chicago (where the McDonald's global headquarters is located). Ten more stores are set to follow, including openings planned in the Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio metro areas in 2024. The store near Chicago is opening at 285 N. Weber Rd. — a location formerly occupied by a Boston Market.

NPR,"This African bird will lead you to honey, if you call to it in just the right way",2023-12-07 14:00:00,Nell Greenfieldboyce,"Scientists have long puzzled over this unusual cooperative relationship between humans and a wild animal. This bird species, the Greater Honeyguide, is not domesticated at all, and no one trains them. Yet in Tanzania, Hadza foragers can use a special whistle to attract this bird, which will then flutter down and start chattering away to lead them to honey. In Mozambique, meanwhile, honey hunters with the Yao community will attract these birds with a trilling sound followed by a low grunt, which sounds like brrr-humph. In Mozambique, a honeyguide bird led Yao honey-hunter Carvalho Issa Nanguar to this bees' nest. He's using smoke and an axe to harvest the honey. Claire Spottiswoode hide caption In Mozambique, a honeyguide bird led Yao honey-hunter Carvalho Issa Nanguar to this bees' nest. He's using smoke and an axe to harvest the honey. The birds in each place are more responsive to the sounds made by the local culture, according to a new study in the journal Science. It found that birds were far more likely to appear and lead a person to honey when they heard recordings of the kind of call made by their usual human partners, compared to the sounds made by honey hunters from a different country. ""This is a very strong result which supports the idea that there's a learning process involved,"" says Brian Wood, an anthropologist at UCLA who did this new work in collaboration with Claire Spottiswoode of the University of Cambridge and the University of Cape Town. Human honey foragers learn how to communicate with these birds from their elders, according to the researchers, and those foragers say they stick to their communities' traditional calls because it's the way to get the most honey. But how do the birds learn? It's still unclear. What is clear is that this human-animal communication seems to benefit both parties, and it may go back many thousands of years. It's a rare example of humans and wild animals collaborating, with another example being dolphins and people fishing together in Brazil. In Africa, the honeyguide birds have far more information about what the bees are doing than humans ever could. The birds act as the eyes in the sky, keeping track of trees that have honey hives hidden within. Then, when a forager calls to them, a honeyguide will fly down and, twittering loudly, lead the way. ""The bird is very conspicuous. You know, it'll fly to the Hadza with its chattering sound,"" says Wood, adding that the bird basically seems to be saying, ""Hey, I'm here and I know where there's some honey, so follow me."" Once the bird arrives at a tree with honey inside, it will perch near the beehive and go silent. ""That's the signal to the Hadza to really start looking,"" says Wood. Pretty soon, the foragers will locate the hive and hack open the tree trunk. When the honeycomb is out, the birds get some of the discarded beeswax, which they love to eat. And the human foragers get the honey — which is an enormously important food for the Hadza. Wood has calculated that the Hadza get about 10% of the calories in their annual diet with the help of honeyguides. ""And so we have this nice partnership where birds are sharing their knowledge of the location of these bee trees, and honey hunters are sharing their exceptional skill and bravery and talents to be able to access the honey inside,"" says Wood. ""The bird really does provide important assistance to them."" He says a report on the human-honeyguide relationship that was published decades ago described how the Boran people of Kenya used hollowed out shells to make shrill whistles that attracted the birds. But he and Spottiswoode independently realized that the communities they worked with in Tanzania and Mozambique used different kinds of signals. ""Both of us thought it would be great to collaborate on a project where we investigate whether honey guides in our respective field sites had learned to identify and differentially respond to those culturally varying signals,"" he says. ""It was incredibly fun to do this research."" He and Spottiswoode used recording equipment to collect examples of the signals that honey hunters use. The next year, they returned to each of their research sites with a standard set of recordings: the whistles from Tanzania, the trills from Mozambique and also recordings of people just saying their names, as a control sound that would simply alert birds to the presence of a person. At each location, they did an experiment that involved a honey hunter just walking through the landscape. A researcher followed close behind, holding a speaker that was calibrated to broadcast the audio samples at a specific volume (measured in decibels). Any time a honeyguide bird appeared, the researcher would take note of it. What they found is that the birds were more likely to show up when the familiar signal used by the locals was being broadcast. In Tanzania, honeyguides appeared 82% of the time that Hadza whistles were being played. But the birds appeared only 24% of the time when the researchers played the kinds of trills traditionally used in Mozambique. The opposite was true for birds living in Mozambique. They responded to trills 73% of the time, but only 26% of the time when whistles from Tanzania were broadcast. This makes it clear that the birds had to have learned what their human neighbors do when they want to partner up and go honey-hunting. The fact that these birds can respond to culturally-specific cues is fascinating, says Steve Nowicki, a bird communication researcher at Duke University who co-wrote a commentary that accompanied the researchers' report on their findings. He points out that these birds come from a group of birds that isn't known for vocal learning, unlike parrots or songbirds. ""That's why I think it's kind of remarkable that the honeyguides are cueing in on these population-specific cultural differences,"" says Nowicki. The birds couldn't have learned how to do this from their parents, because honeyguides lay their eggs in the nests of other species which then raise the offspring. But Wood notes that when foragers hack open a tree and expose honeycomb, typically more than one honeyguide flies in to enjoy the treat.

Claire Spottiswoode hide caption Honey-hunters in Niassa Special Reserve, Mozambique leave out tasty wax for the honeyguide birds that led them to beehives. ""There's often several honeyguides, up to half-a-dozen or even more,"" says Wood. That means it's possible that younger birds watch how the older ones interact with people and then start to copy that behavior. If that's the case, then honeyguide birds would learn about these special calls from their elders, just like their human partners do.",6830,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/12/07/1217800692/african-honeyguide-bird-calls-honey-human-cultural-evolution,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/12/07/spottiswoode-adh4129-image-6-1-_custom-c541f3a8f6b647e47e87699d4171d7641a47c02d-s1100-c50.jpg,Politics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country hunter heard raise behavior respond bravery fly sample brian share record back return flutter sound honeycomb enormously hey incredibly unusual independently partnership silent kind relationship rare track hidden commentary enjoy long close finding trill dolphin annual described culture reserve nowicki harvest project strong chatter compare traditionally exceptional africa leave neighbor lay bird open responsive beeswax calibrate start hollow alert traditional study decade landscape learn fun honeyguide cue issa honey nest cultural pretty presence train realize hadza partner local accord information benefit basically sky equipment carvalho eat scientist tanzania living measure whistle anthropologist trunk arrives set guide university fascinate twitter idea specie cape young site perch simply hive ago locate experiment speaker attract niassa opposite field year publish tasty duke away cambridge forager follow act result report found tree typically clear calorie collaboration ucla difference usual communicate conspicuous inside audio spottiswoode wood person unlike discard case hide differentially accompany collaborate shell kenya town expose party make special possible wax axe nanguar domesticate eye caption nice talent boran access egg broadcast recording skill vary work calculate songbird support diet grunt science add interact different claire yao group walk research signal journal love lead fact place low honeyguides knowledge identify control food remarkable animal beehive fishing parent note vocal elder collect researcher process shrill decibel wild specific important puzzle stick offspring point played copy cooperative smoke culturally involve hold time respective familiar volume loudly hack mozambique brazil provide standard show unclear watch steve thousand treat location parrot bee human communication great community call investigate assistance,0.99745,0.13177159590043921,8.666217457886674,0.5035154721821389,0
NPR,Reuters releases investigation finding Israeli tank fire killed 1 of its journalists,2023-12-07 13:58:00,Jane Arraf,"The camera that belonged to Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah, who was killed by what a Reuters investigation has found was an Israeli tank crew, is displayed during a press conference by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in Beirut, Lebanon, on Thursday. BEIRUT, Lebanon — Investigations conducted by two news organizations and two human rights groups have concluded an Israeli tank round killed a Reuters video journalist near the Lebanese border in October and that Israeli forces either knew or should have known they were targeting journalists. The reports are the first public investigative findings of any killing of a journalist in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas — a conflict that has been one of the deadliest for media in recent history. The Committee to Protect Journalists has confirmed the death of at least 63 journalists and media workers since the Gaza war began. They include 56 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese journalists. The Israeli military said after the attack that it was investigating the incident. It has not yet issued any findings. Israeli military officials have said repeatedly that they do not target journalists. Lebanese video journalist Issam Abdallah, 37, was killed and a photographer for Agence France-Presse, Christina Assi, 28, was severely wounded in the Oct. 13 attack. At least five others were also wounded. The news teams were covering clashes along the border where Israel and the militia Hezbollah were trading fire. All were wearing protective vests and helmets — most clearly marked ""PRESS"" — during more than an hour in which they reported from the same location, according to the Reuters investigation. ""The Israeli military knew or should have known that they were civilians yet attacked them anyway in two separate strikes 37 seconds apart,"" Amnesty International said in a report released Thursday. A separate report released by Human Rights Watch echoed the findings by Amnesty, Reuters and AFP. Reuters said an Israeli helicopter had hovered overhead before the first strike. At least one of the press vehicles had tape spelling out ""TV"" on the roof. The reports released Thursday found no evidence of military targets near the journalists. Reuters said evidence of Israeli tank round shrapnel was found embedded in a vehicle and in body armor. Abdallah was killed instantly while Assi, who can be heard in a video screaming as a camera continued to roll after the attack, had her leg severed and is still in hospital. Reuters said it spoke to more than 30 government and security officials, forensics and weapons experts and others for its investigation. Reuters said the journalists were over half a mile from the border with Israel when they were attacked. Its report included a timeline including an image of live video of smoke rising from behind a hill being filmed by Abdallah. After 45 minutes of filming the camera focused on an Israeli outpost and tank firing into Lebanon. Less than 90 seconds later the first of two tank rounds fired from another hill hit the team, killing Abdullah. A second round 37 seconds later set a car used by Al Jazeera on fire. Two journalists from the Lebanese network Al Mayadeen were killed in another attack in Lebanon on Nov. 21 as they filmed near the border. Human rights officials said the multiple sources of video and other images from the attack on Abdallah and the other journalists made it possible to carry out unusually detailed analysis. That is not the case with most of the other attacks, either in Lebanon or in Gaza.",3564,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217855847/reuters-journalist-death-issam-abdallah-israel,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,International News,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,tv heard belong wound investigation ongoing hill minute case protective photographer kill public fire cover attack force weapon make scream expert armor half possible vehicle analysis continued hamas deadliest finding severely network body recent detailed roof instantly hour vest journalist israel tape hover wear leg christina roll death group investigative overhead shrapnel release multiple agence incident amnesty crew beirut spell conference conclude medium image abdallah film repeatedly mayadeen civilian begin strike car carry militia evidence accord focus afp abdullah protect include marked embed live outpost hospital forensics military worker video history unusually gaza issam tank october government clash smoke set spoke conduct thursday displayed reuters echoed issue camera international hit round helmet lebanese israeli news target border confirm trading press watch knew lebanon location hezbollah timeline mile palestinian assi conflict helicopter jazeera source human investigate separate rise report security found sever organization official committee team,-0.9803999999999999,0.6734006734006733,10.171197511664072,0.28833333333333333,0
NPR,White House proposes to 'march in' on patents for costly drugs,2023-12-07 13:54:00,Sydney Lupkin,"The Biden administration is taking another crack at high prescription drug prices. This time its sights are set on drugs that rely on taxpayer-funded inventions. The federal government spends billions of dollars a year on biomedical research that can – and often does – lead to prescription drugs. For years, activists have pushed the government to use so-called march-in rights when a taxpayer-funded invention isn't publicly available on reasonable terms. They say the law allows the government to march in and license certain patents of high-priced drugs to other companies to sell them at lower prices. But it's never happened before. All requests for the government to march in when the price for a drug was too high have been declined, including for prostate cancer drug Xtandi earlier this year. Now, the Biden administration is proposing a framework to guide government agencies on how to use march-in authorities if a drug's price is considered too high. ""When drug companies won't sell taxpayer funded drugs at reasonable prices, we will be prepared to allow other companies to provide those drugs for less,"" White House National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard said during a press call ahead of Thursday morning's announcement. ""If American taxpayers paid to help invent a prescription drug, the drug companies should sell it to the American public for a reasonable price."" The move follows a monthslong effort by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Commerce to review the government's march-in authorities under the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. Next, there will be a 60-day public comment period for the proposal. Opponents say march-in rights were never meant for tackling high prices. They say the Bayh-Dole Act is critical for public-private partnerships to develop government-funded research into products that can be made available to the masses, and that reinterpreting the law could have dangerous consequences for innovation. ""This would be yet another loss for American patients who rely on public-private sector collaboration to advance new treatments and cures,"" Megan Van Etten, spokesperson for the trade group PhRMA, wrote in an emailed statement. ""The Administration is sending us back to a time when government research sat on a shelf, not benefitting anyone."" Ameet Sarpatwari, assistant director of the Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law at Harvard Medical School, said that while ""march-in"" sounds militant and like the government is stealing something, it's not the case at all. ""There is nothing that is being stolen. There is nothing that is being seized,"" he said. ""This is the government exercising its rights on a voluntary agreement that a private company [or university] has entered into with the federal government by accepting funding for research."" The proposed framework clarifies that this existing authority can be used if a government-funded drug's price is too high, something the National Institutes of Health has declined to exercise for many years. With the new proposal, it's no longer a dormant government power, Sarpatwari said. The Biden administration has not announced any drugs whose patents it intends to march in on. Still, knowing the government is willing to use this power may change companies' behavior when they're considering price hikes. For James Love, who directs Knowledge Ecology International, a public interest group, the framework could take a stronger stance against high drug prices. ""It is better than I had expected in some ways, but if the bar for dealing with high prices is: 'extreme, unjustified, and exploitative of a health or safety need,' that is going to lead to some unnecessary arguments about what is 'extreme' or 'exploitative,' "" he said, referring to language in the framework. He noted the framework also doesn't say anything about marching in if a drug's price in the U.S. is much higher than elsewhere around the world. March-in is also limited, Harvard's Sarpatwari said. Since the intellectual property around drugs is complicated and typically relies on multiple patents, it's possible that even marching in on one or two government-funded patents wouldn't be enough to allow another company to make a cheaper competing product. ""Can a third party dance around the other intellectual property protecting the product? Possibly,"" Sarpatwari said. ""[March-in] only reaches only so far.""",4413,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/12/07/1217882958/white-house-proposes-to-march-in-on-patents-for-costly-drugs,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,Politics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,funding harvard behavior available steal enter taxpayer refer send treatment change back militant shelf argument sound public intend request mass patient partnership critical spends american develop invention ahead opponent service economic agency prostate power megan strong happen effort company cancer email assistant patent law deal rely review property write meant reinterpret therapeutic prescription multiple benefitting push school reach stance department biden consider move biomedical framework directs cheaper sarpatwari price commerce ameet tackle voluntary advance private set james guide university possibly exercise international bar limited sight invent national period exist press safety year loss dormant exploitative sat follow act spokesperson typically collaboration innovation interest prepared etten dollar unjustified program case dangerous morning lael party make possible sell administration dance expect paid medical brainard seize announcement license ecology compete comment publicly group complicate research regulation term monthslong advisor lead love cure proposal consequence trade hike crack low knowledge decline high sector note earlier federal protect include director fund unnecessary government phrma world longer health announce xtandi time thursday statement house authority intellectual provide agreement reasonable clarifies propose accept language march white human billion product institute call relies activist,0.9570000000000001,0.20394289598912302,10.359502487562189,0.4470007215007214,0
NPR,Medicare open enrollment ends today. Ignoring the deadline could cost you,2023-12-07 13:40:00,Susan Jaffe,"A counselor, right, navigates a client through the Medicare signup process at the Aging and Disability Resource Center of Broward County in Sunrise, Florida. Medicare open enrollment season ends Dec. 7. Angela M. Du Bois, a retired software tester in Durham, North Carolina, wasn't looking to replace her UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plan. She wasn't concerned as the Dec. 7 deadline approached for choosing another of the privately run health insurance alternatives to original Medicare. But then something caught her attention: When she went to her doctor last month, she learned that the doctor and the hospital where she works will not accept her insurance next year. Faced with either finding a new doctor or finding a new plan, Du Bois said the decision was easy. ""I'm sticking with her because she knows everything about me,"" she said of her doctor, whom she's been seeing for more than a decade. The period when most seniors can change Medicare health plans and prescription drug coverage ends Thursday. Du Bois isn't the only one tuning out when commercials about the open enrollment deadline flood the airwaves each year — even though there could be good reasons to shop around. But sifting through the offerings has become such an ordeal that few people want to repeat it. Avoidance is so rampant that only 10% of beneficiaries switched Medicare Advantage plans in 2019. Once open enrollment ends, there are limited options for a do-over. People in Medicare Advantage plans can make one change from January through March to go to another Advantage plan or back to the original, government-run Medicare. And the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has expanded the criteria for granting a ""special enrollment period"" to make changes in drug or Advantage plans anytime, including a recently added opportunity to switch if an individual chose a plan based on misleading or inaccurate plan details. But most seniors will generally allow their existing policy to renew automatically, like it or not. Keeping her doctor was not Du Bois' only reason for switching plans, though. With help from Senior PharmAssist, a Durham nonprofit that advises seniors about Medicare, she found a Humana Medicare Advantage plan that would not only be accepted by her providers but also cover her medications — saving her more than $14,000 a year, said Gina Upchurch, the group's executive director. Senior PharmAssist is one of the federally funded State Health Insurance Assistance Programs, known as SHIPs, available across the country to provide unbiased assistance during the open enrollment season and year-round to help beneficiaries appeal coverage denials and iron out other problems. ""Many people are simply overwhelmed by the calls, ads, the sheer number of choices, and this 'choice overload' contributes to decision-making paralysis,"" said Upchurch. Seniors in Durham have as many as 74 Advantage plans and 20 drug-only plans to choose from, she said. Upchurch said the big insurance companies like the way the system works now, with few customers inclined to explore other plans. ""They call it 'stickiness,'"" she said. ""If we had fewer and clear choices — an apple, orange, grape, or banana — most people would review options."" In Washington state, one woman switched from a plan she had had for more than a decade to one that will cover all her drugs — and next year she will save an estimated $7,240, according to Tim Smolen, director of the state's SHIP, Statewide Health Insurance Benefits Advisors. In Northern California, another woman changed drug plans for the first time since 2012, and her current premium of $86 will plummet to 40 cents a month next year, an annual savings of about $1,000, said Pam Smith, a local director for California's SHIP, called the Health Insurance Counseling & Advocacy Program. And in Ohio, a woman sought help after learning that her monthly copayment for the blood thinner Eliquis would rise from $102 to $2,173 next year. A counselor with Ohio's SHIP found another plan that will cover all her medications for the year and cost her just $1,760. If she stuck with her current plan, she would be paying an additional $24,852 for all her drugs next year, said Chris Reeg, who directs that state's program. In some cases, CMS tries to persuade beneficiaries to switch. Since 2012, it has sent letters every year to thousands of beneficiaries in poorly performing Advantage and drug plans, encouraging them to consider other options. These are plans that have received less than three out of five stars for three years from CMS. ""You may want to compare your plan to other plans available in your area and decide if it's still right for you,"" the letter says. CMS typically allows low-scoring plans to continue to operate. In an unusual move, officials recently found that one plan had such a terrible track record that they will terminate its contract with government health programs next December. CMS also contacts people about changing plans during open enrollment if they get a subsidy — called ""extra help"" — that pays for their drug plan's monthly premium and some out-of-pocket expenses. Because some premiums will be more expensive next year, CMS is warning beneficiaries that they could be in for a surprise: a monthly bill to cover cost increases the subsidy doesn't cover. But many beneficiaries receive no such nudge from the government to find out if there is a better, less expensive plan that meets their needs and includes their health care providers or drugs. That leaves many people with Medicare drug or Advantage plans on their own to decipher any changes to their plans while there is still time to enroll in another. Insurers are required to alert members with an ""annual notice of change,"" a booklet often more than two dozen pages long. Unless they plow through it, they may discover in January that their premiums have increased, the provider network has changed, or some drugs are no longer covered. If a drug plan isn't offered the next year and the beneficiary doesn't pick a new one, the insurer will select a plan of its choosing, without considering costs or needed drug coverage. ""Every year, our call volume skyrockets in January when folks get invoices for that new premium,"" said Reeg, the Ohio program director. At that point, Medicare Advantage members have until March 30 to switch to another plan or enroll in government-run Medicare. There's no similar grace period for people with stand-alone drug plans. ""They are locked into that plan for the calendar year."" One cost-saving option is the government's Medicare Savings Program, which helps low-income beneficiaries pay their monthly premium for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services. The Biden administration's changes in eligibility for subsidies announced in September will extend financial assistance to an estimated 860,000 people — if they apply. In the past, only about half of those eligible applied. Fixing a mistake after the open enrollment period ends Dec. 7 is easy for some people. Individuals who receive ""extra help"" to pay for drug plan premiums and those who have a subsidy to pay for Medicare's Part B can change drug plans every three months. At any time, beneficiaries can switch to a Medicare Advantage plan that earns the top five-star rating from CMS, if one is available. ""We've been able to use those five-star plans as a safety net,"" said Reeg, the Ohio SHIP director. Other beneficiaries may be able to get a ""special enrollment period"" to switch plans after the open enrollment ends if they meet certain conditions. Local SHIP offices can help people make any of these changes when possible. Reeg spends a lot of time trying to ensure that unwelcome surprises — like a drug that isn't covered — don't happen in the first place. ""What we want to do is proactively educate Medicare patients so they know that they can go to the doctors and hospitals they want to go to in the upcoming year,"" she said.

NPR,Peru braces for protests after former President Fujimori's release from prison,2023-12-07 13:26:00,Simeon Tegel,"LIMA, Peru â€” Peru was readying itself on Thursday for three days of protests against the abrupt freeing of former strongman leader Alberto Fujimori from prison, where he had been serving a 25-year sentence for orchestrating the massacre of 25 suspected subversives during his 1990-2000 presidency. Fujimori, 85, walked free from the Lima jail on Wednesday evening after a controversial decision by the constitutional court to reinstate a 2017 pardon on humanitarian grounds for the former autocrat. Looking frail but happy, Fujimori was using supplemental oxygen and wearing a surgical mask as he was embraced by his son Kenji, a former congressman, and daughter Keiko, a three-time presidential runner-up, in front of cheering crowds, before getting into an SUV. His liberation, after serving approximately 16 years of his sentence, came despite warnings from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that Fujimori had not completed the requirements for such a pardon for a conviction for crimes against humanity. The conditions would include acknowledging guilt, undergoing independent medical tests and paying millions of dollars in compensation. The ruling risks making Peru an international pariah and also undermines access to justice, including through the Inter-American system, which Peruvians frequently rely on given the failings of Peru's creaking and often corrupt legal system, warns Sonia Paredes, of Amnesty International Peru. ""This sentence is not about vengeance or retribution but about justice. What we are losing sight of here is the victims of human rights abuses,"" she says. ""They should be first and foremost when pardons are considered and that has not happened here."" The pardon was initially authorized six years ago by then-President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski as he sought to mollify a congress dominated by the Fujimorista party, Popular Force. But it was quickly overturned by the inter-American court and the political backlash within Peru was so strong that it led to Kuczynski's resignation under threat of impeachment. But its reapproval now, in controversial circumstances, has caused widespread consternation in Peru. Cardinal Pedro Barreto, the country's highest-ranking archbishop, described the pardon as a ""slap in the face that hurts our soul."" He added: ""It's important to transmit calm while also expressing our indignation."" Fujimori remains a hero for many Peruvians on the right. His government oversaw the crushing of the Shining Path, a rebel group that's Latin America's only significant Maoist movement, whose bloodletting claimed roughly 30,000 lives, mainly of poor Peruvians living in remote Andean villages.

But billions of dollars vanished from public coffers on his watch and, in 1992, he trashed the constitution by abruptly shuttering congress and the courts. He also faces several future trials and it is unclear how the pardon will affect them. One of those trials, for a massacre by a clandestine death squad in the coastal town of Pativilca, is due to start later this month. Another is the case of forced sterilizations, in which thousands of mainly poor and Indigenous women were allegedly bullied and tricked into being sterilized against their wishes. Peruvian prosecutors have applied to the courts in Chile, from where Fujimori was extradited in 2007, for permission to try him for that case. His pardon comes as the deeply unpopular conservative-dominated congress, with just 6% approval, has been accused of dismantling Peru's fragile democracy, including packing various institutions, such as the constitutional court, with unqualified candidates during rushed, opaque processes. Two members of the constitutional court, who opposed the pardon, have said they were not notified of the ruling to free Fujimori. The court's chairman, Francisco Morales, claims that that would have been unnecessary as, given their stances on the matter, they would not have helped draft it. It is also the latest human rights controversy to rock Peru as authorities slow-march investigations into security forces' killings of dozens of anti-government protesters in December 2022 and January 2023.

NPR,"How the Republican presidential candidates view Jan. 6, democracy and voting issues",2023-12-07 11:31:00,Miles Parks,", Hansi Lo Wang , Benjamin Swasey Pro-Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Samuel Corum/Getty Images hide caption Pro-Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Twenty years ago, about 80% of Republicans trusted U.S. elections. Things have gone downhill since then, driven by presidential defeats in 2008 and 2012, and former President Donald Trump's false insistence that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Now, that trust number is reversed. Just 22% of Republican voters have high confidence that votes in 2024 will be counted accurately, according to a June poll by the Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Center. That means it's extremely difficult (though not impossible) to be a viable GOP candidate in a statewide or national primary race without at least nodding to the possibility of election shenanigans. And candidates in the Republican presidential primary have generally gotten the memo, though each has found a different way to tap into those election anxieties. Here's where the current notable presidential hopefuls, including Trump, stand on issues of democracy and election integrity. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event Saturday in Ankeny, Iowa. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption Trump, who sought to overturn an election loss and has said he'd punish his political foes if returned to power, is an antidemocratic force in U.S. politics. Dating back more than a decade, Trump worked to undermine trust in America's election systems (a tactic of authoritarian regimes). 2020 supercharged his voting falsehoods. States turned to more mail voting in response to the COVID pandemic, and Trump used the powers of the presidency to try to restrict access to that voting method. He then seized on those changes to falsely claim the system was rigged against him when he lost, and he set into motion a plan to try to stay in power against the will of the voters, leading to multiple criminal indictments. He asked state officials to ""find"" votes and to stop counting rightfully cast ballots in order to help him. Importantly, Trump's election claims were not only bogus, but federal prosecutors allege he almost certainly knew they were untrue and continued to spread them even as some fellow Republicans worried about the unrest and violence that could follow. In the time after voting ended, Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney General William Barr investigated the many voter fraud claims the president was pushing and concluded there was nothing to them. On the day electoral votes were set to be counted in the U.S. Capitol, a violent mob of Trump's supporters overtook the building, leading to a woman being shot by police, and more than 100 police officers injured. ""We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,"" Trump told the crowd gathered at the Ellipse, before they marched down Pennsylvania Avenue. Trump has defended his actions that day, and pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. But in the time since, Trump has only doubled down on his false and antidemocratic rhetoric. Late last year, he posted online that ""massive fraud"" like what he claims happened in 2020 should allow ""the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution."" — Miles Parks Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a campaign rally Saturday in Newton, Iowa. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption For long after the 2020 election, DeSantis dodged questions about Trump's false election fraud claims and was hesitant to recognize Joe Biden's win. That is, until a few months ago, when he said ""of course"" Trump lost. In the years DeSantis didn't weigh in on the 2020 election, though, he often supported candidates who denied the results of the election. As Florida governor, DeSantis has signed a slew of restrictive voting bills that he says protect election integrity but that voting rights advocates say disenfranchised thousands of voters — and most affected Black Floridians. In 2018, Florida voters approved a ballot measure restoring voting rights to most Floridians with a prior felony conviction. But before the measure went into effect, DeSantis signed legislation requiring these individuals to fulfill every part of their sentence, including paying any fees or fines, before getting their voting rights back. However, the state has yet to create any sort of database of how much these individuals owe. As a result, advocates say thousands of Floridians have not had any clarity on how or when they can get their rights back. Last year, DeSantis pushed for a new state agency that specifically investigates election crimes. The office's first arrests were very controversial. In a big press event, DeSantis announced the state arrested roughly 20 people who voted in 2020 who were not eligible to regain their voting rights after a felony conviction. Many of these individuals say they believed they were able to vote because election officials gave them voter registration cards, and attorneys representing some of them have accused the state of entrapping their clients. Both in 2021 and this year, DeSantis has signed legislation creating more mail voting restrictions. This year's law also placed new rules on third-party voter registration groups, which historically have been a key way people of color in Florida have registered. — Ashley Lopez Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks during a campaign event on Oct. 21 in Pella, Iowa. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption The former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor has been publicly critical of Trump's actions after losing the 2020 election. ""Many of his actions since the election were wrong and will be judged harshly by history,"" Haley wrote in a 2021 Wall Street Journal op-ed. NBC News reported that a voter at an Iowa event in May asked Haley how she would make sure there's a ""fair and speedy"" trial for those charged in the Jan. 6 attack. According to NBC, Haley replied, ""I don't know enough about each individual [rioter] but that's my rule: If you break the law, you pay the price."" Still, Haley has emphasized that she is ""proud of the successes of the Trump administration."" And while she has acknowledged Biden's victory in 2020, Haley has also supported the campaigns of Republicans who have cast doubt on the election results, including Adam Laxalt, the former Nevada state attorney general who lost a Senate race; and Don Bolduc, the retired U.S. Army general who lost a Senate race in New Hampshire. Haley's campaign website describes her as a ""vocal advocate for voter ID,"" and she often highlights the risk of voter fraud in elections, despite proven voter fraud being exceedingly rare. ""In the America I see, everyone has full confidence in our elections. Voter ID will be the law of the land just like we did in South Carolina,"" Haley said at her campaign kickoff speech in February. — Hansi Lo Wang Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy speaks with reporters outside a polling station after casting a ballot on statewide elections Nov. 7 in Columbus, Ohio. Andrew Spear/Getty Images hide caption Prior to his presidential run, Ramaswamy criticized Trump's actions after his 2020 election defeat. In his 2022 book, Nation of Victims, Ramaswamy called Jan. 6 ""a dark day for democracy"" and labeled Trump a ""sore loser"" who pushed ""weak"" claims of election fraud. Republicans, he wrote, had ""placed grudges about elections at the core of party identity."" More recently, however, candidate Ramaswamy has leaned into those sorts of grudges. During Wednesday night's primary debate, he repeated several conspiracy theories, including that Jan. 6 appears to be ""an inside job"" and that the 2020 election was ""stolen"" from Trump by Big Tech platforms that he has alleged interfered through their censorship. Ramaswamy has proposed far-reaching, if implausible, reforms to voting policies. When asked on NBC's Meet the Press how he would've handled Vice President Mike Pence's role on Jan. 6, Ramaswamy said he would've used the ""historic opportunity"" to pass sweeping measures such as ""single-day voting on Election Day,"" thereby eliminating early and mail voting options, and federal voter identification rules. ""In my capacity as president of the Senate, I would have led through that level of reform, then on that condition certified the election results, served it up to the president — President Trump — then to sign that into law,"" he said. Conditioning the transfer of power on the passage of radical and restrictive voter reforms would likely not have found many fans among Democrats in Congress. Ramaswamy's most unique proposal is what he calls ""civic duty voting."" It's a constitutional amendment that would increase the U.S. voting age from 18 to 25, apart from those who serve at least six months in the military or as a first responder, or pass a civics test. While critics note it would disenfranchise tens of millions of U.S. citizens, Ramaswamy defends his plan in part by quoting the ""IKEA effect,"" in which ""psychologists have found people put greater value in things that they have to work for or invest in."" — Benjamin Swasey Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie speaks during the New Hampshire Republican Party's First in the Nation Leadership Summit in Nashua on Oct. 13. Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Christie, a former Trump ally, has in recent years explicitly and repeatedly condemned the former president for his false claims about the 2020 election. ""You can't undercut our democracy with no facts,"" Christie told CNN in 2021, explaining his break with Trump. Christie has said Trump's attempts to overturn his election defeat should disqualify him from holding the Oval Office again, and Christie, a former federal prosecutor, told the NPR Politics Podcast in September that the special counsel's federal election subversion case against Trump is an ""absolutely appropriate [case] to have been brought."" Christie was a two-term governor of New Jersey in the 2010s, and during his tenure vetoed a few Democratic-backed voting bills. One was a 2016 automatic voter registration measure, and during a news conference, Christie reportedly referred to the proposal as a ""cocktail of fraud."" In 2018, now-Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation to establish automatic voter registration, and there's been no proven widespread voter fraud associated with the state's system since then. — Benjamin Swasey",10506,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217716577/republican-presidential-candidates-january-6-elections-democracy,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/11/17/lowang-hansi_02_sq-e32341a32990b714661f4b90643d92881e955c15.jpg?s=100&c=85&f=jpeg,Politics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country cocktail historic owe increase response condition change disqualify opinion hesitant quote nbc retire doubt sought critical book trial charge describes core lose highlight censorship sort power samuel andrew happen overtook covid electoral restrict system politics color difficult npr wrong law put day rightfully storm told transfer course key lean cnn viable multiple critic america subversion poll clarity conclude downhill saturday bill falsely floridian conspiracy emphasize repeatedly biden station twenty bogus supercharge military late nation history crowd ron violence reportedly affected measure stand set iowa termination action proud automatic advocate oval podcast wall turn require website accuse former knew wang claim supporter phil civic loss acknowledge controversial rhetoric condemn tech weigh result explicitly found amendment fraud inside victim despite civics tactic vetoed meet ashley defends hide guilty attack label special ally presidency slew policy card administration early opportunity appropriate access plan online counting investigates entrepreneur regain seize proven believe work recently option support fellow william chris president article christie gop part governor group eligible presidential debate dodge pandemic research avenue building journal overturn nikki scott antidemocratic conference proposal approve trump serve citizen image barr ellipse reply democracy confidence nashua note prior pay federal include nod general memo fulfill give night constitution woman nevada announce order time hold race harshly office violent shot hansi hell reform getty donald weak insistence hopeful propose create rally thousand election indictment march ramaswamy investigate undercut ambassador gather great bolduc police leadership army steal refer exceedingly back id return win foe swasey rare stop kickoff long continued notable sentence agency murphy joseph tap tenure full rule arrest mike primary responder unique vivek handle effect laxalt represent identification allege implausible write decade level anymore trust senate psychologist polling gov push crime mail roughly passage pella cast wednesday possibility ballot defend worried dark explain reporter shenanigan deny conditioning accord event platform mob establish false price role political historically widespread current reverse hampshire legislation sore injured break adam million authoritarian sign certify republican congress carolina spread candidate defeat test ago center national fight register press absolutely fee radical year duty speaks voting conviction post client unrest follow specifically punish driven report extremely newton prosecutor official vice sweep motion september columbus speech associate double judged repeat june criminal case number florida disenfranchise untrue party force fair make stay voter loser ten victory caption restore haley jersey interfere ohio recent penny eliminate success importantly campaign grudge month land job date question summit attorney different restrictive speedy park publicly criticize benjamin find black regulation lead plead fact state value risk place street accurately high ankeny big method anxiety vocal generally lopez vote protect felony registration run recognize impossible individual february restriction entrap capitol joe issue brought invest statewide pennsylvania identity regime desantis news rig database falsehood integrity count undermine fine constitutional theory mile age south capacity ikea massive attempt counsel call rioter officer democrat,-0.9955,0.08566533409480295,9.498559837728191,0.44033150033150026,0

Chris Christie, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, Florida Gov.

Israel says it collected more than 1,500 eyewitness accounts of rape or evidence of sexual violence from Hamas attacks. Hamas denies its fighters were involved in sexual violence.

Senate Republicans voted yesterday to prevent debate on a security funding bill that would include money for Ukraine and Israel. President Biden warned Congress that it needed to approve funding for Ukraine before the holiday break, or it would strengthen Russian President Vladimir Putin's position. Republican lawmakers want to see U.S. border security and immigration policy measures added to the package.

NPR,"Sen. Bernie Sanders says aid to Israel should be conditional, citing the toll on Gaza",2023-12-07 10:44:00,Rachel Treisman,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, pictured at a committee hearing last month, joined Republican senators in blocking aid to Israel and Ukraine. He tells NPR why he thinks support for Israel's military should have strings attached. The Senate voted 49 to 51 on Wednesday not to advance a bill that would provide billions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel, aid the White House says is essential for safeguarding democracy across the globe. Republicans made good on their threat to block consideration of the bill unless it included their preferred border security and immigration measures. They were joined by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats — and one of Congress' most prominent progressives. Sanders voted no for a different reason, as he later explained in a statement: ""I do not believe that we should give the right-wing extremist Netanyahu government an additional $10.1 billion dollars with no strings attached to continue their inhumane war against the Palestinian people."" In floor remarks and a letter to Democrats earlier this week, Sanders said he agreed with many of the bill's provisions, including its support for humanitarian aid and Ukraine's right to defend itself. But he criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, noting that it has killed some 16,000 Palestinians and displaced another 1.8 million from their homes in Gaza. He also pointed to Israeli settler violence and a growing Palestinian death toll in the West Bank. ""[Israel has] the right to go to war against Hamas, who committed an atrocious invasion of their country,"" Sanders told NPR's Morning Edition before Wednesday's vote. ""But they do not have the right to go to war against the Palestinian people."" Sanders told Morning Edition's Michel Martin that he believes the only way the U.S. can tell Netanyahu that ""his military tactics are unacceptable"" is to not give him a blank check for the $10 billion that President Biden's security package seeks. He does support giving Israel $4 billion to replenish its Iron Dome, a decade-old network of radar detectors and missile launchers that intercepts incoming rockets. But he said further U.S. aid to Israel should come with conditions, adding that ""we cannot allow Israeli settlers to kill Palestinians on the West Bank"" and ""have got to also make it clear that the people of Gaza have a right to return and rebuild their homes."" ""And maybe most importantly, we need a commitment from the Netanyahu government that there will be a two-state solution, that the Palestinians in the area have a right to their own homeland, to live with security and dignity,"" Sanders said. Unlike some of his fellow progressives, Sanders has not called for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. He told NPR that would be unrealistic, given Hamas' stated goal of destroying Israel. He says the changes needed in the region — now in its fifth war in 15 years — can only happen under new leadership in Gaza. While Israel aims to remove Hamas from power, it remains unclear who would step in to govern the territory. ""You need new Palestinian leadership which pays attention to the needs of the Palestinian people and understands that Israel has a right to exist in a two-state situation,"" Sanders said. ""Not Hamas."" The question of financial support for the militaries of Ukraine and Israel has both dominated and divided Capitol Hill in recent months. In October, Biden asked Congress for nearly $106 billion in funding for Israel, Ukraine, countering China and border security. The package included some $14 billion for Israel and more than $61 billion for Ukraine, which the Biden administration has repeatedly warned is running out of money to defend itself from Russia. House Republicans are increasingly opposed to sending more aid to Ukraine, though they did approve a $14.5 billion military aid package for Israel (funded by cuts to the IRS) last month. The Democratic-controlled Senate said it would reject it, since it didn't include money for Ukraine, humanitarian aid in Gaza and other Biden administration priorities. Some Democrats have also raised questions about aid to Israel. A majority of Senate Democrats — as well as Sanders and independent Maine Sen. Angus King — wrote Biden a letter last month asking him to defend his request for aid and ensure that Israel will use U.S. military assistance in keeping with international law. After Wednesday's failed vote, Biden accused Republicans of ""playing chicken"" with the package by demanding ""partisan"" border policies, but also indicated he would be open to making compromises in order to get the bill passed. A bipartisan negotiating group working border policy in the Senate has been unable to overcome disagreements around asylum policy and other border security issues. Republicans have warned that they will not agree to a broader security bill without resolving the border issue. The president said Congress must approve funding for Ukraine before it goes on holiday recess late next week, or else it will be giving Russian president Vladimir Putin a gift. Sanders agrees, adding that he expected that Congress would need to go back to the drawing board and hopes it can ""do the best that we can ... as soon as we can."" ""I do think that it's absolutely imperative, that we need a spending bill right now, which makes it clear to Putin that the United States and the rest of the democratic world are supportive of Ukraine and other democracies,"" Sanders said. ""And I think humanitarian aid for Gaza and other parts of the world are desperately needed."" Sanders also weighed in on a recent incident in his home state, in which a man shot three college students of Palestinian descent as they walked down the street in Burlington, speaking Arabic and wearing keffiyehs. All three survived, though one could face permanent paralysis in his legs due to a bullet lodged in his spine. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime. Sanders said the attack took place a mile from where he lives, calling it ""beyond belief and ... unspeakable."" He described the victims as ""really bright, lovely young men"" and said he had spoken to one of them recently. And he alluded to the broader context, in which reports of antisemitic, Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian incidents have skyrocketed in the wake of Oct. 7. ""That adds to all of the stress and ugliness that we're seeing taking place today,"" he said. ""It is a tough time for our country, to say the least."" Sanders said in a democratic society, people have the right to disagree and participate in the political process. But they cannot, he said, translate their political views ""into hatred of an entire people."" ""This country has gone through hundreds of years of bigotry and hatred,"" he added. ""We're trying to climb our way out of it. Let's not recede into tribalism and hatred just because of somebody's religion.""

NPR,'Rebuild the base': How the Biden campaign will tackle a possible Trump rematch,2023-12-07 05:38:00,Tyler Bartlam,", Ari Shapiro Then presidential candidate Joe Biden waves to supporters as he finishes speaking during a drive-in campaign rally in Georgia in 2020. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption Then presidential candidate Joe Biden waves to supporters as he finishes speaking during a drive-in campaign rally in Georgia in 2020. Wednesday night in Alabama, four Republican presidential hopefuls took the stage for the last debate before next month's Iowa caucuses. Former President Donald Trump has not been to any of these debates, and he skipped this one too. Despite his absence, some poll numbers are showing that the 2024 election may be a repeat faceoff between Trump and President Biden. So where does that leave Biden's reelection campaign? And how does this impact its ultimate goal of maintaining Biden's seat in the Oval Office? Biden's principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, spoke to All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro on Wednesday to discuss the campaign's strategy for Trump and how they plan to win over voters once again. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Ari Shapiro: Biden made some remarks to donors that have made an impact. Tuesday he was in the Boston area and said, ""If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running."" Is Biden implying there that if Ron DeSantis or Nikki Haley is the nominee, a different Democrat might be better suited to run against them? Quentin Fulks: No, look, this is nothing new. And the president has said this before, when he ran for president in 2020. It was because of the threat that Donald Trump posed to our democracy and quite literally the very fabric of our country that the president promised to rebuild and restore the soul of this nation. You know, Ari, it is a little bit disheartening that we're having this [discussion] when at the same time Tuesday, Donald Trump promised that he would rule as a dictator on Day 1. So if anything, I think that the president's comments were timely, as they underscore exactly what he's talking about, and the threat that, we need to keep America moving forward and not turn it over to somebody who's promising to be a dictator. Shapiro: You're saying this is kind of an echo of a debate that the country had four years ago. Does your campaign believe that if this is a Biden-Trump matchup, there are still undecided voters to be won over? Don't most people already know how they feel about these two candidates since they were both on the ballot in 2020? Fulks: Look, our campaign doesn't take any voters for granted, and we understand that we have to do everything we need to do to communicate with voters in a very fractured media environment, to meet voters where they are, to talk to voters about what matters to them. But we are building a campaign that's well beyond and up to the task to do just that. But at the end of the day, if it's a referendum between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, we're confident that American voters are going to turn out and vote for Joe Biden. We've seen it in 2020. We saw it in 2022. We've seen it this year in 2023. Listen to All Things Considered each day here or on your local member station for more interviews like this. Shapiro: But as you think of the campaign strategy, you could be focused on motivating the base. You could be focused on access to the ballot. You could be focused on winning over undecided voters. I have a feeling you're going to say, ""We're taking a both and all-of-the-above approach."" If it's a Biden-Trump matchup, do you believe there actually are undecided voters out there in large enough numbers to make a difference? Fulks: We have to rebuild the base and continue to do exactly what we did to turn out 81 million voters to vote for the president in 2020. This is not a monolithic audience as a people. And whatever constituency you put that label on, they're not monolithic, whether it be African American voters, whether it be women, whether it be young voters. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa, on Dec. 2. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa, on Dec. 2. And so in 2020, there was a global pandemic that Donald Trump quite literally had done nothing to help, that cost the lives of a lot of Americans and, quite frankly, people around the world. Now we're in 2024. Our campaign can paint the contrast that Donald Trump would be a dictator if he was to regain power, that he would stand for the NRA, continue to brag about whipping away a woman's right to choose. But at the same time, we have an obligation to talk to American voters about what President Biden and Vice President Harris have done for them in the record of accomplishments which we feel are plentiful. Shapiro: I hear you saying this is a campaign of contrasts, but also, as you acknowledged, the 2020 election was in some sense a referendum on the way Donald Trump handled the pandemic, the economy. And voters are dissatisfied with the way that President Biden has handled the economy in the last four years, despite the economic numbers that show many people are doing well in the United States. So what is your message to people who are unimpressed with the Biden track record of the last few years? Fulks: The president is going to continue to double down and earn their support and continue to do everything he can to make life easier and more affordable for them. And that comes in stark contrast with the Republican Party and what they're putting forward, whether that's Donald Trump or not. And that's just on the economic front. They're trying to give tax breaks to the wealthy, big corporations, protecting gun rights groups, while we are focused on doing the exact opposite. And at a time where there is a lot of foreign policy stuff going on, there's economic stuff going on. We need a leader that has experience in doing that. And Joe Biden has that. And so our campaign is going to continue to double down, communicate on what the president has done, try to draw that correlation and make sure that Americans know that the president's doing it, and honestly continue to address other things that Americans are bringing to us day in and day out, with what they feel about the direction of this country, and try to address those, as he and the vice president promised they would do.",6388,https://www.npr.org/2023/12/07/1217672720/joe-biden-donald-trump-2024-election-republican-debate-alabama,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/01/06/ari_shapiro_2015_sq-b39b544922df130acf049ee31db8de947ab603e3.jpg?s=100&c=85&f=jpeg,Politics,https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.VhogjnWRzUbgzzIcAE8DswHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country honestly imply lot length alabama record frankly monolithic win fracture continue corporation seat threat promise caucus kind track discus american timely lightly large economic unimpressed power audience draw whip interview rebuild dishearten rule leave deputy address handle underscore front maintain matter put day cost edit america poll african clarity wednesday medium ultimate ballot pose global correlation biden station consider local move harris event reelection nation referendum listen experience earn ron stage stand break spoke iowa dictator million republican finish talk constituency bit oval young candidate ago turn confident former remark life bring opposite ran skip year gun speaks understand supporter nominee acknowledge ari away member motivate drew wealthy difference affordable communicate leader vice echo despite meet double absence repeat matchup hide number label tax party accomplishment make soul hear voter discussion forward policy foreign caption haley restore brag boston fulks donor direction access plan united regain believe shapiro grant support campaign quentin plentiful president tuesday choose month economy different environment comment group message easy presidential debate pandemic building base promising goal nikki scott stark state trump host wave task image dissatisfied democracy manager ankeny feel big speak focus vote protect run contrast suit impact give night world georgia woman time joe undecided office desantis show donald principal hopeful nra stuff rally faceoff election obligation exact strategy literally approach fabric area paint democrat,0.9895,0.0,7.09416342412451,0.350962000962001,0
Chicago Tribune,Hinsdale Central girls basketball staff’s abrupt resignation becomes 2nd sports controversy to hit the district,2023-12-07 20:39:00,George Wiebe,"Three Hinsdale Central High School girls basketball coaches resigned Monday resulting in a postponement of the team’s game Tuesday against Proviso West.The team’s head coach, Erin Navolio, and two assistant coaches left suddenly, without commenting on the matter.Navolio, who played for the Hinsdale Central Red Devils girls basketball team, came back to the school as an assistant coach in 2012, while also working as a first grade teacher at Saint Francis Xavier, a private school in La Grange; Navolio was promoted to head coach in 2022.Navolio could not be reached for comment Thursday.In a statement released by the school district, Hinsdale Central athletic director Mike Jezioro will assume the role as coach of the girls team until an interim or permanent replacement can be found.“We want to thank the Red Devil community for its patience as we navigate this situation, and for its continued help in supporting the growth, development and success of our student-athletes,” the school district’s statement said.The resignations are the second basketball-related controversy faced by High School District 86, coming only one week after the reinstatement of a former all-conference player for Hinsdale South’s boys basketball team.Mother of the player, Erin Savage, a resident of Darien, filed a lawsuit against the school district for alleged retaliation against her son by the former head coach of the Hinsdale South varsity basketball team, Michael Moretti.Moretti was demoted after Hinsdale South officials investigated reports of “verbal abuse, bullying (and) humiliation.”",1584,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/hinsdale/ct-hinsdale-central-girls-basketball-coach-resign-tl-1214-20231208-h2kagju3urb6tkpse3zb4k6r4i-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/EhQn61b6c7Cgq9YS34Rt6Vmjt_E=/377x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/RU5645YNZJD6BLF7KUKQCPE6WU.jpg,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,grade permanent bullying player file athletic central basketball high head back grange navigate monday verbal retaliation coach varsity xavier suddenly controversy replacement director interim resign humiliation postponement role hinsdale promote continued girl left played darien private red savage boy teacher growth patience statement proviso erin abuse mike situation success work reinstatement demote support resignation development jezioro former assume tuesday assistant resident comment allege michael south investigate devil navolio francis district result release report community week lawsuit saint game official school reach team,-0.88175,0.0,12.955474452554746,0.23941666666666667,0
Chicago Tribune,"Danny Solis, alderman who turned FBI mole, expected to hit witness stand next week in ex-Ald. Ed Burke corruption trial",2023-12-07 19:31:00,"Jason Meisner, Ray Long, Megan Crepeau","Former Ald. Daniel Solis, whose unprecedented turn as an FBI mole helped the feds take down two princes of Chicago’s Democratic political machine, is expected to be called as a defense witness next week in the corruption trial of his former colleague, ex-Ald. Edward Burke.The undercover recordings made by Solis have been the centerpiece of Burke’s ongoing trial, but Solis himself has been something of an enigma. Prosecutors opted not to call Solis as their own witness, and while Burke’s lawyers promised the judge they’d call Solis, it was not mentioned to the jury in opening statements.The picture became clearer, however, during a scheduling discussion Thursday before testimony began, when Burke attorney Chris Gair told U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall that Solis would be called as soon as Tuesday, although they may have to work around a funeral that Solis has to attend.When Kendall reminded Gair that the defense was not allowed to call Solis simply to impeach his credibility, Gair assured the judge the questioning will be broad.He said he plans to question Solis “for hours” about the recordings alone, and will also delve into Solis’ deferred prosecution deal with the U.S. attorney’s office, which will leave Solis without a criminal conviction and still collecting his $100,000 annual pension even though he will admit to corruptly accepting campaign donations from developers.“I can guarantee you, judge, anything about what deal he got and what crimes he committed, that is going to come at the end and you will be fully satisfied,” Gair said.In addition to recording Burke, the then-powerful chairman of the Finance Committee, Solis cooperated against House Speaker Michael Madigan, the head of the state Democratic Party, who was widely regarded as the most influential politician in Illinois.Madigan is scheduled to go on trial on separate racketeering charges in April.The prospect of Solis testifying in Burke’s case means the high-profile trial, which has been delayed twice by COVID-19 issues since beginning on Nov. 6, will come right down to the wire of the Christmas holiday.“You’re pushing Christmas big-time getting to (Dec. 22),” Kendall told the attorneys on Thursday. “We’re looking at a solid two days of argument, potentially a third, plus (jury) instructions.”The proposed jury instructions run more than 300 pages and will certainly take Kendall hours to read aloud to the jurors before they begin deliberations.Kendall said she likely will let thejurors know the tentative schedule on Friday, and may tell them at some point that there is no pressure to have a verdict before Christmas.“I’m not there yet, but that certainly something I’ll consider,” Kendall said. “Happy jurors are jurors who kind of know what’s going on.”Meanwhile, federal prosecutors were inching closer to wrapping up their case.Thursday morning’s testimony was focused on the FBI raid on Burke’s 14th Ward offices on Nov. 29, 2018, the same day agents descended on City Hall and put up brown butcher paper over the window’s of Burke’s third-floor office suite.Retired FBI Special Agent Pam McCarthy testified that she led a team of about 25 agents who arrived at the rear of the ward office on West 51st Street around 8:30 a.m. Three or four ward employees were there, she said. “We basically introduced ourselves, said what we were there for,” McCarthy said, adding that most of the ward employees left while the search was conducted.Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Sushma Raju, McCarthy took the jurors through a series of photos taken that day, including the interior of Burke’s office, which was furnished with a big blue leather chair behind a wood desk, shelves filled with photos, glassware and knickknacks, and a large city of Chicago flag along the wall.In a hallway leading to the office shared by Burke’s longtime aide Peter Andrews Jr. was a sign that read, “I’M NOT BOSSY, I’M JUST AGGRESSIVELY HELPFUL” Fixed to a window there was a large Cubs sticker, a noticeable oddity in Burke’s majority-White Sox territory.On Andrews’ disheveled desk were some large architectural drawings of the renovation of the Burger King at 4060 S. Pulaski Road, the same restaurant at the center of an alleged scheme by Burke and Andrews to pressure the Texas-based owners to hire Burke’s private law firm for property tax work.On top of of the Burger King plans was a printed memorandum, dated Dec. 12, 2017, from Andrews to “EMB,” an obvious reference to his boss. It laid out in seven paragraphs their history with the Burger King, including the lunch Burke had with the owners, Shoukat and Zohaib Dhanani, at the Beverly Country Club that June.“We stopped construction on the site and it is still on hold while the Department of Transportation reviews the driveway permits that were submitted mid-November,” the memo noted.The document ended by noting the Dhananis had hired a construction company from New Jersey, and that Burke had mentioned to them “since they are out of Houston, they should think about local legal representation for zoning matters and so forth.”The memo was dated the same day that Burke met with the Dhananis at the Union League Club. The father and son have both testified that Burke again pitched his law firm to them over drinks, and also urged them to attend a political fundraiser at his home that January.Also found in another area of the office was a filed folder labeled “Burger King-Tri City Foods” and a stack of information about the Dhananis, their business locations and even a 17-page Wikipedia printout of the history of Burger King.There were sticky notes with names and phone number of some of the key players in the Burger King project, as well as printed emails documenting their recent application for a driveway permit.On cross-examination, Burke attorney Joseph Duffy pointed out that nowhere in Andrews’ memo was there a reference to Burke’s law firm, Klafter & Burke, or asking the Dhananis to hire him for property tax work.In her cross-examination, Andrews’ attorney, Chelsy Van Overmeiren, put up a photo of one of the sticky notes on the screen and asked McCarthy whether she knew who wrote it. McCarthy acknowledged she did not.After McCarthy’s testimony, however, handwriting expert Kevin Kulbacki told the jury that his analysis showed both Andrews and another ward assistant, David Espinoza, had written what was on the sticky notes.Burke, 79, who served 54 years as alderman before leaving the City Council in May, is charged with 14 counts including racketeering, federal program bribery, attempted extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion and using interstate commerce to facilitate an unlawful activity.Andrews, 73, is charged with one count of attempted extortion, one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, two counts of using interstate commerce to facilitate an unlawful activity, and one count of making a false statement to the FBI.A third defendant, real estate developer Charles Cui, 52, is facing counts unrelated to the Burger King scheme.[ Ex-Ald. Ed Burke corruption trial: Evidence seen and heard by the jury ]On Thursday afternoon, prosecutors called Warren Johnson, the Palatine-based architect in charge of the Burger King remodel, who testified he was very surprised when he was notified by his project manager that Andrews had ordered the work stopped in October 2017.Johnson testified he found it “highly unusual” that the driveway permit issue came up only after they were issued their building permit for the project, and that he’d “never” had a job shut down in the dozens of similar projects he’d undertaken in the city before.He immediately sent an email to the assistant commissioner of buildings, calling it “quite disturbing.”“This does not seem right that Burke can shut this project down considering we have our (building) permit,” Johnson wrote in the email.Jurors, meanwhile, have already heard what was going on behind the scenes via a wiretapped phone call between Burke and Andrews. On Oct. 24, 2017, Burke called Andrews to say he’d just driven by the Burger King and it appeared work was still being done.Burke asked Andrews what the issue was that was supposed to block the work: “Why was I able to hold it up? What did they need from me?”“They needed ... driveway permits and everything signed off on,” Andrews said.“Well,” Burke said, “I don’t remember signing off on any driveway permits.”About 90 minutes after that call, Andrews ordered the project shut down, according to testimony.Listen to the call:On cross-examination, Johnson grew visibly flustered as defense attorneys drilled down on his team’s own missteps, first by failing to get a driveway permit, followed by months of confusion and delay on their part before they finally were approved in November 2017.In his questioning, Duffy caught Johnson saying he’d actually delegated his assistant Tracy Willie to submit the original plans for the Burger King renovation to the city, even though the rules state that only architects themselves can do so.Johnson later corrected himself to say he wasn’t sure who submitted the application, Willie or him.“We had hundreds of permits in the city of Chicago. ... I have to recollect that, and maybe she did, maybe I did,” Johnson said.“So the answer to my question now is that you’re not sure?” Duffy asked.“Yes,” Johnson replied.“Oh — OK,” Duffy said.During that line of questioning, Burke leaned back in his chair at the defense table and smiled while he crossed his arms over his chest.Duffy closed by asking Johnson whether there was any “urgency” to get the driveway permit.“Define that,” Johnson shot back.“It took you two months to get a driveway permit?” Duffy asked.“I don’t remember if the time lag was because of their backlog or something,” Johnson snapped, prompting Duffy to ask whether the delay was due to Johnson’s own firm not being diligent.“I don’t think so. I don’t agree,” Johnson said.Todd Pugh, an attorney for Andrews, picked up where Duffy left off, showing Johnson an email where he said his employee had gone to City Hall on Nov. 14, 2017, to apply for the driveway permits.But Johnson testified earlier he went down personally. “It was a long time ago,” Johnson said when confronted with the email.Pugh also asked Johnson why it took so long to file this driveway permit when it’s all of two pages.“It’s not just filing out a two-page application,” Johnson said in an exasperated tone. “There’s a lot of things that architect need to do to prepare for that.”jmeisner@chicagotribune.comrlong@chicagotribune.commcrepeau@chicagotribune.com",10601,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-ald-ed-burke-corruption-trial-day-17-20231207-tfdnxcdxezfx5dnfv4rw3x2l3m-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/YVV0gbW8-hpPtK8S_QMNLX9NKUU=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(3935x1792:3945x1802)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/JKCLYLCORJGHJPKN37HZLF5HKI.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country player clearer chicago confront ongoing smile line pugh urge unusual kind handwrite trial charge guarantee submit annual large wiretapped agent andrew zone project defendant raju personally leave company matter assistant burke put law recollect day told funeral democratic delayed key lean pulaski alderman fix conspiracy drink department head rear evidence pam cross glassware paper tentative dishevel zohaib aide history espinoza donation construction october memorandum private willie duffy agree site page dhananis simply reference turn filing former search knew original printout solis kulbacki acknowledge michael found fundraiser wire introduce desk team cooperate wood pension fully snap defense corruptly photo label tax assure shut special sticky edward fail houston city table driveway expect flag backlog laid plan road commit butcher work influential obvious chris tuesday hundred blue part building week approve serve finally permit delay wrap union food manager aggressively note aloud drawing earlier federal include grow screen activity memo arrive father klafter raid juror widely employee sushma club hold order time house office shot testimony testify show daniel tone propose block location fill separate noticeable prompt read machine area committee afternoon warren heard lot dozen jury november record share top minute back opt shelf interior argument promise owner addition instruction interstate expert stop long prospect inch overmeiren close firm caught unrelated corruption hall joseph hallway similar define application unlawful rule christmas urgency regard correct email mention deal review allege representation property knickknack write prosecution kevin chairman happy emb madigan undertaken push beverly crime bossy leather file wikipedia delve colleague folder chelsy begin tracy consider local accord due gair information transportation drill king fed basically false witness political commerce signing exasperate brown commissioner paragraph stack answer home jmeisner west prepare sign scene sox mole unprecedented helpful center ago speaker delegate print scheme friday picture year immediately verdict lag thejurors conviction follow shoukat prince attend driven remodel picked prosecutor oddity defer bribery visibly criminal case solid program fbi politician extortion remember morning number charles judge party make schedule sticker estate enigma discussion developer kendall centerpiece analysis suppose jersey opening hire remind lawyer recent ward architectural hour confusion recording admit satisfied legal campaign pressure surprised cub chair pitch month job date question add attorney johnson david phone highly ald lead racketeering notify state descend restaurant finance street facilitate furnish big bos window focus collect lunch league mccarthy virginia document run burger council misstep real point architect left undercover fluster thursday statement issue credibility potentially apply renovation count accept closer arm business attempt district longtime dhanani call impeach series,0.68725,0.11319686821997924,9.601119842829075,0.44462722462722437,0
Chicago Tribune,Corruption trial of ex-Ald. Edward Burke: What you need to know,2023-12-07 19:19:00,"Jason Meisner, Ray Long, Megan Crepeau","The historic corruption trial of former Chicago Ald. Edward Burke has begun.The son of a Democratic ward boss and alderman, Burke, 79, served more than 50 years on the City Council and allegedly ran the Finance Committee like his own personal fiefdom before his office was dramatically raided by the FBI in November 2018.Burke is charged with 14 counts, including racketeering, federal program bribery, attempted extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion and using interstate commerce to facilitate an unlawful activity.At the heart of the indictment are more than 100 secretly recorded meetings and phone calls prosecutors plan to play that allegedly show Burke using his elected office to win benefits for himself, mostly through business for his private law firm.Burke’s defense team, meanwhile, will try to show that Burke’s maneuvering was nothing more than politics as usual.The crux of Burke’s defense will likely be to knock down Solis, who was caught in his own corruption scheme before agreeing in 2016 to become an FBI mole and secretly record Burke.The trial is expected to last about six weeks.Follow our writers — Jason Meisner, Megan Crepeau and Ray Long — for the latest news and see coverage throughout the trial below.Former Ald. Daniel Solis, whose unprecedented turn as an FBI mole helped the feds take down two princes of Chicago’s Democratic political machine, is expected to be called as a defense witness next week in the corruption trial of his former colleague, ex-Ald. Edward Burke.The undercover recordings made by Solis have been the centerpiece of Burke’s ongoing trial, but Solis himself has been something of an enigma. Prosecutors opted not to call Solis as their own witness, and while Burke’s lawyers promised the judge they’d call Solis, it was not mentioned to the jury in opening statements. Read more here.A former executive involved in the remodeling of a Southwest Side Burger King testified Wednesday that an early meeting about the project where then-Ald. Edward Burke demanded charitable donations and other concessions “felt like a shakedown.”Jeff MacDonald, who was in charge in the early stages of the renovation of the restaurant in Burke’s 14th Ward, also told the jury in Burke’s corruption trial that the alderman asked him at the end of the March 2017 meeting who did the property tax work for MacDonald’s Houston-based bosses.MacDonald testified his response to Burke was “that I didn’t know, and that it was probably done out of Houston,” adding that Burke seemed “irritated” and the whole meeting, which was also attended by Burke’s longtime ward aide Peter Andrews Jr., made him “uncomfortable.” Read more here.The son of a Texas-based fast-food restaurant tycoon told a federal jury Tuesday he was “taken aback” when then-Ald. Ed Burke seemed to draw a direct link between helping with permit issues for their Southwest Side Burger King renovation and hiring Burke’s private law firm to do property tax appeals.

It was Edward M. Burke. Read more here.The behind-the-scenes intrigue surrounding the Old Post Office renovation is the centerpiece of the high-profile trial and was the focus of the third week of testimony, where prosecutors unleashed a memorable string of dozens of secret audio and video recordings of Burke playing the dual role of City Hall powerhouse and private lawyer prowling for legal work.Prosecutors said Friday they have about a week of evidence left to present in their case in chief.The recordings showed Burke welcoming the post office developer, Harry Skydell, and his son at one City Hall meeting, then sliding two Klafter & Burke business cards toward them. Later, he was caught on camera smirking as he told Solis he was reluctant to help Skydell because “the cash register has not rung yet.” Read more here.After two years of exhaustive pursuit, Chicago Ald. Edward Burke had finally landed “the tuna.”And then it got away.That was the story heard in Burke’s corruption trial Friday, where jurors have been shown evidence all week about the then-powerful Finance Committee chairman’s alleged chase of private legal work from the developers in the $600 million makeover of the Old Post Office.Wiretaps played in court captured Burke referring to getting business from the project’s developer, Harry Skydell, as “landing the tuna.” Read more here.One of the most crucial pieces of evidence in the sprawling racketeering indictment against Ed Burke was presented in court Wednesday.Burke had just finished pitching his private law firm to the developers of the Old Post Office in October 2016 when he asked his assistant to bring in some pamphlets and business cards.Unbeknownst to Burke, his colleague, then-Ald. Daniel Solis had a hidden video camera pointing right at him as Burke wrote something down on the back of the Klafter & Burke materials and slid it over Harry Skydell and his son, who had flown in from New York to meet Burke face to face. Read more here.Chicago Ald. Daniel Solis was a newly minted FBI mole in August 2016 when he was instructed to call his then-powerful colleague, Ald. Ed Burke, and talk about the massive $600 million renovation of the Old Post Office.After some seemingly innocuous conversation about the project’s New York-based developers and local contractors who’d be vying for work, Burke made an unsolicited comment that surely perked up the ears of the FBI agents listening in the wire room.“Well, while you’re at it, recommend the good firm of Klafter & Burke to do the tax work,” Burke told Solis on the Aug. 26, 2016, recording, which was played for the jury in Burke’s corruption trial Tuesday. Read more here.The testimony came as the historic trial was supposed to see its first full week starting Monday after an unexpectedly slow jury selection, followed by a COVID-19 diagnosis for one of the defense attorneys and a shortened week for the Thanksgiving holiday put the proceedings behind schedule.U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall has said that despite the delays, she still expected the trial to finish by the Christmas holiday, which is now just four weeks away.

Edward Burke’s City Hall offices in November 2018, four federal agents more than a thousand miles away descended on the home of Houston-area fast food restaurant tycoon Shoukat Dhanani.When Dhanani answered his door that day in Sugar Land, Texas, the agents immediately assured him he was not in any trouble, but said they were investigating Burke and needed to ask him some questions about a Burger King that Dhanani had purchased and renovated in the 14th Ward, Dhanani told a federal jury in Chicago on Wednesday.

Edward Burke to ask for his support for the museum’s proposal for a fee increase in September 2017 when he caught her off guard with an immediately chilly demeanor.“Well, uh, I was surprised to hear from you —to be very frank,” a gruff-sounding Burke said to Bekken on the Sept. 8, 2017, call, which was secretly being recorded by the FBI. Burke grew more icy as he explained that he’d recommended a good friend’s daughter for an internship at the Field Museum but never heard back.

He was a bribe-taker and he was an extortionist,” Chapman told jurors in opening statements Thursday at Burke’s landmark racketeering trial.For the defense, Burke attorney Chris Gair painted Burke as a zealous public servant, a proud lawyer and an enthusiastic Chicagoan who made all those phone calls simply to help people. “This is a bribery case without bribes and an extortion case without extortion,” he said.

Edward Burke finally expected headed to opening statements Thursday after a jury was empaneled. Read more here.The trial had been scheduled to kick off in earnest a week earlier. But soon after convening the fourth day of proceedings on Nov. 9, U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall announced that one of the lawyers in the case was sick and two others were not feeling well, forcing her to tell everyone to stay away from courthouse.“Sorry for this news, but it is in our time,” Kendall said. “Stay healthy, and make sure you drink your orange juice and get your sleep. Because we have work to do.”Unlike previous trial days, everyone on Burke’s team was wearing masks, including the former alderman, as were prosecutors at the table across from them. Attorneys for one of Burke’s co-defendants, Charles Cui, appeared by phone. Read more here.A total of 54 potential jurors were questioned over three days, with 37 making it through “for cause” strikes to the next round.The pace of jury selection was markedly slow.Potential jurors were asked in granular detail about their social media presence, their gaming habits, their pets and their relationship with some of the entities that figure into the indictment: Binny’s Beverage Depot, Burger King and the U.S. Postal Service.Among those questioned were a man who has a rescue snake named Medusa and two geckos named after animé characters, a homemaker who moderates a Jane Austen fan website and a 20-year-old junior college student who works as a host at a chef Gordon Ramsay restaurant in the suburbs.

Chicago Tribune,Caretaker gets 55-year sentence in stabbing deaths of elderly couple in Algonquin,2023-12-07 18:41:00,Robert McCoppin,"A woman who pleaded guilty but mentally ill in the stabbing deaths of an elderly couple she had been caring for in Algonquin was sentenced to 55 years in prison, officials said Thursday.Arin Fox, 42, entered the plea to a first-degree murder charge in the deaths of Noreen Gilard, 69, and Leonard Gilard, 73, in their home in the 600 block of Red Coach Lane in the far northwest suburb, McHenry County prosecutors said.Fox had been living with the couple and was their informal caretaker while Noreen Gilard was bedridden, according to testimony at the sentencing hearing. After the Nov. 6, 2020, killings, Fox stole cash and the victims’ car, packed with her belongings, and drove to Colorado, prosecutors said in a news release.The next day, she checked herself into a psychiatric facility, where she told a nurse she had harmed the Gilards, prosecutors said. Their bodies were found after a well-being check.Under her plea agreement, Fox faced a sentencing range of 40 to 60 years for one count of first-degree murder, and the other count was dropped. Judge James Cowlin handed down the sentence Wednesday.Fox had a documented long-term mental health history, prosecutors said, as well as a history of criminal conduct and substance abuse.rmccoppin@chicagotribune.com",1270,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-algonquin-double-murder-sentence-20231207-j6af7a2ptvfbnjmb7fnacfudqu-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/M5x9Mns6IJ_nNay3kGLPBsdAVmQ=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/UJHAR53CP5HEJEHR7SB5HFR7TI.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,fox victim stole enter car nurse criminal cash leonard accord coach drove range guilty lane suburb mchenry judge gilards document checked belonging charge drop facility history hand algonquin couple living mental murder sentence colorado northwest woman packed james gilard red health conduct body home elderly psychiatric killing news stab county testimony agreement count year bedridden block mentally hearing plea death day noreen prison cowlin caretaker told found substance plead harm informal prosecutor official,-0.9864999999999999,0.23622047244094488,10.455555555555552,0.5213888888888889,0
Chicago Tribune,Former NFL player Sergio Brown pleads not guilty to killing his mother in Maywood,2023-12-07 18:41:00,Jake Sheridan,"Former NFL player Sergio Brown pleaded not guilty to killing his mother during an arraignment Wednesday.Brown was charged with first-degree murder in the September death of his mother, Myrtle Simmons-Brown, who prosecutors said he lived with in Maywood.The 35-year-old who played for seven seasons as a safety for the New England Patriots, Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills was also charged with concealment of a homicidal death, court records show.He pleaded not guilty to the concealment charge and two murder charges, the Cook County state’s attorney’s office said.The disappearance of Brown after police discovered his mother’s body wrapped in a sheet near a creek close to their home drew national attention. Brown resurfaced days after the gruesome finding in expletive-filled social media posts calling reports tying him to his mother’s death “fake news.”Three weeks after police found Simmons-Brown’s body, Mexican authorities detained the former Proviso East High School and University of Notre Dame football player in Mexico City and deported him to San Diego, where he was held in custody, prosecutors said in October.According to an autopsy performed by the Cook County medical examiner’s office, Simmons-Brown died of blunt-force trauma.A search of Brown’s residence revealed Ajax in a bathtub drain, indicating the tub had recently been cleaned, prosecutors said. His mother’s iPad, credit cards and phone were missing, but her cigarettes were left behind, court documents said.Cameras in the area captured Brown burning items in a fire pit the evening of Sept. 14, and police later found burned fabric in of the pit.Cellphone activity was discovered during the investigation and showed cellphones of the mother and son pinging together Sept. 14 and 15, before they stopped pinging altogether, prosecutors said. When Brown was extradited U.S. Border and Customs Patrol found his mother’s cellphone, iPad and credit cards in a bag Brown was carrying, prosecutors said.Brown is next scheduled to appear in court Jan. 24.jsheridan@chicagotribune.com",2085,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-sergio-brown-not-guilty-plea-20231207-gxd5nzqsgfd2plj65mie45nk7u-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/WkR4Xqear5LO9bfpXSCoZL3UVz8=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/ZLX3HGX4C5DITDOHAVA7IBQ754.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police player september social drain record investigation disappearance autopsy kill altogether fire guilty jacksonville examiner buffalo schedule mexico ping patriot charge england stop cook court ajax custody city card close sheet perform resurface body patrol tie medical county dame recently indianapolis extradite fake attorney day death find phone football mother season week plead state school san bill arraignment medium wrap high clean carry cigarette residence live myrtle document activity bag bathtub brown attention reveal left played pit cellphone ipad nfl murder burning sergio indicate home university mexican detain miss item proviso custom office authority border show safety national colt gruesome former jaguar deport search east credit concealment discover post creek capture tub burn held report diego found fabric drew call homicidal area prosecutor,-0.92945,0.4316546762589928,12.7182271468144,0.358956228956229,0

Chicago Tribune,"Suspect in Romeoville killings threatened to ‘take everyone down’ before family of 4 was found dead, cops say",2023-12-07 18:36:00,Caroline Kubzansky,"The prime suspect in a quadruple homicide of a Romeoville family had a romantic relationship with one of the victims he is believed to have killed in September, Romeoville police said Thursday.Authorities said their investigation into the deaths of Alberto Rolon, 38, Zoraida Bartolomei, 32, and their young sons was not complete, but they confirmed that the suspect, Nathaniel Huey Jr., 31, had been in a relationship with Bartolomei.Both Bartolomei’s husband and Huey’s girlfriend, Ermalinda Palomo, were aware of the relationship, police said.The couple and their children, ages 7 and 9, were found shot to death in their home in the 500 block of Concord Avenue on Sept. 17. Huey and Palomo died days later in an explosive car crash in Oklahoma.Huey had been acting “sketchy” and reportedly told someone “I didn’t do anything” two days before police found the pair with gunshot wounds in the wrecked car, records show.Romeoville police said their investigation indicated Palomo was aware of Huey’s intent to commit the homicides, participated in the planning and drove Huey to and from the family’s home in Romeoville.A Sept. 17 Romeoville police bulletin obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request named Huey as a suspect in the quadruple homicide, advised that he had stopped going to work and that he was aware police were pursuing him, describing him as acting “irrational and erratic.”The bulletin also described Huey as having had “extensive firearm training and experience.” Huey was the proprietor of a company called Black Bear Security, state records show.A Sept. 19 Streamwood police report states that about a month before Romeoville police found the family shot to death at home, Palomo had asked Huey to leave, prompting him to threaten to “take everyone down.”According to the report, another member of Huey’s household called police around 11:30 p.m. Sept. 19 to report Palomo as a missing person. The unidentified caller said Palomo had left the house earlier that day and described her as “fearful.”“She was very scared and kept telling (the caller) ‘I love you,’” the report stated.The caller told Streamwood police that Huey was aggressive and said Palomo and Huey had been together since 2016. The caller also told police that Palomo had said she would turn herself in to Romeoville police and that she and Huey were planning to go to his mother’s house.The police report states that shortly after midnight on Sept. 20, someone made contact with Palomo via text and told her to come home. Palomo responded “OK.”“The phone was shut off moments later,” the report said.Later that morning, police in Catoosa, Oklahoma, found Huey dead and Palomo critically injured with gunshot wounds in a crashed, burning vehicle at the conclusion of a chase. Palomo died shortly afterward in a local hospital.Palomo’s family attorney JohnPaul Ivec said in a September statement that Palomo “had nothing to do” with the killings in Romeoville and that her family was “in shock and grieving.”“We know without a shadow of a doubt that at the time of the murders in Romeoville, Ermalinda was home sleeping,” Ivec said. “This has been confirmed with multiple family members.”“She communicated with a number of family members, telling them things like ‘I love you’ and ‘take care of my grandbabies,’” Ivec continued. “She seemed upset.”Ivec did not immediately return phone and email requests for comment.Palomo’s ex-husband, Anthony Tomei, described her as a happy person with a good sense of humor and an engaged parent who raised her five children to be respectful of others.“She was a loving mother. She tried to be there for (her kids) as much as she could,” he said.Romeoville police said in their statement that there was no evidence of additional suspects.CKubzansky@chicagotribune.com",3805,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-romeoville-victim-five-20231005-20231208-j4ufsex2lrf53heuo5uyuljjka-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/L8ySQRiNH1c5B8GQlFTuckiQ1Bc=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/UEDY52LKPBB6XHPI3OQFSROPDM.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police bulletin victim raise september respond person wound record firearm investigation complete return morning number threaten romeoville kill describe aware request gunshot bear doubt make relationship caller shut advise stop planning vehicle unidentified continued intent pursue described crashed oklahoma husband alberto moment girlfriend household family text killing commit respectful tomei leave believe work shadow shortly company month email attorney conclusion day death chase phone told avenue black multiple happy mother love child streamwood state nathaniel participate suspect johnpaul extensive proprietor afterward zoraida car aggressive parent local evidence contact bartolomei accord prime romantic earlier information drove ermalinda concord crash engage huey couple reportedly left murder injured burning explosive indicate home time midnight sleep miss grandbabies statement young additional house critically irrational shot rolon ivec confirm pair turn obtain training block immediately humor freedom dead age shock wreck sketchy anthony act member quadruple report security found prompt scar kid call catoosa palomo communicate homicide,-0.97105,0.39421813403416556,9.658651994497934,0.3973015873015872,0
Chicago Tribune,"Recommended changes to transit head to state lawmakers, who could debate expanded sales tax and consolidating agencies",2023-12-07 18:36:00,Sarah Freishtat,"A sweeping set of recommendations about what Chicago-area transit could look like in the future has been sent to the state legislature, setting the stage for lawmakers to debate potentially thorny issues about funding for public transit and whether the CTA, Metra and Pace should be consolidated into one agency.The report, drafted by regional planners after meetings with community organizations, lays out recommendations to address public transit funding, governance and the experience of riding buses and trains, as the region’s three public transit agencies face a looming financial cliff and languishing ridership numbers. Among the options included are additional taxes, such as expanding the sales tax base, and two options to revamp oversight of the region’s separate transit agencies.But some of the options are likely to be contentious among influential business groups, which have already raised concerns about expanding taxes, and suburban and city representatives vying for influence on transit agency boards.Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle supports consolidating the transit agencies. At a ceremony to formally hand the report to lawmakers Thursday morning, she said she also supported recommendations to raise $1.5 billion in new public revenue for transit — the more expensive of two funding options — but reform, and changes to the decades-old way public transit funding is distributed to the three agencies, is needed first, she said.“Even if our transit agencies work together well now, there have been many years, decades even, in which the service boards were at cross-purposes,” she said. “To solve the transit system’s problems we have to show unity of purpose with our policies leading in one direction.”Chicago Chief Operating Officer John Roberson said at the ceremony Mayor Brandon Johnson was committed to working with the rest of the region and lawmakers in Springfield to address public transit’s needs. He did not address the mayor’s view on consolidating the agencies but instead focused largely on funding, saying transit has been chronically underfunded for decades and lack of investment is an equity issue.“We are already seeing the beginnings of what the cost of inaction can look like,” he said. “We need a more robust system that will attract more riders back to downtown.”The report came from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which was tasked by the legislature with drafting recommendations as the region’s public transit agencies face a combined $730 million budget hole once federal COVID-19 relief funding starts running out in 2025. Transit agencies have warned that failure to plug the hole could lead to catastrophic service cuts and fare increases.Regional ridership also has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Public transit, which has long served downtown office commuters, is facing a fundamental shift as typical commuting patterns change and more white-collar employees work from home.Now, lawmakers will choose how to move forward with the recommendations.The CMAP report includes two sets of proposals with two price tags. One calls for $1 billion in new public funding annually, and the other $1.5 billion. Both also call for the transit agencies to generate another $200 million through fares or savings.The new money could include increased funding for existing free, reduced-fare and paratransit programs, raising regular fares and expanding programs to keep fares affordable for low-income riders and youth.A key idea includes expanding the sales tax so that it applies to some types of services and potentially also raising the rate that goes to Chicago-area transit, though that could be paired with lowering the rate in the rest of the state. Also under consideration are driver fees, such as a surcharge on vehicle registration costs.The recommendations also address service, including improvements to the bus system, adding “transit ambassadors” to boost safety and the perception of safety, and moving to one fare system across all types of public transit, instead of maintaining largely separate fares for the CTA, Metra and Pace.The service and funding changes are paired with recommendations to change the way transit is overseen in the region. Currently, the CTA, Metra and Pace are each operated by a separate agency, and the Regional Transportation Authority coordinates financing.The recommendations could include simply strengthening the RTA and keeping the separate agencies, or folding the three transit agencies into one entity, an idea that has been floated before but never gained traction. Whether the concept would gain enough traction this time around remains to be seen.In an August letter, Preckwinkle and leaders of DuPage, Lake, Kane, Will and McHenry counties expressed support for consolidating the region’s transit agencies and giving more control to suburban elected officials.Thursday, Preckwinkle said she supports many of the other recommendations in the report, which line up with goals the county outlined in its own transit plan. A proposal to expand reduced fare programs to low-income riders — similar to a new Cook County-backed pilot program for Metra riders — would be a key step toward transit equity, she said. Integrating fares across the three transit agencies is also a top priority for the county.“Sustainable funding sources for all transportation modes are critical to a strong, resilient transportation system,” she said. “And our transit system is part of the economic foundation of our region.”Funding recommendations that call for added taxes, including expanding the sales tax base, have already been met with opposition. Jack Lavin, CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, said the city is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic and now is not the time to think about expanding taxes.“We’re trying to get people back downtown,” he said. “We’re trying to get people shopping and (focus on) retail corridors across the city.”The chamber was part of a group that advised CMAP while drafting the report, and Lavin said he supports many of the recommendations around governance of the systems and ensuring they operate efficiently. A strong transit system is key to Chicago’s success, he said.But before going to taxpayers for more money, he said, transit oversight and operations need to be addressed. A better customer experience could make riders more willing to pay higher fares, he said.“If we’re going to ask taxpayers to reach deeper into their pockets, we need to see these reforms,” he said. “We need to see a more efficient, reliable transit system that embraces technology and can help all of these areas be more efficient, accessible, safe and clean.”State Sen. Ram Villivalam, a Chicago Democrat who sponsored the bill tasking CMAP with drafting the recommendations, said review of the way the region’s transit agencies are governed is sorely needed to ensure greater accountability and transparency for residents. There will be differing views on funding, but any conversation about money comes with an understanding that public transit also needs to be safe, reliable, accessible and environmentally conscious, he said.“I do strongly believe there is a commitment from the Illinois General Assembly, in a way there hasn’t been in the past, to look at funding and not be adverse to funding programs that will positively benefit the constituents that we serve,” he said. “Obviously, the question is how. And the second question is, is the funding going to create the system that we believe our residents deserve.”sfreishtat@chicagotribune.com",7608,https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/transportation/ct-biz-future-of-transit-report-cmap-preckwinkle-20231208-6avakm7vjbfk7p4x4r6uuhsdka-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/W6jty7BgMrwGKSw8DJ2g2RiQkgY=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/K23O3W4CGJAEFJWKBRHSNPEYM4.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,funding raise governance vie metropolitan ridership taxpayer increase chicago change top back conscious return springfield perception line generate conversation public coordinate preckwinkle remains resilient critical advise positively tag long typical distribute vehicle fundamental illinois villivalam service economic catastrophic fare ceo free agency type warn reduce rider similar accessible strong hole consolidate view pattern democrat lay address system govern effect constituent draft robust maintain start rta commute review express decade key cost level environmentally outline reach beginning expand contentious metra bill lower roberson financial cliff inaction efficiently train move equity plug august john transportation benefit annually entity past price sfreishtat commerce technology experience suburban region unity stage board meeting tasked set loom operation customer million pace combine idea commitment applies simply formally driver accountability embrace safety attract exist toni overseen opposition fee year lack boost resident understand step regional brandon underfunded transparency consolidated report sustainable downtown affordable leader rest recommendation integrate sweep differ cta sponsor rate lake recover program operate strongly morning number operating mchenry foundation tax make solve planning cook chief hand commuter forward city policy relief bus largely concern instead influence paratransit dupage plan safe commit success believe pocket work county consideration influential option support transit president choose investment lawmaker ceremony question revamp add concept jack part johnson efficient group revenue debate purpose pandemic failure strengthen improvement expensive base chamber goal lead state proposal priority serve shift elect task retail control languish rid representative high regular focus future pay federal deeper include registration oversight mayor traction general chronically run budget kane give money chicagoland ensure sorely employee planner corridor time thursday cut reliable lavin issue additional adverse fold office authority float potentially pilot reform problem show letter pair ram shopping legislature create surcharge thorny source separate business ambassador assembly billion great community call currently organization area officer cmap,0.99605,0.07886435331230283,11.67564444444444,0.44131496075940524,0
Chicago Tribune,City Council committee rejects discipline provision in Chicago police contract but OKs pay hikes,2023-12-07 17:55:00,"Sam Charles, A.D. Quig","Setting the stage for a potential legal fight and protracted turmoil between Chicago’s largest police union and Mayor Brandon Johnson, a City Council committee on Thursday opposed a contract provision that would allow officers accused of serious misconduct to have their cases decided by a third party behind closed doors.The committee recommendation rejecting the contract stipulation now heads to a vote next week before the full City Council, which, if it agrees with the committee, would kill a major part of the contract between the union representing rank-and-file officers and Johnson’s administration.The provision would allow officers accused of misconduct to remove their cases from the Chicago Police Board docket and instead have them decided privately by an outside third party. It was the most controversial part of the proposed deal as public officials and critics said it subverted police reform efforts and took accusations of police misconduct out of the public eye.But in a separate vote Thursday, council members on the committee OK’d all the economic benefits included in the contract for rank-and-file officers, including 5% raises this year and next.The workforce committee’s 10-5 vote actually aligned with the balancing act Johnson has tried to strike in his handling of the Chicago Police Department.The mayor pledged on the campaign trail to not raise CPD’s budget, then pivoted to propose a spending plan that allocated a record $2 billion to the department, including the $60 million in planned bonuses and raises in the new police contract. While the department’s bottom line rose, Johnson reshuffled positions to reduce the number of beat cops and boost civilian positions and those dedicated to fulfilling the department’s consent decree requirements.When the contract was tentatively agreed on less than two months ago, it was hailed as a great success for Johnson. But that quickly changed.The late October announcement of an agreement between Johnson and the Fraternal Order of Police represented Johnson’s first major union deal since taking office. FOP President John Catanzara — who once warned of an exodus of officers and “blood in the streets” if Johnson prevailed in the election — called it “the best possible result at the end of the process.”But the show of harmony was short-lived.Days after both sides celebrated the deal Johnson said he would seek to split up the vote on the contract: one to handle the economic package and another to address the disciplinary change. He urged members of the City Council to vote no on the provision allowing officers the option to have some of the most serious disciplinary cases heard by an independent third party behind closed doors rather than publicly before the Chicago Police Board.“Ultimately, we will not allow this to undermine our efforts to advance reform, increase transparency and implement our vision for improved public safety and policing to make our city better, stronger, and safer,” Johnson said in a statement at the time.The closed-door option was part of an arbitration award handed down earlier this year by arbitrator Edwin Benn during contract negotiations between the city and FOP.Some aldermen and reform advocates, including Ald. Matt Martin, 47th, said that provision “flies in the face” of efforts to strengthen transparency and accountability mechanisms in the wake of the murder of Laquan McDonald. Police Board hearings are open to the public, and the board’s decisions in the most serious disciplinary cases are also made publicly available. Misconduct cases overseen by a third party would be conducted out of public view.But Catanzara said a no vote on the disciplinary issue would guarantee a costly and ultimately fruitless legal fight for the city, pledging to return to arbitration.To concur with the rejection, the full City Council must do so on a vote of three-fifths — or 30 — of its members. If that happens and the council rejects the arbitrator’s award, that rejection and the council’s reasons will be sent back to Benn. If Benn adheres to his original decision or modifies it, that decision will come back to the City Council once again. If aldermen repeat their rejection, the issue could then be taken to Cook County court.“The standards to reverse an arbitrator’s award are limited and very challenging,” the city’s chief labor counsel, Jim Franczek, told aldermen.Catanzara was more blunt in his assessment in October.“The city’s gonna lose,” he said at the time.On Thursday, Catanzara was among several high-profile speakers who addressed the committee before the vote.Entering City Hall around 11 a.m. after walking through a small anti-FOP protest on LaSalle Street, he stressed the city’s place in labor history.“Whether it’s appreciated or not, the FOP is a union,” he said, adding that any future legal action would be a waste of time.“All you are doing is postponing the inevitable,” Catanzara said of any effort to vote down the arbitration award. “It is a fight you will not end up winning.”But Ghian Foreman, the outgoing president of the Chicago Police Board, said approving the arbitration award “would be a serious setback for police accountability in Chicago.”There’s a “clear difference” between the FOP and other unions, added Ald. Andre Vasquez, 40th.“Other unions don’t have the right to kill or imprison anyone … yes, they also save lives, they also protect the people that need it,” he said. “That is why, when we talk about what justice looks like, a Police Board, along with other bodies established, provide transparency and nuance in that decision-making. Because the public deserves to know why decisions were made.”Vasquez said he hoped the FOP would partner with the city to propose a public arbitration process at least, “because you’re gutting the Police Board to the point of nonexistence, which isn’t open government and isn’t good government.”Anjanette Young, a social worker whose Near West Side home was the target of a bad CPD search in 2019, referenced the hundreds of millions of dollars approved by the City Council in recent years to settle lawsuits stemming from alleged police misconduct. Young’s lawsuit against the city was settled for $2.9 million, and the Police Board voted earlier this year to fire the sergeant who oversaw the botched raid.“Paying out lawsuits is not justice,” said Young, who wore a shirt with the phrase “I AM HER” in all capital letters. “If you vote yes on this, you are being reckless with all of our tax dollars. I pay taxes, and my own tax money paid me for my trauma. That’s not OK.”After the vote rejecting the contract provision, Young stood and applauded.But Ald. Anthony Beale, 9th, was among the five council committee members to support the arbitration award. He said he was “extremely troubled” by the tentative contract being divided into two votes.What’s more, Beale said, it was all but certain that Benn, the arbitrator, would send the proposal right back to the City Council if it’s voted down next week.“There’s always things within contracts that we don’t like,” Beale said. “Whether we like it or not, I think it’s our job to go ahead and ratify this contract and move on.“I think it’ll cost us more money in the long run, even if it goes back to the arbitrator,” Beale added. “Because if we reject this, it’s going to go back to the arbitrator, and the same person that sent it to us is going to receive it, and they’re going to turn right around and say, ‘I told you, this is my decision,’ and it’s going to come right back to us.”The proposed contract’s economic package approved by the committee, meanwhile, provides CPD officers with a nearly 20% pay raise over four years, in addition to a one-time $2,500 bonus for all officers and an annual $2,000 bonus for cops with more than 20 years on the job.Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the FOP reached a deal boosting officer pay two years ago, including $365 million in retroactive pay increases dating back to 2017 and a series of new accountability measures.But several issues were left unresolved for Johnson’s administration to pick up. Compared with the deal the FOP struck with Lightfoot, the economic package approved by the committee Thursday more than doubles the raises officers were entitled to in 2024 and 2025. It also includes sweeteners for other positions the department is seeking to fill.Donna Rowling, the commander of the CPD’s labor relations division, said the agreement gives Chicago police Superintendent Larry Snelling “the runway needed to implement the transformational changes needed to better the department, improve overall morale, assist with recruiting and retention efforts, and puts us on a good path to achieve consent decree compliance.”The agreement will add incentives to attract recruits to the department’s field training program, crisis intervention teams, and bike officer ranks. It also will give management control to fill positions in CPD’s public transportation unit, rather than mostly relying on seniority, she said.The contract also “removes impediments” to creating a new homicide teams pilot program, which Rowling said will help improve clearance rates. The changes will add a third night shift for detectives, allowing investigators to respond to homicide scenes during the overnight hours, when evidence is best preserved and witness memories are freshest.Franczek said the deal “is the longest contract ever negotiated between the city and the FOP,” lasting technically from July of 2017 through the end of June 2027.“This contract took the longest time to negotiate in the history of the city of Chicago, six and a half years or 78 months. The follow-up, second longest, was a mere 52 months. This contract was by far the most difficult to negotiate,” spanning three mayoral administrations, he said.The agreement also includes a paid parental leave policy and “enshrines several accountability measures” that are part of the federal court-ordered consent decree the department remains under following the 2014 murder of McDonald by a Chicago police officer.scharles@chicagotribune.comaquig@chicagotribune.com",10136,https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-fop-arbitration-hearing-20231207-gzwoofexgrdjrhhcdj4mtexeqm-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/L97CGCC34oemN3LVYDFeVjFH1gE=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BTRU766ROJAMFOS3R7OJ7WEE24.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,raise increase chicago reshuffle assist change blood line public settle ratify urge arbitration remains guarantee beale major half lose independent rank large economic annual adheres entitle body strong leave deserves edwin harmony address nonexistence phrase difficult receive relation detective put rely labor told cost critic alderman imprison consent department dedicate head strike mechanism partner move evidence inevitable john tentative potential capital late history october measure stipulation set action wake docket advocate agree ghian split bike reference turn accuse lightfoot original life search overseen workforce anjanette field beat botch rejection provision controversial waste concur result clear preserve pledge larry team unresolved quickly disciplinary struck social rate justice postpone tax cook misconduct spending hand subvert city policy administration crisis enshrines contract paid stood achieve plan superintendent option safer implement support president hundred part strengthen vasquez week proposal approve remove mayoral shift seek union oversaw challenge save lasalle wore decide position earlier pay recruit federal include turmoil lori costly give money night protest murder balance order time hop office standard reform show provide letter pilot commander cop propose ultimately snelling matt intervention create election hearing fill incentive anthony separate benn great reject lawsuit committee police homicide heard franczek reason available respond fly send record back return protract clearance fire addition celebrate side ahead improve bonus long fruitless reckless close accusation reduce warn hall appreciate compare full unit trail stem effort troubled tentatively hail handle retention open mcdonald represent deal allege impediment nuance rowling reach fulfil cpd package pivot transportation benefit establish exodus witness worker modifies small stage board advance reverse sergeant conduct million home west scene talk privately young limited accountability ago speaker safety fight fop pick attract year boost catanzara span brandon follow member act sweetener transformational transparency recruiting negotiation difference extremely official recommendation assessment martin person dollar runway double repeat june case program agrees number kill decree shirt gon negotiate blunt party make setback prevail chief andre technically possible july retroactive division instead recent seniority hour success bottom announcement county path legal campaign month job date add johnson publicly stress walk ald vision foreman place allocate street decision control gutting vote future process protect trauma mayor arbitrator run council budget point fraternal government left parental management thursday statement issue outgo award target memory agreement undermine training oppose overnight laquan investigator divide align billion rise counsel call officer civilian series,0.9848,0.14798737174427784,9.91993720565149,0.3645366362033028,0
Chicago Tribune,Northern sea otter pup rescued in Alaska finds new home at Shedd Aquarium,2023-12-07 17:40:00,Adriana Pérez,"In late October, a young sea otter pup was found in the remote coastal town of Seldovia, Alaska, stranded and calling out in distress with no mother in sight. After being rehabilitated, fed and healed, the tiny otter — barely over a month old — began a cross-country trip to his new home in Chicago.After being rescued by the Alaska SeaLife Center, the 10-pound male northern sea otter received a warm welcome at Shedd Aquarium in late November. He has remained behind the scenes at the aquarium, where animal care and veterinary staff are monitoring and caring for him around the clock.The newcomer will eventually join the five southern sea otters at Shedd — Luna, Cooper, Watson, Suri and Willow — who are also rescues. Temporarily referred to as Pup EL2306, he has been forming bonds with staff and reaching development milestones at the otter nursery before he can meet his peers and experience his new habitat at Shedd.Stranded sea otter pups require constant care: Aquarium staff feeds the new pup every three hours with formula in a bottle and small pieces of clam; they also groom him with soft towels and engage him with enrichment activities.In a news release, Shedd Aquarium said not many facilities in the United States have the space, staff and experience necessary to provide rescued otter pups with the care they require. Only 11 institutions, including Shedd, provide homes for sea otters that cannot be rereleased.Because sea otter pups depend heavily on their mothers for the first year of their lives, the federal government usually designates orphaned northern sea otter pups as non-releasable if they are found stranded when young.“At Shedd, we are dedicated to the care of animals here, there and everywhere; we stand ready to assist in times of need,” said Peggy Sloan, chief animal conservation officer at the aquarium. “With this newest addition to our rescued population of sea otters, we’re committed to his long-term care and continuing to create connections for Chicagoans to this important keystone species.”As keystone species, sea otters help maintain the balance of their ecosystems. For instance, they keep kelp forests healthy by eating sea urchins that graze on giant kelp; if otters disappeared, urchins would decimate kelp which many other species depend on for food and shelter.Northern sea otters are found in the Aleutian Islands, southern Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, California and as far as Japan. According to Shedd Aquarium, sea otter populations in south-central and southeast Alaska have stabilized or are increasing.But the last two decades have seen a decline of northern sea otter populations in southwest Alaska. Under the Endangered Species Act, they are considered “threatened.” According to Shedd, this is due to predation, overharvest, fishery interactions, disease and oil spills.The sea otter species as a whole is listed as “endangered” on the Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Commercial fishing and industrial pollution, as well as rising ocean temperatures due to climate change, are some of the ways in which human activities particularly endanger the species.Shedd will continue sharing updates on the pup’s development, when he can be expected to join the sea otter habitat, and plans around naming him. Last year, the aquarium let the public vote on Willow’s name.adperez@chicagotribune.com",3400,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/environment/ct-shedd-alaska-otter-pup-rescue-20231207-jcjxdt47vrby7c25dvbqlw2xq4-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/XbYqgyi76ugeT0ChC_Vqfh3q2Yg=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/IHGN6LZZINDINPARSI3HYWKMKE.JPG,Climate and Environment,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,climate refer depend japan assist november meet ocean change share ready veterinary continue male trip public pollution addition otter town distress enrichment milestone watson chief facility ecosystem strand peggy aquarium officer commercial sloan expect interaction urchin warm plan constant population united graze hour commit towel northern disease keystone stabilize giant conservation rehabilitate heal suri bottle month cooper institution maintain receive feed newcomer soft forest decade particularly tiny alaska remain release mother kelp southeast seldovia state reach join orphan overharvest union remote update decline southwest food animal dedicate begin staff coastal consider fishing temperature accord piece luna temporarily heavily aleutian due federal vote include oil fed california island late decimate welcome space small activity bond experience connection engage important clam southern eat columbia october government groom stand willow balance barely red home scene time endanger form young pup specie washington international sight rescue news instance provide center nursery require disappear development life create sealife year formula list eventually healthy predation chicagoans designates monitoring human act fishery peer industrial rise found nature call shedd british habitat,0.97905,0.2647058823529412,11.049055374592832,0.393375241779497,0

The structure looks like a house, he explained, but is actually an apartment building with units on the first and second floors, at at the basement level.He said some remodeling was going on at the building and there were no occupants inside.There were “some tools [inside the building] but nobody lived there,” Terzo explained.The fire destroyed that structure, the chief said, calling the damage “pretty bad.”No injuries were reported and the cause of the blaze is currently under investigation.Terzo said there is “no reason to expect this was anything other than an accident” at this time.The two homes on either side of that building were also affected, sustaining some fire and water damage, he said.The family in the home on the south side of the apartment building was displaced after flames licked that structure. While it was not completely destroyed, the fire and water damage led to the home not being habitable right now, Terzo explained.The home on the north side of the destroyed apartment building has water damage. But, the chief said, the family that lives there is able to stay in the home while the damage is repaired.The chief said the fire at the apartment building was struck less than an hour after firefighters arrived on scene.

Chicago Tribune,"Will County Judge David Carlson calls for special prosecutor after defendant, mistakenly released, not taken back into custody",2023-12-07 09:53:00,Alexandra Kukulka,"Will County Circuit Court Judge David Carlson is calling for a special prosecutor to look into why a defendant released from custody in error wasn’t taken into custody Dec. 1 after the judge ordered him held.Leroy Devine, 34, was arraigned Dec. 1 for two cases against him: one for aggravated fleeing; and one for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, armed habitual criminal and possession or use of a firearm by a felon.Devine was ordered released Oct. 10 on the aggravated fleeing charges, but was still to be held on the other charges, according to Will County Circuit Court records online. Devine’s attorney, Charles Bretz, said he informed the court Oct. 25 that Devine was released “in error,” but that he was in a rehabilitation facility receiving treatment.Bretz said Devine appeared voluntarily for the arraignment Dec. 1, and pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Carlson ordered Devine to be held in custody after his arraignment, but Devine wasn’t taken into custody then, Bretz said.When Bretz informed the judge Tuesday that Devine wasn’t in custody, Carlson ordered Will County Sheriff Mike Kelley and Will County State’s Attorney James Glasgow to come to his courtroom to explain why, but only representatives of the state’s attorney’s office responded.Mary Tatroe, Will County civil division chief at the state’s attorney’s office, told the judge there weren’t any motions or petitions before the court that would require the sheriff to appear, and Chief Deputy State’s Attorney Ken Grey told Carlson he doesn’t have jurisdiction over the sheriff’s office.“When he doesn’t follow the order, I don’t have jurisdiction?” Carlson asked.Carlson said a special prosecutor will help resolve the situation.Whenever changes are made to the legal landscape, Carlson said Kelley and Glasgow inform judges “so fast heads spin.”“You’re saying I don’t have jurisdiction over the sheriff. We’ll soon find out,” Carlson said.Devine, 34, of Shorewood, was charged Oct. 6 with aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and obstructing a police officer. After arresting him, officers learned he had an Oct. 4 Will County warrant issued by Joliet police for aggravated fleeing and eluding a police officer, according to a Joliet police news release.Police said officers on patrol at 12:02 a.m. Oct. 6 in the 100 block of Lois Place saw a Toyota Corolla parked in a lot with people inside. As officers approached, Devine ran from the car, tripping on a curb and dropping a gun, according to the release.Will County sheriff’s office spokeswoman Kathy Hoffmeyer said Devine was in custody from Oct. 6 to Oct. 10, when he was released on a pretrial order.As of Wednesday, Bretz said he wasn’t aware of any motions or orders to bring Devine into custody. According to the Will County sheriff’s office website, Devine isn’t in custody.Grey and Tatroe declined to comment after Tuesday’s hearing, saying the case is pending.Carlson set a court date of Dec. 21 regarding the appointment of a special prosecutor.akukulka@chicagotribune.com",3031,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/ct-sta-wrongful-release-special-prosecutor-st-1207-20231207-ahhq7te5y5crhbw3jutp4bwifu-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/c1NKmKyMTM2R_j5ESGjLQO8BbNQ=/377x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/FZFZTFMV6NHMJCQOCNHBU3T2CY.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police inside kelley motion carlson lot aggravate error change record firearm criminal case curb habitual charles trip resolve aware guilty jurisdiction judge weapon make special charge chief facility court officer custody division patrol courtroom corolla defendant online ken unlawful arrest mike deputy county legal lois tuesday regard date receive attorney voluntarily comment park david kathy find pretrial told landscape release spokeswoman learn devine glasgow plead state place arraignment wednesday elude decline explain representative head car toyota accord shorewood hoffmeyer bretz appointment petition drop circuit fast set james possession sheriff order issue office news obstruct require website rehabilitation grey civil joliet ran gun block bring arm warrant hearing arraign follow approach held tatroe inform call flee prosecutor,-0.9331,0.09897723523589573,9.533036020583186,0.5262987012987013,0

Chicago Tribune,"Mother in critical condition, son’s body pulled from rubble in West Side house fire; ‘Please pray for our family’",2023-12-06 18:26:00,"Deanese Williams-Harris, Alysa Guffey","Carlos Street mostly kept to himself at his home in North Lawndale where he lived with his mother, Dessie Street. Her passion for sewing and crafting clothes for others made her a well-known and familiar face around the neighborhood.On Wednesday morning, family and friends somberly shared stories of the mother and son as they gathered outside the pair’s home that was torched by an overnight fire. Dessie Street escaped the fire and was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition, but Carlos was still missing and family believed he was in the rubble.The group held their breath as the Fire Department carefully lifted up debris in the aftermath of the fire. Joseph Johnson, Carlos’ uncle and Dessie’s brother, cried out when the body of a man was found. He hugged the people around him.“Please pray for our family,” Johnson said.The man had not been identified by the medical examiner’s office as of Wednesday evening but was identified by family as Carlos Street. Records show a man named Carl Street, 51, resides at the address of the fire. No one else was unaccounted for, said Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford.Chicago police officers responded to the home in the 1200 block of South Kedvale Avenue around 1:15 a.m., where 73-year-old Dessie Street was found lying in the grass on the front lawn. Neighbors at the scene alerted police that her son with special needs was missing.Two officers were injured in the search for her son when one officer fell through the porch and became trapped. The officer was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. A second officer suffered a minor ankle injury running from the fire and was released from the hospital.Officials said the cause is under investigation but the severity of the fire and the instability of the structure could make finding the cause difficult. Half a side wall is all that remains of the house.Loved ones gathered outside the home Wednesday shared Dessie’s love of sewing and creating clothes, including prom dresses and holiday outfits for people in the neighborhood.Many years, there would be a line of people down the street and wrapping around the block from her house wanting to order custom holiday outfits, said Linda Ward, 55, of North Lawndale, who said she is related to the family through marriage.Ward was at her house Tuesday to pick up a pair of pants Dessie had altered for a friend of Ward’s. While Ward was there, she and Dessie had talked about the outfit Dessie was creating for Ward.“She had just told me ‘I’m going to start on your outfit,’” Ward said.Ward said Carlos was quiet and didn’t talk much, mainly staying upstairs. But when she saw him Tuesday at the house, he came downstairs to eat pizza with his mother.“He came down and said, ‘Let me get two slices of that pizza,’” she said.Dessie’s sister-in-law, Tomikaa Rainge said she visits Street’s house almost every morning to check in on Dessie and Carlos. On Wednesday morning, she said she was on her way to see them when she saw news of the fire on television.“We would just chat and hold a conversation,” Rainge said of her daily visits.Rainge said Dessie is well-known in the community.“She makes a lot of clothes for a lot of the young people around the neighborhood,” Rainge said.Dessie Street, who turns 74 Thursday, has several children, but Carlos was the only child who lived with her, family said. The mother and son spent most of their time together and were “very close,” Rainge said.She said they were “a close-knit family.”“They never bothered anyone,” Rainge said.dawilliams@chicagotribune.comaguffey@chicagotribune.com",3629,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-lawndale-fire-injures-three-20231206-iqq5tbcahzgppafu2343w2fs6y-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/6Aw3CpVG2f5nn9dbZ_CEnjUdJs4=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/ODAI6HGD4NBFVFS7J7YUAXHCKI.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police trap visit lot respond condition share record bother investigation carl morning line conversation fire alter examiner remains sew critical make stay side upstairs unaccounted special officer half linda close torched porch body joseph lawndale cry medical passion carefully kedvale family ward somberly believe neighbor friend address outfit pray brother hold tuesday difficult front start alert ankle johnson group find avenue told slice release mother love child check sinai time dress aftermath transport lift street clothes wednesday wrap identify story department injury uncle structure live include prom hospital neighborhood minor run escape eat tomikaa chat breath injured suffer debris home spokesman north fell scene order holiday miss talk downstairs familiar rainge severity young pant resides house custom office mount wall news pair show turn hug pick search craft create daily carlos overnight year block spent pizza lawn south thursday related held dessie gather found lie grass instability larry quiet,-0.31520000000000004,0.16533480297602646,9.151896551724136,0.3493533215755438,0
Chicago Tribune,‘It felt like a shakedown’; Witness challenged by defense about meeting with Ald. Ed Burke on Burger King renovation,2023-12-06 18:01:00,Jason Meisner,"A former executive involved in the remodeling of a Southwest Side Burger King testified Wednesday that an early meeting about the project where then-Ald. Edward Burke demanded charitable donations and other concessions “felt like a shakedown.”Jeff MacDonald, who was in charge in the early stages of the renovation of the restaurant in Burke’s 14th Ward, also told the jury in Burke’s corruption trial that the alderman asked him at the end of the March 2017 meeting who did the property tax work for MacDonald’s Houston-based bosses.MacDonald testified his response to Burke was “that I didn’t know, and that it was probably done out of Houston,” adding that Burke seemed “irritated” and the whole meeting, which was also attended by Burke’s longtime ward aide Peter Andrews Jr., made him “uncomfortable.”Lawyers for the defense seized on those comments in cross examination, however, pointing out that MacDonald had never mentioned anything about Burke’s alleged inquiry into property tax work when he was interviewed at length by the FBI in April 2019.MacDonald, who at the time was regional director of Downers Grove-based Tri-City Foods, also had not mentioned it in any of the emails he sent to colleagues about the 2017 meeting with Burke, even though he’d listed other issues the powerful alderman had raised, such as an outdated driveway permit and trucks parking in the Burger King lot overnight.In fact, the first time MacDonald mentioned it to anybody was just a few weeks ago when he was interviewed in preparation for his trial testimony, attorney Patrick Blegen, who represents Andrews, pointed out, showing MacDonald the interview report.“Are you the kind of person whose memory gets better the further away you get from an event?” Blegen asked somewhat rhetorically, leading the judge to sustain an objection from prosecutors.Blegen suggested MacDonald came up with new information after reading stories about the charges against Burke in the newspaper.Fumbling a bit for answers, MacDonald admitted he “knew (the case) involved Burger King and the remodel,” but not specifically anything about Burke requesting tax appeal work.Burke’s attorney, Chris Gair, also took aim at MacDonald’s claim that Burke’s request for donations to local charities such as the Greater Chicago Food Depository and the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council were somehow untoward, as well as his comment in an email that driveway permits were just “another money grab” by the city.“You used the term ‘shakedown’ for a philanthropic request for the Chicago Food Depository. ... Did you know that they serve 77 million meals a year to hungry people in Chicago?” Gair asked.“I didn’t know that,” MacDonald said.The second suggestion from Burke was “to hire young people who needed work” that had been sent over by the Back of the Yards group, Gair noted.“I recall he mentioned it as a potential philanthropic opportunity,” MacDonald said after a long pause.“You didn’t actually feel that that was a shakedown did you sir?” Gair said.“It felt like a shakedown,” MacDonald insisted.Gair also asked MacDonald about a law enforcement report showing he’d recently told agents that another, unidentified alderman once hit him up to buy a table at a political fundraiser. MacDonald testified he didn’t remember saying that.“Sir, do you have memory issues?” Gair asked.Prosecutors objected and it was sustained.MacDonald was among nearly a dozen witnesses called so far in the Burger King episode, one of four alleged schemes outlined in the racketeering indictment against Burke.According to the charges, when the owners of the Burger King dragged their feet on hiring Burke’s firm to do property tax appeals, Burke allegedly enlisted the help of Andrews to shut down the renovation project over drummed-up permit issues.Also testifying Wednesday were two witnesses from the architectural firm that worked on the renovation, as well as two underlings who dealt with the Burger King permit issue at the city’s Department of Buildings.Late in the day, prosecutors called Judy Frydland, the former Buildings commissioner, who also factors into other episodes in the indictment involving the Old Post Office renovation and a Binny’s Beverage Depot pole sign application.Frydland, who stepped down in 2020 after a three-decade career at City Hall, testified her dealings with Burke were limited to “hellos” in the hallways and maybe a dozen phone conversations where he wanted to talk about a Buildings Department issue in his ward.She said aldermen often called her department with complaints or other items, but it was “neighbor disputes” — not the aldermen — that were the toughest to handle.“They couldn’t shut down the project could they?” asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Chapman.“No, but they did call every single day,” she said, drawing laughter in the courtroom.In November 2017, Frydland did meet with one the Burger King owners, as well as the architect, Warren Johnson, about the project, but she said it was largely a meet-and-greet and the permitting issues they’d had were only briefly touched on.Her testimony is expected to continue Thursday.Burke, 79, who served 54 years as alderman before leaving the City Council in May, is charged with 14 counts including racketeering, federal program bribery, attempted extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion and using interstate commerce to facilitate an unlawful activity.Andrews, 73, is charged with one count of attempted extortion, one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, two counts of using interstate commerce to facilitate an unlawful activity and one count of making a false statement to the FBI.A third defendant, Lake Forest developer Charles Cui, 52, is not charged as part of the Burger King episode. He’s facing counts of federal program bribery, using interstate commerce to facilitate an unlawful activity, and making a false statement to the FBI.The high-profile trial, which has been twice delayed by COVID-19 issues since beginning Nov. 6, is still on track to finish before the Christmas holiday. Prosecutors told U.S. District Virginia Kendall they expect to rest their case in chief by Tuesday.Prosecutors spent much of Wednesday diving into the nitty-gritty bureaucracy involved with the permitting process at City Hall, including whether the owners who had acquired the 14th Ward Burger King had properly reapplied for a driveway permit before starting the renovation.On Oct. 26, 2017, after Andrews ordered the Burger King construction site shut down, Johnson, the architect, frantically emailed Buildings Department employee Hal Hutchinson and others, saying he found it to be a “quite disturbing” power move by the alderman’s office.“This does not seem right that Burke can shut this project down” since they had their permit, the email read.Hutchinson looked into it but could not find any evidence of a stop work order issued by the Buildings Department, and told Johnson to take it up with Burke, according to his trial testimony.On cross examination by Andrews’ attorney Todd Pugh, Hutchinson acknowledged the email from Johnson had mistakenly referenced special use permits, which have to do with the Burger King drive-thru, not the driveways.The defense has contended that the driveway issue was of legitimate concern to the alderman’s office as it would expose the city to liability if the permit was not current.The highlight the Burger King testimony this week came from Zohaib Dhanani, a vice president for the company founded by his father, Dhanani Group, which owned about 160 Burger Kings in the Chicago area, including the one being renovated in Burke’s ward.Dhanani was among a series of witnesses to paint Burke as wearing two hats, both as the City Council’s most powerful and longest-serving alderman and as a private lawyer prowling for business for his firm, Klafter & Burke.Dhanani was asked Tuesday about a phone call he had with Burke on June 27, 2017, two weeks after he and his father met with Burke at the Burger King site on South Pulaski Road, where they talked about a driveway permit as well as complaints about trucks parking overnight in the lot.It was after that meeting that Burke took the Dhananis to lunch at the Beverly Country Club and first pitched his law firm to them, according to testimony.In the call, Burke got down to brass tacks, saying, “We were going to talk about the real estate tax representation and you were going to have somebody get in touch with me so we can expedite your permits,” Burke said.“I’m sorry, Mr. Burke, what was that last part?” Dhanani responded.Dhanani told Burke he would follow up with the architect about the necessary driveway permit and “have somebody from our Houston office reach out to you regarding the property taxes” since that wasn’t something he normally handled.“OK, good,” Burke said. “I look forward to hearing from you and thanks for being responsive.”Though steps were taken by Dhanani group to give business to Burke, no deal was ever finalized, according to testimony.jmeisner@chicagotribune.com",9068,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-ald-ed-burke-corruption-trial-day-16-20231206-avols7kplvciho5cn4oxkxvmua-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/yukkzg6xHk9gz31cfKiilwKADm0=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/3NHFXK52JNHTXC7TO2TFATJ4ZE.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,country

Chicago Tribune,Chicago Bears reportedly mulling Soldier Field parking area as new stadium site as talks resume with schools over Arlington Heights location,2023-12-06 18:00:00,Robert McCoppin,"The Chicago Bears continue to check out a variety of sites in and around Chicago — including the site of Soldier Field — as potential homes for a new stadium, officials said Wednesday.The Bears are doing due diligence on the viability of the south parking lot at Soldier Field as the location for their next stadium, according to unnamed sources cited by The Parkins & Spiegel Show on WSCR-AM 670 The Score.The Bears have proposed building a $5 billion enclosed stadium and entertainment and housing complex on the site of the closed Arlington International Racecourse in Arlington Heights. The project has stalled while the team tries to negotiate favorable property taxes for the site.The Bears reportedly are using the same surveying firm, Compass Surveying Ltd. in Aurora, that they used for Arlington Heights and other potential locations.In response, the Bears would not confirm the report, but issued the following brief statement:“As we stated in September earlier this year, we want to appropriately explore all opportunities across Chicagoland for the development of a world-class stadium.”In September, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren stated that the team was continuing a “methodical” process to find the best stadium solution.“Thanks to the leadership of Mayor Brandon Johnson and his team, we have recently engaged in positive and productive discussions with the city of Chicago,” Warren said. “We also continue to have dialogue with officials in Arlington Heights and other Chicagoland locations about a Chicago Bears stadium project.”While continuing such discussions this fall, the team did not pursue previous state legislative proposals for tax breaks to build a stadium — but a new legislative session starts in the new year.The Bears have met with officials in Naperville. Aurora, Waukegan and Richton Park also expressed interest in hosting the team.The parking area south of Soldier Field includes a garage and a ground-level lot. The area is party central for tailgating fans.The area once was recommended by a mayoral task force as the site of the proposed Lucas Museum.But “Star Wars” creator George Lucas, who planned to house his significant art and movie memorabilia collection there, dropped his plan in 2016 after the nonprofit group Friends of the Parks filed a lawsuit seeking to block the proposal. Any plans for a new stadium there might face similar objections.The Bears have also resumed communications with school officials regarding the Arlington Heights site, Arlington Heights Mayor Tom Hayes told the Tribune. That comes after the two sides had reached an impasse over property taxes and broken off negotiations for months.Palatine Community Consolidated School District 15, Arlington Heights-based Township High School District 214 and Palatine-based Township High School District 211 have sought millions of dollars more in property taxes from the site.To lower those taxes, the team this summer demolished the former Arlington Park and related buildings.rmccoppin@chicagotribune.com",3032,https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bears/ct-chicago-bears-soldier-field-arlington-heights-20231207-7me6f5pl6vab7gcxxkm73msqua-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/w5QQOa3dgGoF47S2EYu7r6RslCs=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/7W37M6TPYBGOLN2K2LGR656LWQ.JPG,Sports,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,interest leadership lot september central fall broken dollar chicago response collection recommend continue resume parking negotiate bear garage tax party appropriately force sought side discussion city racecourse movie close firm nonprofit pursue stadium ceo diligence opportunity similar session arlington project plan richton memorabilia productive recently tribune friend previous president hayes regard start spiegel johnson park creator express group property kevin find waukegan told building legislative naperville check township state proposal school reach entertainment mayoral host file seek low task tom unnamed positive high accord due earlier soldier process include mayor potential stall drop engage favorable reportedly aurora build chicagoland significant break housing viability home compass variety million explore george complex impasse statement issue international site house lucas art star demolish tailgate confirm show enclose parkins development propose former summer field year dialogue block location methodical source survey follow south brandon related communication consolidated billion district report height negotiation community area lawsuit official warren team,0.9592,0.0,13.493070866141728,0.3905324675324675,0

Bally’s Chicago hosted 86,459 visitors during November, up more than 3,000 from the previous month.The Chicago casino ranked fourth in revenue and second in admissions in November among the state’s 15 casinos, according to Gaming Board data. Rivers Casino Des Plaines led the way with $43.5 million in adjusted gross receipts and 249,000 admissions.Statewide casino revenue was up $1.3 million to $130.4 million for the month.“This is our third month in operation and we are pleased that business continues to build steadily,” a Bally’s spokesperson said Wednesday.Rhode Island-based Bally’s won a heated competition last year, besting four other proposals with its plan to build a $1.74 billion casino at the 30-acre Freedom Center printing plant site in River West. The permanent casino is expected to open in 2026.The temporary casino opened Sept. 9 at the 130,000-square-foot Medinah Temple, a landmarked, 111-year-old Moorish-style amphitheater in River North that once hosted the annual Shrine Circus. Bally’s spent about $50 million to renovate the three-story, block-long building on North Wabash Avenue, which now houses nearly 800 slot machines and 56 gaming tables, an expansive blue-lit center bar, two restaurants and a coffee shop.Since opening, Bally’s has taken in nearly $21.9 million in adjusted gross receipts — the money kept after winnings are paid out. That has generated about $2.8 million in state tax revenue and more than $2.2 million in local tax revenue over three months, according to Gaming Board data.The temporary casino, which was initially slated to open in June, was projected to generate more than $100 million in adjusted gross receipts this year. The city expected to receive nearly $70 million from the casino in 2023, including a one-time $40 million upfront payment from Bally’s and about $13 million in gaming tax revenue.With the launch pushed back to September, Bally’s reduced projections to between $15 million and $25 million in adjusted gross receipts for the temporary casino this year, according to an August investor presentation.The temporary casino is expected to boost revenues as its offerings expand, including a planned sportsbook down the road.In addition, Bally’s Chicago, which is open 20 hours per day, is awaiting permission from the Gaming Board to go full time like Rivers Casino and other established venues. The casino is also looking for approval from the city to implement valet parking to make it easier for customers to visit.rchannick@chicagotribune.com",2905,https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-ballys-chicago-casino-revenues-november-20231206-gvfhew3ujngvznutm5jh44bqpi-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/OhRvVqBMatmnCS3QCjgT_hMRgAM=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(1818x1247:1828x1257)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/E7SPNJUYUBG4FCS2JMY4CANAFM.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,permanent initially visitor payment september renovate chicago november june back continue circus generate receipt amphitheater parking addition tax make launch illinois city table shrine competition annual flat expect plant steadily opening reduce pleased paid plan project temporary full hour venue implement previous temple open admission month investor receive printing data day revenue easy avenue river building lead fourth push state game proposal slot upfront expand restaurant host ranked match adjust total wabash local gross besting accord august include establish heat october board money build operation sportsbook approval customer million west north time plaines await bar site house projection permission expansive bally center landmarked offering coffee year medinah publish boost spent freedom slat business billion valet spokesperson winning awaits machine casino,0.95495,0.0,11.40038314176245,0.2490240240240241,0
Chicago Tribune,"Kennedy Expressway lanes to reopen, as first year of construction project ends",2023-12-06 17:15:00,Sarah Freishtat,"Kennedy Expressway drivers heading toward downtown Chicago will get a reprieve from construction delays, as lanes begin reopening after nearly nine months of work.The reopening marks the end of the first year of a three-year, $150 million rehab of the highway from the I-94 split south to downtown. But it will only be a temporary respite for the estimated 275,000 drivers who use the expressway daily. Work is expected to pick back up again in the spring on the next phase of the project, in the reversible express lanes in the center of the highway.Lanes are expected to begin reopening Friday morning, but it will take overnight lane and ramp closures over several days to remove the construction zone. And the work schedule could change depending on the weather, officials with the Illinois Department of Transportation said.If weather allows, by 5 a.m. Friday the inbound, or southbound, Kennedy is set to fully reopen from Kimball Avenue south. By 8 a.m. Saturday the expressway will fully reopen from Keeler Avenue south. And by 5 a.m. Tuesday the entire expressway will fully reopen, and the express lanes in the center of the highway will resume their typical reversible schedule.Overnight Friday, beginning at 8 p.m., the inbound Kennedy will be reduced to one lane between Kimball and Milwaukee avenues, and entrance and exit ramps in that area will close intermittently. The express lanes will close at midnight, and reopen in the southbound direction only the following morning.Overnight Friday similar lane closures will take place between Keeler and Kimball avenues, though the express lanes will stay open. Overnight Monday closures are set to take place from north of the I-94 split to Keeler Avenue, including access to the express lanes at the split.Other, temporary lane closures are still likely in the coming weeks to complete last pieces of work, IDOT officials said.The project is rehabbing 7.5 miles of the 10-lane expressway, from the split at I-94 south to Ohio Street, and at the massive underpass near Hubbard Street downtown. It includes rehabbing 36 bridges and the highway’s reversible express lane access system, replacing overhead signs, upgrading lighting, paving and painting. It is also set to include painting and installing new lighting at the Hubbard underpass between Ohio and Lake streets.Work is scheduled to take place during warm-weather seasons through late fall 2025. It began this year with the inbound lanes, with two closed at a time since March and the express lanes in the center of the highway open only heading toward downtown.In spring, work is planned to move to the reversible express lanes, which will close. Other closures in the regular lanes could take place while work continues at the Hubbard underpass.Work is set to move to the outbound, or northbound, lanes in spring 2025. Two lanes will close at a time, and the express lanes will remain open in only the outbound direction.sfreishtat@chicagotribune.com",2971,https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-kennedy-construction-year-one-ending-20231206-eytdpffkkfg6rlzj5bfgrd6bnu-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/5cAZOcyMdzDdKHwDs0egSJnPHFM=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(2305x1615:2315x1625)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/QOIYA7G4Y5CC3HA5LVXH6LBZKM.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,weather spring fall depend chicago lake intermittently change fully back complete morning resume continue northbound outbound stay schedule phase typical illinois bridge close expect closure reduce similar direction ohio access plan project zone idot temporary expressway painting work mark keeler instal system open tuesday month rehab entrance rehabbing day express overhead avenue remain reprieve season week remove place saturday delay street department head begin replace regular move monday entire piece respite transportation include lane kennedy late pave construction reversible estimate set highway million north sign underpass time midnight split driver center ramp exit light pick hubbard friday daily overnight year kimball mile southbound south milwaukee follow march massive inbound downtown area upgrade reopen official,-0.1591,0.10097610232245034,11.314600760456273,0.41973339160839157,0
Chicago Tribune,Advisory council created to ensure diversity in businesses participating in next year’s Democratic National Convention,2023-12-06 16:57:00,Rick Pearson,"The host committee for next year’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago announced Wednesday the creation of an advisory council to assist efforts to ensure broad involvement of businesses owned by diverse racial, ethnic and gender entrepreneurs in the convention.The council will work with the host committee to set diversity spending goals as well as to establish equity practices, community engagement strategies and contract and event execution plans, the host committee said.Co-chairing the diversity council are Jaemie Neely, executive director of the Federation of Women Contractors, and Jackie Gomez, executive director of the Hispanic American Construction Industry Association.The host committee wants to ensure that the August convention “highlights and utilizes Chicago’s robust diverse business community,” said Christy George, the committee’s executive director. Creating the council “is a critical step in ensuring business and individuals from a wide array of backgrounds have a seat at the table where decisions are being made,” George said.Neely said the diversity council provides an opportunity for “promoting equity and inclusion in the business landscape” and said the economic impact of the DNC will “create new opportunities for businesses, showcasing their proven talents and capabilities to the world.”The diversity council, made up of representatives from more than 20 Illinois-based organizations that focus on creating a more diverse and inclusive workforce, will hold its first meeting Monday.Representatives include members of the Native American Chamber of Commerce of Illinois; Black Contractors Owners and Executives; Chicagoland Alliance for Disabled-Owned Businesses; Asian American Chamber of Commerce of Illinois; LGBT Chamber of Commerce of Illinois; Veteran Business Outreach Center; Black Contractors United; and the Chicago Urban League.rap30@aol.com",1896,https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-dnc-chicago-2024-diversity-vendor-panel-20231206-wcvjjq5zrzb2hpsak2ua5xzkye-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Zzsk8IBHeuvev_4bJFiYuF9md3s=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/7SJFTO2KFBABPCUWYMZJIIMFRQ.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,advisory chicago assist capability seat owner broad critical make american convention creation spending wide promote illinois table highlight economic talent contract opportunity plan alliance united industry entrepreneur proven work effort array diversity practice robust jaemie execution black democratic landscape chamber goal executive contractor ethnic gender christy wednesday host dnc decision native representative equity focus august diverse outreach event establish include director commerce federation council veteran neely construction impact inclusive engagement meeting chicagoland ensure set involvement woman individual announce george hold background inclusion asian jackie provide center national create urban workforce gomez year utilizes step lgbt strategy member business racial hispanic community showcasing organization committee,0.97515,0.15822784810126583,15.779337748344371,0.24037081339712915,0
Chicago Tribune,McDonald’s will open first CosMc’s spinoff in suburban Bolingbrook this week,2023-12-06 16:16:00,Talia Soglin,"The week after photos of its new spinoff CosMc’s in suburban Bolingbrook surfaced on social media, McDonald’s officially announced the concept at an investor day in Chicago Wednesday.CosMc’s, named after a McDonald’s character from the 1980s whom CEO Chris Kempczinski described as “part alien, part surfer, part robot,” will be a 10-store, small-format pilot concept focused around specialty beverages and coffees. A CosMc’s in Bolingbrook will mark a soft opening Friday, the company said. The remaining stores will open in Texas by the end of 2024.Kempczinski said Wednesday the fast-food giant had identified specialty beverages and coffees as a fast-growing area in which the company was underindexed.“We can’t capitalize (on) this in our existing restaurants because of the complexity that customized beverages would bring to our kitchens,” Kempczinski said.Offerings at CosMc’s will include specialty coffees such as a S’Mores Cold Brew and a Turmeric Spiced Latte, the company said. Other drinks include new specialty teas and lemonades that consumers will be able to customize with additions like boba or vitamin C shots. New food offerings include a spicy queso sandwich, pretzel bites and desserts such as caramel fudge brownies and sundaes.Kempczinski emphasized the new concept was a pilot and said the company would be looking at results from the test stores for at least a year.“Let me emphasize again, we’re talking about 10 stores,” he told investors Wednesday. “So let’s not get too excited about it.”Prior to the official announcement Wednesday, photos of the CosMc’s menu had surfaced on social media. X user Iman Jalali posted photos of a beverage-heavy CosMc’s menu on the social media site, which was formerly known as Twitter.Kempczinksi first teased CosMc’s during a second-quarter earnings call this summer. He revealed scant details about the spinoff at the time, describing it as a “small-format concept with all the DNA of McDonald’s but its own unique personality.”Growth in the fast-food giant’s digital and delivery business has paved the way for it to take advantage of smaller-format stores as real estate opportunities, Kempczinski said this summer.“You’re now able to look at real estate sites that previously would have been sort of off-limits to us,” he said. “Those become opportunities.”Prior to its investor update Wednesday, McDonald’s announced it planned to open about 10,000 new stores by the end of 2027 for a total of 50,000 stores worldwide, which the company said would mark its fastest period of growth ever. The majority of the new stores will be abroad, Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden said Wednesday.The company also announced a partnership with Google Cloud, saying it planned to use Cloud technology and AI to make improvements in areas like its mobile app and self-serve kiosks.Claire Conaghan, associate director of publications at Chicago-based food industry market research firm Datassential, said McDonald’s wasn’t launching CosMc’s because they aren’t succeeding in other parts of their business.“I think it’s simply another opportunity for them,” said Conaghan, speaking before Wednesday’s official announcement.The fast-food giant posted net income of $2.3 billion in the third quarter, with same-store sales in the U.S. up 8.1%.Still, McDonald’s saw a “slight dip” in traffic during the quarter, Kempczinski said during an October earnings call. The company had specifically seen consumers making less than $45,000 a year pull back, he said.The smaller scale of the CosMc’s concept allows McDonald’s to be more “playful” with its CosMc’s menu than it can be with its main menu, Conaghan said. “It’s hard to introduce something like a Popping Pear Slush,” she said, referring to one of the CosMc’s menu items.“It’s hard to guarantee you’ll have enough popping pears for the entire McDonald’s universe, while it’s a little easier to do it for one or two stores,” she said.",3937,https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-mcdonalds-cosmcs-bolingbrook-20231206-fkize2wyorfxnlsnkcrdshbrwi-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/wyE3Veq5sVSJF-CpfT1R7j31peA=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/GCWETTFF6JE2JBIX2DC7A3ALO4.JPG,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,user specialty refer chicago quarter succeed back describe pull complexity mobile datassential spinoff addition partnership guarantee app firm described ceo sort ian kempczinski menu iman unique sandwich turmeric company open mcdonald vitamin brownie bolingbrook day slush told formerly remain dip wednesday medium kitchen tea total digital financial pop emphasize drink texas latte small bite technology suburban beverage october cold reveal net fast talk growth boba site borden market dessert test simply playful pear exist period friday publication bring year hard slight post universe specifically officially result advantage introduce official worldwide social surface associate character alien caramel majority surfer lemonade photo tease make estate chief launch store opening opportunity scant plan industry x cloud announcement mark giant conaghan chris concept investor brew fudge part robot soft easy research improvement week scale cosmc restaurant update identify food queso jalali speak entire focus consumer abroad prior include excite director pave real previously announce income time delivery detail spice shot pilot earnings offering coffee summer google capitalize customize business billion pretzel call traffic area dna officer spicy,0.97685,0.0762001524003048,9.31769633507853,0.4162153883851997,0
Chicago Tribune,"Dolton trustees at odds with Mayor Tiffany Henyard hold special meeting to approve bills and tax levy, but defer action on budget",2023-12-06 15:28:00,Mike Nolan,"A day after walking out on a Village Board meeting, four Dolton trustees at odds with Mayor Tiffany Henyard held a special meeting Tuesday to approve a tentative tax levy and talk about a village that remains divided.Meeting at a Dolton Park District facility with about two dozen residents attending, the trustees said they are trying to be good stewards of taxpayer money, but are being kept in the dark about the true state of village finances.Trustee Jason House, selected to lead the meeting, told residents trustees were not supplied with sufficient information about agenda items to be acted on at Monday’s meeting, and said the information they received came late.That led to the majority of six trustees voting to adjourn the meeting and leaving, although Henyard continued the Monday’s meeting in their absence.At Tuesday’s meeting, House and Trustees Kiana Belcher, Tammy Brown, Brittney Norwood and Village Clerk Alison Key discussed approving minutes of past meetings, paying bills and setting a tax levy for the coming year.The estimated levy of $14.8 million is down from a proposed levy of $15.9 million, which would have represented an increase of 5% from the 2022 levy for property taxes collected last year.Adopting the levy is “one of the most important things we do as a board,” Norwood said.Trustees held off on approving the village’s budget, with Belcher saying she is not comfortable with the numbers being presented.“The numbers are fictitious, inflated, not realistic,” Belcher said.The village’s fiscal year began May 1 and trustees this summer had considered a tentative spending plan, but nothing was formally approved, House said.The trustees did approve the payroll and some bills, but held off approval on some items, including legal expenses and bills for tree trimming. They said they have been asked at Village Board meetings to approve bills for expenses they were not aware of and for contracts they did not approve.“These special meetings are required because we are not getting the information due to us to make the best financial decisions,” Belcher said.House and other trustees said notice of the special meeting was posted Sunday, ahead of the regular Monday meeting, and that all Village Board members were notified by email. Henyard did not attend the special meeting nor did Trustees Stanley Brown and Andrew Holmes.Village Board meetings have led to lengthy discussions about issues such as what vendors are being hired for work, and the state of village finances. House said recent financial reports received by trustees show a deficit approaching $7 million.Dolton is “still a town divided unfortunately,” House said of the relationship among trustees and village administration.“We really need for our community to move forward,” he said.At board meetings “when we ask questions there is a lot of tension and anger,” and that has necessitated special meetings, he said.If issues could be hashed out at regularly scheduled meetings “that would be easier for the residents, the board and for the community as a whole,” he said.Henyard did not immediately respond to messages on Wednesday.Village Administrator Keith Freeman, accompanied by a uniformed Dolton police officer, came into Tuesday’s meeting after it was underway.Freeman said an email sent Sunday to the Village Board regarding the levy was a precursor to a more thorough outline, which the board is scheduled to vote on at its Dec. 26 meeting.Freeman said his working relationship with the trustees at the special meeting has been “contentious at best,” but that “I think for the most part I’ve been respectful to all of you.”mnolan@tribpub.com",3656,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/ct-sta-dolton-special-board-meeting-st-1207-20231206-jqtg6j7ptjhqjpyqdhb7xkaute-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/c1NKmKyMTM2R_j5ESGjLQO8BbNQ=/377x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/FZFZTFMV6NHMJCQOCNHBU3T2CY.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police lengthy freeman dozen taxpayer lot respond increase village minute hash inflate majority number accompany odds aware tension town tax remains dolton make vendor relationship schedule sunday special mnolan ahead facility discussion henyard spending trim officer forward continued keith belcher hire contract fiscal plan trustee andrew regularly recent administrator respectful leave uniformed work discuss legal tuesday regard represent question email receive agenda part park day walk easy property message told tammy key alison lead outline notify state approve contentious bill finance select decision financial jason dark begin consider regular move monday tiffany collect due vote information pay include tentative mayor expense past clerk important brown steward budget estimate board meeting money adjourn deficit supply stanley set realistic approval million notice talk anger issue levy item house formally show fictitious require necessitate propose summer year immediately resident unfortunately voting norwood kiana divide post payroll approach member act held attend comfortable district precursor report tree brittney community sufficient,0.9296,0.0,11.284042232277528,0.41949476949476944,0

He’s worked for the department for five years.State prosecutors will partner with the DeKalb County State’s Attorney Office on the case. Collins’ next court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 20.“All child predators, particularly those in a position of authority, must be held accountable for the horrific crime of child pornography that can leave life-long scars on victims and their families,” Attorney Kwame Raoul said in a statement on the arrest.“I am absolutely committed to working with local law enforcement agencies to protect communities from offenders who exploit children – even if those individuals are themselves supposed to be keeping their communities safe.”Elgin Police Chief Ana Lalley also released a statement saying her department responded swiftly when informed of the situation.“This officer was placed on administrative leave immediately following the arrest with additional action expected following review of the criminal charges,” Lalley said.“The criminal actions of a single police officer do not define the Elgin Police Department. This department will never deviate from upholding the highest standards of integrity, accountability and dedication to the community it serves.”The Attorney General’s Office, with funding from the U.S. Department of Justice, runs the Illinois Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, which investigates child exploitation crimes and trains law enforcement agencies to do the same.",2132,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/elgin-courier-news/ct-ecn-elgin-cop-charged-child-porn-st-1208-20231206-ni45grdjtnhplcqiifaornpmxq-story.html,https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/jHBP6Ay41vZrxkSd3oG42DKUgtA=/377x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/VET36BLXDBHFTHXXH2EV4KR3YU.jpg,Politics,https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.bdQ4hj2mS6umETrhkh7uTQAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=180,police victim funding kwame dedication respond assist lalley criminal case justice uphold administrative force appearance schedule charge jail chief court officer illinois suppose expect agency define ana investigates family pornography commit arrest leave enforcement work deviate county raoul posession swiftly job attorney law review particularly elgin release child state crime place offender wednesday file street task cooperation department high train partner exploitation local evidence monday accord residence position felony protect predator general run night accountable kirkland individual sheriff action statement additional exploit office authority collins news accountability standard internet integrity count search absolutely duty immediately block investigator horrific follow single held report scar found inform community prosecutor dekalb,-0.94895,0.14071294559099437,13.500055401662049,0.31933106575963716,0
